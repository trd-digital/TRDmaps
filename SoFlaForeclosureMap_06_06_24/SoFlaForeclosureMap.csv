Gomez Development took out a $15M loan from Rok Lending. At some point, Rok Lending assigned its rights in the mortgage to Banesco, though Rok Lending retained the right to foreclose on the mortgage if it needed to. The complaint says Gomez Development failed to make monthly payments from July 2023 to January this year. At the time the complaint was filed in March, Rok Lending alleged Gomez Development owed $16.6M, including late fees and default interest. In its May court response, Gomz Development said that the amounts allegedly owed are inaccurate, including the default interest, the Octobert late fee and the exit fee. The amount owed, if any, is less andGomez Development calls for accounting to determine what is owed. Gomez Development also wrote that Rok Lending ""knows that any action taken in regard to a foreclosure will prevent the refinancing, obtaining a construction loan and/or otherwise prevent the sale of the property and increase damages."" Rok Lending ""acquiesced in forbearing its remedies and otherwise modifying the terms of the loan. Further, by pursuing these remedies, Plaintiff is chilling any marketing efforts by Property Owner to sell the Property and make the Plaintiff whole."" Also, at some point after the alleged default, Rok Lending accepted partial payments. Gomez Development says the note was accelerated. Rok Lending does not specify the timeframe when default interest started to accrue and also the two sides had been in discussions for a modification. The amount owed is miscalculated.
