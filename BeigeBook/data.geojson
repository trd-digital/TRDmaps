{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "City": "New York, NY", "Real Estate Summary": "New York City is the nation’s largest and most expensive real estate market, both for residential and commercial. But its sectors and subsectors often move in different directions, as the pandemic and post-pandemic years have reminded us.<br><br>\n\n\nHousing in Gotham is infamously tight, resulting in high market-rate rents and home prices and less than 1 percent vacancy for rent-stabilized units. The disruption caused by the pandemic, which caused unprecedented drops in rents and increases in vacancy, proved short-lived.<br><br>\n\n\nRents bounced back in 2021 and continued growing for about two years before stabilizing at record levels. Owners of market-rate multifamily buildings prospered as demand grew more than supply. The seemingly perpetual housing shortage has persisted since a multi-year period after the Great Recession when production fell to about half of usual levels.<br><br>\n\n\nTwo years passed between the expiration of the 421a tax break for multifamily projects and the passage of its replacement, 485x, a lull that squeezed the supply pipeline.<br><br>\n\n\nMeanwhile, rents at regulated units, which make up about half of the city’s rental stock, were outpaced by operating costs as inflation rose, devaluing those properties — a painful period for owners compounded by the rise in interest rates that began in March 2022 and only abated this year. Avenues for landlords to substantially raise rents by improving individual units and buildings were cut off by a rent-law overhaul in 2019.<br><br>\n\n\nCondo development and sales, especially on the luxury side, have been steady, with elevated mortgage rates not especially deterring buyers who pay in cash more than in most cities. The glut of high-end condo units that followed a mid-2010s building bonanza has given way to more typical inventory levels, and demand to own homes in New York remains strong, despite a pullback by some foreign buyers.<br><br>\n\n\nOn the commercial side, distress has ripped through the office market, with the exception of the nicest, newest buildings near Grand Central Terminal and Hudson Yards.<br><br>\n\n\nClass A buildings more than a few blocks from transit hubs and more than a few years removed from their last renovation have found themselves out of favor. Replacing their expiring, interest-only loans has been a major challenge for owners, who in some cases have had to hand over the keys to lenders. Others have negotiated workouts, which typically involve lenders writing down loans rather than foreclosing on unwanted buildings that would only sell at bargain prices, if at all.<br><br>\n\n\nThe combination of an office glut and housing shortage has given rise to an increasing number of conversions. Such projects — whether planned or underway — are increasingly taking office space off the market, but the sheer amount of square footage available has minimized the effect on rents and vacancy rates.<br><br>\n\n\nThe retail sector has been a surprise star for the past couple of years, as it turns out people don’t want to do all of their shopping from a screen. Storefront vacancies have been dropping since the Covid shock, and some megadeals on Fifth Avenue have reminded the world of the prestige that luxury retailers attach to New York. A steady increase in tourism has helped.<br><br>\n\n\nBut the return of visitors — domestic ones in particular — has benefited the hospitality industry even more, as has a government crackdown on short-term rentals by Airbnb. The results can be seen in the hotels’ high room rates and occupancy figures, which have also been aided by city contracts to house migrants’ taking some properties off the market.<br><br>\n\n\nA boom in the industrial sector, powered by online shopping and internet retailers’ suddenly insatiable thirst for distribution centers, was a bright spot in the years leading up to the pandemic and especially during it. Growing demand for self-storage was a factor as well.<br><br>\n\n\nBut Amazon scaled back its plans for distribution centers and the industrial real estate surge leveled off, causing project filings for multi-level warehouses to slow considerably. The storage sector continues to grow, however, in part because the multifamily market’s record-low 1.4 percent vacancy rate has made it difficult for New Yorkers to relocate.<br><br>\n\n\n<em>— Senior managing editor Erik Engquist.
