In the Boston area, legal and financial tenants continued to provide decent office demand, but weak demand from high tech firms persisted. The life sciences industry buoyed leasing activity in Providence, but not enough to drive meaningful changes in vacancy rates or rents. Contacts reported no recent office foreclosures, though many properties remained distressed. Industrial leasing was stable but on the slower side, especially for larger spaces, although industrial sales picked up moderately. Retail leasing was stable, and retail rents showed slight increases. Lending conditions remained tight relative to historical norms, especially for office properties, while funding was comparatively more available for industrial and multifamily properties. The outlook for the sector was mixed, with some contacts expecting no major changes in conditions and others expecting a significant increase in activity in 2025 as election-related uncertainty was resolved and interest rates fell further.  First District residential home sales in August 2024 were up modestly from a year earlier but were down slightly from June net of seasonal factors. Single-family home sales increased moderately on a year-over-year basis (to August 2024) in most states but fell slightly in Massachusetts. (No data were available for Connecticut). Contacts in Massachusetts said that summer home sales were muted, even relative to seasonal norms, as prospective buyers waited for mortgage rates to fall further; the same contacts noted that home prices softened for two consecutive months but still increased moderately from a year earlier. Home prices were also up moderately from August 2023 in the other First District states, on average, but the price changes were somewhat mixed across markets. For-sale inventories rose substantially on a year-over-year basis (to August) in every market except Massachusetts, where inventories were flat from one year earlier. Contacts were guardedly optimistic that home sales would improve further in late 2024 and into 2025, based on the likelihood that mortgage rates would fall further during that period.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook202410-boston.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;`)[0];\n",

The supply of homes continued on a slow upward trend but remained near historic lows. Demand remained solid, though it was tempered by buyers’ uncertainty about the path of mortgage rates and home prices. Demand continued to outpace supply, and home prices edged up across the District. Although bidding wars became slightly less frequent, a substantial share of sales closed over the asking price, and cash sales remained an unusually large share of activity. Manhattan remained the exception, where inventory was at normal levels, closings were subdued, and prices moved down slightly.  The rental market eased slightly after an extended period of rising rents. Rents in New York City edged down slightly but remained at high levels. Demand for rental housing was strong, and new signed contracts continued to rise. Outside of New York City, rents edged up after bottoming out earlier in the year, and vacancy rates were slightly above pre-pandemic levels.  Commercial real estate markets weakened. The office market continued to worsen, albeit at a slower pace than last year. Demand for office space continued to decline, and vacancy rates rose across the District. The retraction in the industrial market following the pandemic boom continued. In northern New Jersey in particular, the industrial vacancy rate rose considerably as demand for space sagged.  Construction firms reported that activity continued to decline at a moderate pace. One business owner reported notably elongated construction times due to protracted permitting processes and utility-related delays.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook202410-new-york.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;`)[0];\n",

The inventory of for-sale properties edged slightly higher, but homes continued to sell extremely quickly and for over asking price, according to brokers.

One builder described “malaise” around prospective buyer traffic; however, another contact highlighted that the share of prospective buyers that signed a contract is high compared with the historical average.  In the office market, leasing activity held steady.

New home construction activity increased, with several builders describing “buyers coming off the sidelines” as interest rates have trended down. Declines in mortgage rates in recent months have also affected the market for existing homes, though real estate contacts were mixed on the outcome; one realtor saw more buyers come into the market, while another contact suggested that some potential buyers were continuing to wait for further declines in interest rates. On balance, contacts expected activity to grow at a moderate pace over the months ahead.  Nonresidential construction activity was flat over the last two months. Two commercial builders reported that many companies were planning to wait until after the general election to undertake construction projects. Public construction firms also reported fewer projects in their pipelines. Still, commercial real estate agents reported increased demand for office space as some firms returned to in-person work and others renewed leases after previously postponing such decisions. Collectively, contacts anticipated a moderate increase in demand in the coming months.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook202410-cleveland.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;`)[0];\n",

Despite this, online buyer traffic remained robust, with fewer casual viewers visiting properties in person. An agent in Virginia noted that housing inventory was on the rise, particularly with fixer-uppers and less-than-ideal homes entering the market. Agents across our District continued to mention the continuum of lawsuits and uncertainties with the recent National Association of Realtors policy changes.  Commercial real estate activity has leveled off in the past month. Agents noted a decrease in vacancies in prime A spaces but continued vacancy growth in lower-grade markets. In the industrial sector, there was caution around speculative building but an uptick in owner-user purchases. A few companies in North Carolina noted they were delaying major capital expenses until 2025. This delay was also seen in private construction, according to a residential and metal buildings construction company in Virginia, who noted fewer potential customers and clients finding it more difficultly to afford the work.  While the full extent of the damages from Hurricane Helene remains unclear, the storm caused severe destruction of both commercial properties and housing stock in western North Carolina and Virginia.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook202410-richmond.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;`)[0];\n",

Home sales saw slight to modest declines while inventory levels increased sharply, especially in Florida markets. Even with higher inventories, prices remained near peak levels. Elevated prices, combined with rising taxes, insurance, and HOA costs, offset much of the cost benefits of lower interest rates. As such, affordability remained a concern for potential buyers, incentivizing many to delay purchasing in expectation of future rate declines. Optimism in the new home market improved. However, builders still offered aggressive incentives (i.e., rate buydowns) to attract buyers.  Commercial real estate (CRE) activity across the District declined slightly. Office, industrial and multifamily sectors continued to see rising vacancy rates. Non-bank lenders reported higher levels of delinquencies of office, multifamily, and hotel loans. Increasing CRE loan maturities continued to create challenges for all lender types. Underwriting standards remained tight, making access to loans challenging. A slight uptick in transaction volume was spurred by lower rates; however, uncertain CRE values continued to create sizable headwinds.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook202410-atlanta.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;`)[0];\n",

In the St. Louis area, sales and listings remained stable. In Tennessee, existing inventories of homes for sale have continued to increase and contacts reported that these homes were staying on the market longer. In Arkansas and Northen Mississippi, contacts noted that the residential real estate market had improved over the past month. Contacts across the region reported that the recent decline in interest rates is expected to attract more potential homebuyers, with the concern that it will place upward pressure on property prices, as buyers compete for a limited supply of homes.  Commercial real estate has slightly improved; contacts reported that construction activity was picking up. Developers in Arkansas noted that a project previously on hold had actively moved forward in recent weeks. Many multifamily complexes across the District are under construction, and rental units continue to be in high demand. Contacts also reported industrial construction is expected to remain strong due to demand for data centers and power plants.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook202410-st-louis.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;`)[0];\n",

Industry data suggested that sector activity was growing slightly. But sources suggested that large projects, like data centers and infrastructure, have balanced much slower activity in other segments, particularly multifamily and other commercial projects. A contact from a mid-sized Minnesota construction firm said it was seeing “increased pressure on margins to secure a smaller number of opportunities.” Several contacts reported a small, preliminary uptick in those looking to restart delayed projects given the recent cut in interest rates. Others reported that potential customers and projects were in a “wait and see” mode in relation to the election. Single-family residential permitting increased in September, year over year, in much of the District, with the exception of Minneapolis-St. Paul, which saw a fairly large decline.  Commercial real estate remained soft. Industrial vacancy rates have risen but were expected to fall going forward thanks to a dearth of new building. Office vacancy rates remained high, though new leasing activity in high-quality space was reportedly healthier. Residential housing sales were lower overall and fairly volatile compared with last year’s activity. Available sales figures for August and September showed double-digit declines in some markets, while some markets saw increases of similar size, even in the same state.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook202410-minneapolis.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;`)[0];\n",

Contacts cited steady traffic and sales but noted lack of urgency among buyers and that clients were looking for deals. There were reports of weaker activity in the entry-level market. Discounting and rate buy downs remained widespread, and land and lot prices stayed elevated. The squeeze on builders’ margins tempered outlooks.  Commercial real estate activity was steady.

Single-family home prices were stable to up, while multifamily rents were stable to down as new completions continued to expand supply. A Southern California contact observed that migration out of the area somewhat contributed to higher vacancy rates. Some builders reportedly put new projects on hold in anticipation of lower financing costs over the coming months.  Commercial real estate activity was unchanged on balance. Demand for retail space was solid, and landlords reported being able to fill vacant stores at higher rents. Rents for industrial space were stable, and one contact observed stronger demand for smaller properties. Office vacancies remained elevated as renovation costs reportedly limited landlords’ ability to lower rents further to attract prospective tenants. Commercial construction activity was bolstered by government infrastructure projects, and project backlogs reportedly eased.         &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook202410-san-francisco.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;`)[0];\n",
