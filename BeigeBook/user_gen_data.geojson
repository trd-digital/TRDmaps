But its sectors and subsectors often move in different directions, as the pandemic and post-pandemic years have reminded us.<br><br>\n\nHousing in Gotham is <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2024/02/08/survey-shows-nyc-housing-vacancy-rate-at-1-4-percent/\">infamously tight</a> resulting in high market-rate rents and home prices and less than 1 percent vacancy for rent-stabilized units.

Owners of market-rate multifamily buildings prospered as demand grew more than supply. The seemingly perpetual housing shortage has persisted since a five-year period after the Great Recession when <a href=\"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/1c9138dc24064b2e8142ff156345a719\">production fell to about half</a> of usual levels.<br><br>\n\nTwo years passed between the <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2022/11/11/developers-went-on-permit-palooza-before-421a-expiration/\">expiration of the 421a tax break</a> for multifamily projects and the passage of its replacement, <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2024/04/24/developers-weigh-in-on-new-yorks-485x-tax-break/\">485x</a> a lull that squeezed the supply pipeline.<br><br>\n\nMeanwhile, <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2024/06/17/nyc-rent-guidelines-board-approves-2-75-rent-hike/\">rents at regulated units</a> which make up about half of the city’s rental stock, were outpaced by operating costs as inflation rose, <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2024/04/18/rent-guidelines-board-proposes-4-hike/\"> devaluing those properties</a> — a painful period for owners compounded by the rise in <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/tag/interest-rates/\">interest rates</a> that began in March 2022 and only abated this year.

Such projects — whether planned or underway — are increasingly taking office space off the market, but the sheer amount of square footage available has minimized the effect on rents and vacancy rates.<br><br>\n\nThe retail sector has been a surprise star for the past couple of years, as it turns out people don’t want to do all of their shopping from a screen. Storefront vacancies have been dropping since the Covid shock, and some <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2024/01/22/jeff-sutton-sells-fifth-avenue-building-to-gucci-owner-for-963m/\">megadeals</a> on <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2023/12/26/prada-buys-another-jeff-sutton-fifth-ave-building-for-410m/\">Fifth Avenue</a> have reminded the world of the prestige that luxury retailers attach to New York.

The results can be seen in the <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2024/10/01/hotel-sector-hamstrung-in-new-york-city/\">hotels’ high room rates</a> and occupancy figures, which have also been aided by city contracts to house migrants’ taking some properties off the market.<br><br>\n\nA boom in the <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/tag/industrial-real-estate/\">industrial sector</a> powered by online shopping and internet retailers’ suddenly insatiable thirst for distribution centers, was a bright spot in the years leading up to the pandemic and especially during it. Growing demand for self-storage was a factor as well.<br><br>\n\nBut Amazon scaled back its plans for distribution centers and the industrial real estate surge leveled off, causing project filings for <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2021/11/10/warehouses-in-the-sky-multi-level-projects-ramp-up/\">multi-level warehouses</a> to slow considerably.

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "City": "Chicago, IL", "User Generated Real Estate Summary": "<strong>Housing market</strong><br><br>\n\nHousing prices in the Second City went through a boom during the pandemic, but it just wasn’t as loud as the rest of the nation, as home values grew much more slowly.<br><br>\n\nThat’s no longer the case.<br><br>\n\nHome price growth proved far more resilient in Chicagoland than almost every other metropolitan area as the broader housing market has largely stagnated since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in 2022.<br><br>\n\nLate last year, the Chicago metro area led in home price growth among the 20 major metro areas tracked by the S&P Case-Shiller index, and it’s given up little ground since, coming in ranked second at 6.9 percent year-over-year in average home price increases as of November 2024, with fellow Midwestern market Cleveland just ahead at 7 percent.<br><br>\n\nResidential real estate brokers have long recited the phrases “slow and steady wins the race” along with “our highs aren’t as high and our lows aren’t as lows,” as the mantras for investing in the Windy City. While Chicago-area homeowners may have felt like they were missing out during the pandemic-era jump in prices that were so much bigger elsewhere — putting their pace of growth among the slowest in the U.S. — they’re seeing the benefits now as nationwide deal-volume comes to a practical standstill. There’s been far fewer home purchases per capita than normal across the country as listings for sale remain ultra-low, fueling demand for the few homes that are on the market. And that dynamic is playing out in Chicagoland, too, with prices edging higher at a faster clip than other metros over the past year.<br><br>\n\nBut Chicago’s housing market is complex, and there’s plenty of troubling signs, too, particularly in the luxury segment.<br><br>\n\nThe downtown condo market in 2024 faced several significant challenges. Sellers such as billionaire Ken Griffin have taken significant losses on recent high-end condo deals, locking in drops of value of millions of dollars for some units. Plus, Magellan, the developer of the 101-story condo-hotel St. Regis skyscraper, recently sold 84 luxury units that never drew buyers, in bulk, to the Denver-based investment arm of Grupo Denim. The $117 million price was likely for a fraction of the total value the developer would have sought had it been able to sell the units individually. In fact, 2024 was the first year in recent memory without a major condo development under construction.<br><br>\n\nMarket experts, however, have suggested that the condo market will recover as the city addresses crime and the perception of crime downtown, which was elevated following spots of civil unrest during the pandemic.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Office market</strong><br><br>\n\nLike much of the rest of the office market, Chicago’s is in the doldrums, weighed down by a record-low level of demand from commercial real estate tenants as work-from-home and hybrid work policies linger, cutting the amount of workspace companies need.<br><br>\n\nThe market for many buildings is being driven by their lenders, who are trying to recoup as much as possible on loans that far exceed the value of the properties they’re tied to in a handful of cases. Landlords are often opting to surrender their buildings to their lenders rather than try to fight off a foreclosure lawsuit. In other instances, lenders have had to pursue formal foreclosure actions against borrowers to strip control of offices, including a $372 million dispute over the former IBM Building owned by Beacon Capital Partners at 330 North Wabash Avenue. Office market distress has accelerated since interest rate hikes combined with the effect of remote work to make refinancing untenable.<br><br>\n\nEven years after the pandemic struck, the effect of hybrid work schedules has sent the downtown Chicago office vacancy rate climbing to a record 25.8 percent in the third quarter of 2024. The suburban office market is even worse, with average vacancy exceeding 30 percent.<br><br>\n\nMany companies are downsizing their lease footprints by 15 to 25 percent, or even more, leading to declines in property values and financially troubled assets. Office buyers are finding substantial discounts to what it cost to build similar buildings today, sometimes by buying the loan note tied to a building at a discount from its face value and then seizing the property from the borrower. But buyers have had to commit to investing millions of dollars beyond their purchase price into turning assets around by funding renovations and leasing costs.<br><br>\n\nWhile newly built Class A properties are outperforming older Class B buildings, even owners of trophy assets such as Don Bren’s Irvine Company at 300 North LaSalle Street and Blackstone’s Willis Tower have poured substantial sums into upgrading amenities to stay on top of the market and attract new rental revenues. Landlords are also making significant concessions to tenants — often in the form of cash allowances to build out their workspaces that can be converted into free rent if unused — in order to land new leasing deals.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Multifamily market</strong><br><br>\n\nChicago’s shrinking development pipeline — diminished by high interest rates and expensive materials and labor — is set to push apartment rents up over the next year. So there’s no shortage of demand from tenants in the multifamily market.<br><br>\n\nBut some sellers of Chicagoland apartment complexes are having a hard time finding buyers who can make the math work without taking over properties at big discounts.<br><br>\n\nAn analysis of deals for 27 recent multifamily properties that sold for more than $10 million in the Chicago metro area found 17 sold at a markup from their last sale price. Suburban markets accounted for 11 of the 17 winners in the bunch, with sellers marking up their purchase prices from between $4 million to $10 million. The deals within Chicago’s city limits included six markups and eight that traded for less than prior sales.<br><br>\n\nSuburban Chicago multifamily sales, especially those in the collar counties surrounding Cook County, are outperforming those within the city, driven by a combination of strong rent growth — among the most rapid in the nation, in fact — and political challenges closer to the city. Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi’s increased tax burdens on commercial and multifamily properties have made investors wary of Chicago, where political instability and contentious tax policies exacerbate the market challenges in a higher interest rate environment.<br><br>\n\nSuburban counties, with more predictable tax environments, are attracting more buyers, supported by strong rental demand and competitive rents averaging $2.06 per square foot, a 4 percent annual rise, The Real Deal reported in November 2024.<br><br>\nUrban properties face significant tax-related uncertainties and recent high-profile losses, like JPMorgan’s $60 million downturn on a Lake Shore Drive property, reflecting waning investor confidence.<br><br>\nLimited development opportunities in Chicago due to zoning restrictions and scarcer land contrast with suburban areas, where projects like Bradford Allen’s $130 million Arlington Heights redevelopment plan signal growth potential. Distress in the multifamily market has started to rear its head — Prime Finance filed a $69 million foreclosure suit for a Loop apartment complex owned by a venture of Jonathan Holtzman .<br><br>\nDespite the bumps in the road, market experts predict multifamily investments in both Chicago and its suburbs remain promising due to consistent rent growth and limited new supply.<br><br>\n<strong>Retail market</strong><br><br>\nRetail properties have also seen distress, with a couple notable foreclosures and high-profile losses on building sales reflecting struggles in urban markets. Consumer spending patterns and broader economic pressures have complicated recovery from the pandemic.<br><br>\nNorth Michigan Avenue, known as the Magnificent Mile, continues to grapple with high vacancy. Meanwhile, other pockets of Chicago, such as Oak Street in the Gold Coast — where luxury retailers have concentrated, including by moving off the Mag Mile — are thriving. Furthermore, Fulton Market is developing a more robust retail scene as its office market keeps the crown as the most desirable downtown. And North Side thoroughfares such as the Southport Corridor and Armitage Avenue are commanding strong retail rents, as well.<br><br>\n<strong>Industrial Market</strong><br><br>\nOnce a standout, the industrial real estate sector is now cooling, but only a bit. After record-breaking warehouse development during the pandemic, demand has slowed, leading vacancy rates to creep to nearly 5 percent, up from record lows notched during and just after the pandemic.<br><br>\nDevelopers are pivoting to adapt unused suburban office campuses into industrial uses, though community resistance remains an obstacle in some suburbs. Rent growth in this sector is expected to moderate due to increased supply, a byproduct of developers racing to meet demand for warehousing and logistics space through building a record amount of square footage in the sector over the past two years.<br><br>\n<em>— Chicago Bureau Chief Sam Lounsberry.

The region’s ability to land companies to employ its growing population, meanwhile, has been just as clearly demonstrated in recent year, with the path from California now well worn by corporate relocations across various industries.<br><br>\n\nThe long-term effects of work-from-home trends will likely have less effect in Dallas-Fort Worth than other markets around the U.S. That’s partly due to fact that Texas saw less restrictive policies on gathering during the pandemic.<br><br>It also gets an assist from employers being more willing to call workers back to offices—-AT&T, a major corporate presence in the region, just ramped up its expectations for its DFW workforce.<br><br>\n\nAlso helping push the return to office is the arrival of key office developments in the works to host an influx of the sort of financial firms that have been leaders in the return-to-office trends.<br><br> \n\nGoldman Sachs and Wells Fargo are both developing major office hubs in Dallas, and various other financial firms have been setting up shop in the city, prompting the advent of the <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/magazine/october-2024/wall-to-yall/\">“Y’All Street”</a> nickname.<br><br>\n\nPricing for Dallas office sales seems to be running roughly in the range of $200 to $300 per square foot—about on par with San Francisco these days.<br><br>\n\nOutliers abound, with deals in Fort Worth and various submarkets, Class B properties in general and transactions <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/texas/dallas/2024/05/24/shaya-prager-burnett-plaza-lawsuit/\">steeped in distress</a> going much lower.<br><br>\n\nThe residential markets of the Dallas/Fort Worth area continue on a trajectory of overall growth with hot streaks as slowdowns in reaction to interest rates and employment trends.

But it has at least stabilized its street-level atmosphere, reclaiming a general sense of public order.<br><br>\n\nThat, in turn, has prompted a stirring of interest among office tenants, pushed along by the <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/sanfrancisco/2024/11/18/big-office-tenants-return-to-san-francisco-office-market/\">AI boom</a> that is centered in the city.<br><br>\n\nThe current market, even viewed optimistically, remains both a comedown and a comeuppance for landlords in a city that saw a social media boom fuel a long run of peak demand until the pandemic. For a number of years, the market was tight enough to blur distinctions between Class A and Class B—every social media outfit seems to need any space it could get.<br><br>\n\nThat evaporated when the pandemic put the work-from-home trend on a fast track. Landlords in San Francisco have spent much of the past year or so pouring money into upgrades and amenities and boosting their ground-floor appeal with favorable lease terms for hip coffee shops and restaurants.<br><br>\n\nHopes that such efforts would help tenants get workers back and occupancy levels back on track have seen modest returns. Office workers have begun to show up more often, but Downtown San Francisco is still a long way from its peak. That helps explain why office prices continue to bump along the bottom, in the $200-per-square-foot to $300-per-square foot range.<br><br> \n\nThe market still has a long and grinding road toward a reset that will play out against a new political backdrop in the city, where Daniel Lurie—scion of Levi’s fortune—will take over as mayor after an election that marked another turn toward moderate Democrats after an extended period of momentum for the progressive wing of the party in what is decidedly a one-party city.<br><br>\n\nOther markets across the larger Bay Area are in various states of a reset, with San Jose struggling but a couple of towns at the heart of <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/sanfrancisco/2024/10/23/bay-area-office-sales-increase-even-as-prices-come-down/\">Silicon Valley</a> picking up heat, while <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/sanfrancisco/2024/09/13/kaiser-sells-oakland-office-tower-and-garage-for-14-4m/\">Oakland</a> is still seeking the bottom.<br><br>\n\n\nOn the San Francisco Peninsula, meanwhile, Menlo’s Park’s legendary Sand Hill Road is driving a trend of pricey <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/sanfrancisco/2024/12/16/menlo-park-leads-the-nation-in-high-price-office-rents/\">office rents</a> to supplement the area’s reputation as the tech industry’s financial center.<br><br>\n\nThe Bay Area’s residential markets continue to react to interest rates on the margins, driven more basically by California’s chronic shortages of housing production. San Francisco notched a median home price of around $1.4 million as 2024 neared an end, with Silicon Valley at about $1.5 million, and Oakland at $800,000 or so.<br><br>\n\n<em>— National Managing Editor Jerry Sullivan.

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "City": "Houston, TX", "User Generated Real Estate Summary": "<strong>Houston</strong><br><br>\n\nHouston looks to be in similar shape to most big cities in the U.S., with downtown office vacancy rates of close to 30% and a lot of talk about—and some action on—office-to-residential conversions.<br><br>\n\nMore than a few cases of <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/texas/houston/2024/11/13/notoriously-distressed-houston-office-building-hits-market/\">distress</a> have roiled the market at the same time, with office values dipping below $100 per square foot in some cases.<br><br>\n\nThe city proper also follows a familiar pattern for Sunbelt cities, with decentralization leading to mid- to low-rise office and flex space spread over various districts. The Energy Corridor is an area where various oil and related outfits are concentrated over time, and its vacancy rate is currently closer to 20%—considerably better than Downtown. The outlook gets better in smaller submarkets farther away from the city’s center, with the vacancy rate in the Katy Freeway submarket to the west under 10%.<br><br>\n\nThe decentralized nature of Houston—both the city and its larger metro area stretching to major suburbs such as The Woodlands—also applies to the soft demand for office space. Consider the tower at 3000 Post Oak Boulevard, west of downtown, where the recent <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/texas/houston/2024/09/23/80m-houston-office-loan-transferred-to-special-serving/\">departure</a> of contracting giant Bechtel as the dominant tenant the 440,000-square-foot office that sent it into special servicing.<br><br>\n\nThe current high vacancies and pockets of distress aside, Houston resembles other major markets in Texas—and differs from many big cities on other parts of the U.S.—when it comes to growth.<br><br>\n\nThe city appears destined to continue growing its population for some time. It is currently the fourth-largest city in the U.S., and the fifth-largest metro area, with a population of 7.5 million, trailing only NY, LA, Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth by the regional measure.<br><br>\n\nThe growth stems from a number of factors, including a general bent toward policies that are friendly to business in general, including developers.<br><br>\n\nIt is the city’s role as the seat of the global energy industry that has the biggest effect on the office market. The city is chock full of trading firms that typically take around 30,000 square feet of office space—and they are part of a larger ecosystem of the industry that can service green power as well as fossil fuels.<br><br>\n\nThe city and region’s growth also fuels a residential market that features a high-end with the requisite neighborhoods of mansions and luxury shopping districts in River Oaks, Tanglewood, and other areas. They are now getting punctuated by high-rise luxury condos—a new trend pushed along by remnants of old oil family land holdings and the city’s relative lack of zoning restrictions.<br><br>\n\nFrom the middle down the residential market has been fairly steady, with the median price holding around the mid <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/texas/houston/2024/08/19/houstons-most-expensive-home-sales-trend-to-ultra-luxury/\">$300,000</a> mark, sales down a bit lately, with the average time on market up to six weeks from less than five weeks a year ago, according to recent data from Redfin.\n\n<em>— National Managing Editor Jerry Sullivan.
