			<description>This is where Related Urban, a subsidiary of Jorge PÃ©rez&apos;s Related Group, wants to build a mixed-use apartment and retail project. The City Council is expected to vote on the final proposal in mid-May. The tentative proposal is for roughly 630 apartment units in towers that could go up to eight stories. The majority of the units will be market-rate, although some will be affordably priced. </description>
