That helps Hodari, 38, remain confident about prospects for the company he co-founded in 2012 even after last year’s sudden and dramatic downfall of co-working giant WeWork cast a pall over the entire sector. Hodari said his role has become progressively more outward-facing as Industrious has grown and changed its business model from leasing space to focusing on partnerships and management contracts. And the firm continues to expand — doubling in size annually for the last six years — now boasting locations at 215 Park Avenue South by Union Square and 594 Dean Street in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, plus recently opened spots at 31 Hudson Yards, 325 Hudson Street in Soho and 1411 Broadway by Bryant Park. It also has outposts in 46 other cities, including Miami, Los Angeles and Chicago. That growth has led to several partnerships, including one with Equinox that ultimately led Hodari to start working out for the first time since ninth grade, when a high school soccer coach’s vow never to let him on the field led him to quit sports and exercise for about 22 years. Hodari got married in New Orleans in January with a wedding that featured a karaoke contest, a scavenger hunt and a trivia contest, along with flamenco dancers and a Latin jazz band.",2020,"215 Park Avenue Chicago, IL",Point,"[-87.636645, 41.9106866]"

2121,The Closing: Barry Sternlicht,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/?p=281218"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Barry Sternlicht,</a> who has amassed an estimated net worth of $3 billion over the years, is co-founder, chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group. The investment firm manages more than $60 billion in assets, and Sternlicht is launching a public company focused on special acquisitions that will hold a $600 million IPO in May. Sternlicht is now on the hunt for discounted properties, including distressed hotels. The Brown University and Harvard Business School graduate got his start in real estate investment at JMB Realty. Sternlicht was laid off from the company in 1990, following the market’s collapse, and went on to launch Starwood the next year with his partner at the time, Robert Faith. In one of their first deals, they bought apartments from the Resolution Trust Corporation — which the federal government formed to hold and liquidate properties owned by failed savings and loans in the wake of the S&L crisis. Starwood, which is building its new headquarters in Miami Beach, now employs more than 4,000 people across 16 offices on three continents. Over the past three decades, the company has acquired and developed more than 150 million square feet of office, retail and industrial space, 300,000 hotel rooms and 180,000 multifamily units. Starwood has also invested about $7 billion in energy infrastructure and $230 million in oil and gas. While the company has largely withstood the pandemic so far, Starwood has had to furlough some of its hotel workers. Sternlicht told The Real Deal he’s optimistic the hospitality industry will rebound from the pandemic, but said he’s more skeptical about the future of retail and voiced his many frustrations with Amazon. In a wide-ranging Zoom interview from his home in South Florida, the billionaire CEO also talked about everything from his stance on restarting the economy and his relationship with Donald Trump to his father’s harrowing experience during World War II.",2020,"60 billion in assets, and St Chicago, IL",Point,"[-87.6297982, 41.8781136]"
