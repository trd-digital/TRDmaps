11:17 AM",Factory-made modular homes are coming to Chicago.,"[""7205 South Ridgeland Avenue (Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty)Factory-made modular homes are coming to Chicago.Developer Summer Qwest Holdings completed one modular home in South Shore with plans to build at least two more, Crain’s reported.“It’s faster to build [than conventional construction] and easily repeatable,” Summer Qwest’s Marcus Dailey said. “It’s an innovative way to bring new construction that people can afford into the community.”The modular houses are built in pieces in a factory and assembled onsite, which essentially cuts construction time in half. In addition to the shortened construction timeline, the pre-cut, standardized materials are cheaper for builders, meaning the homes can be offered to buyers at a lower price.The first completed modular home for Summer Qwest is a 1,620-square-foot, three-bedroom at 7205 South Ridgeland Avenue. The home is currently listed for $449,900 by Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty.Dailey plans to build two more modular houses on the remaining vacant lots at the corner of Ridgeland Avenue and 72nd Street, next to the completed home. The lots have been vacant for almost 20 years, public records show.While modular construction is often associated with cheaper homes, it’s also becoming more popular with luxury housing developers. A modular seven-bedroom home with a pool and pool house in Bridgehampton, New York sold for $4.7 million in 2020.Dailey is the first developer to use designs from Archer Heights-based Kinexx Modular Construction for market-rate homes. Kinexx’s designs have previously been used for affordable housing projects, including the Resurrection Project in Back of the Yards, where the homes are listed for $200,000. Kinexx is also working with Structured Development to build modular houses in East Garfield Park as part of two developers’ affordable housing requirements.Overall, Kinexx has delivered seven modular homes for affordable housing projects in the Chicago area. The East Garfield Park project, where four of the units are located, will have two more delivered this week and has a total order for 28 homes.[CCB] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",7205 South Ridgeland Avenue

The banking giant is looking at sites to relocate upwards of 1 million square feet downtown at a time when choice office space is widely available and developers are itching to build.In what could be a record-breaking lease deal, JPMorgan reportedly is looking at a number of sites in vacant buildings as well as at least four potential new developments in the Loop and Fulton Market, according to the Chicago Tribune. If it does relocate from its namesake tower in the heart of the Loop, it has to determine what to do with that 1.9-million-square-foot skyscraper.This isn’t the first time JPMorgan has scouted for sites, but it looks like it could actually make the move this time, the Tribune said. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has been outspoken about bringing workers back to the office, insisting that some departments work five days a week onsite.And he’s upped the ante in New York to do it with a new “universal design” headquarters at 270 Park Avenue that has a flexible reconfiguration. At the same time, he’s told shareholders he intends to “significantly reduce” the company’s office footprint.In Chicago, the bank owns and occupies much of the 60-story Chase Tower that is an imposing part of the city’s skyline. It opened in 1969 and has been updated a few times since, but it’s not the same as the shining new skyscrapers Bank of America is now in at 110 N. Wacker Drive or the BMO Tower under construction next to Union Station.Real estate observers told the Tribune that JPMorgan would not want to let its competitors look better than it does in new towers, suggesting a move was imminent. If not, Chase Tower is likely to get a huge overhaul, the report said.[Chicago Tribune] – Jennifer WatersAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",270 Park Avenue

A spokesperson for Cappleman Tuesday morning declined comment on the latest development.But Hopkins called Sterling Bay’s decision to add the 300 additional affordable units “very persuasive” and predicted the project will win committee approval Thursday.Mayoral candidates Toni Preckwinkle and Lori Lightfoot, meanwhile, have joined those who want delay the approval process until one of them becomes mayor in May. But Hopkins said the project has been debated and revised since July, a process he said has “consumed” his time, and said there is no need to delay the project any longer.“If we’ve earned support, we’re entitled to a vote now,” he said, adding opponents have not offered any concrete reasons for a delay. “They’ve simply been saying ‘delay, delay, delay’ for no other reason than to delay.”In addition to the 600 onsite affordable units, Sterling Bay has promised to develop 300 more affordable units within three miles of the Lincoln Yards site and pay $39 million into a city fund designed to promote affordable housing citywide.Sterling Bay spokesperson Sarah Hamilton issued a statement saying the firm is committed to be inclusive, whether through diversity in hiring and contracting or through affordable housing efforts.“Chicago is our home and we are proud to double the amount of on-site affordable housing at Lincoln Yards as well as contribute additional units and funds to the city’s affordable housing supply,” she said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","600 onsite affordable units, St"

J.B. Pritzker announced on Thursday that Ernst & Young Infrastructure Advisors will lead the effort to sell the center, which is costing the city and taxpayers $17 million a year. The state hopes to identify a potential developer in the spring and sell the 1.2-million-square-foot building in the second half of 2020, according to the Chicago Tribune.Those who are interested in purchasing the 34-year-old building will have to maintain the Clark/Lake CTA station operating in the building. They’d also have to work out the retail lease held by Winthrop Realty Trust, which doesn’t expire until 2034.Pritzker said the money generated by the sale would go toward closing the gap in the state’s underfunded pension system. Gov. Bruce Rauner pushed for the sale during his tenure, and predicted it would bring in $300 million.“The Thompson Center has outlived its useful life in its current state, requiring $17 million a year just to operatie – and it’s time to generate value for the taxpayers from selling the building,” Pritzker said.

The 80-acre site also plans to have a 17-story, 250-unit high-end apartment building by Texas developer Hines Interest. This will replace the 332,000-square-foot space McDonald’s used for office space.The company’s lease comes at a time when the city’s suburban office buildings have taken a hit from the pandemic as tenants are rethinking the future of work-from-home policies.“The timing for this property’s availability couldn’t have been better,” said Jeff Shay, JLL’s executive vice president who represented the owner of the building. “We’re seeing an influx of interest in suburban offices that provide employers with the tools and environment to offer employees a healthy work-life balance.”Suburban vacancy rate rose to 26.5 percent in the third quarter this year, according to JLL. The rate for the East-West Corridor suburban submarket which includes Oak Brook was slightly lower at 22.1 percent.The co-founder of John Paul Mitchell Systems, a conglomerate producing hair care products, John Paul DeJoria, bought the property for $40 million two years ago and rebranded the former McDonald’s campus as Oak Brook Reserve.

A more dramatic decrease of 16.5 percent was recorded in December, according to the Illinois Association of Realtors.The relatively modest sales decreases in February had some hoping that a springtime rebound was in play. Through March, that has not been the case. But with local home prices stalling — and with Chicago and Illinois’ new leadership now in place — buyers might finally be in a position to act.“The data is reflective of a spring where buyers are being deliberate in their spending,” Tommy Choi, broker-owner at Keller Williams Chicago-Lincoln Park and president of the Chicago Association of Realtors, said in a statement. “As the spring selling season ramps up, we’ll start to see more activity again, although at a more measured pace reflective of the current consumer climate.”Chicago has been forecast to have one of the weakest housing markets in the country this year.

The REIT filed for Chapter 11 in June 2021, then reduced its initial $3.5 billion in debts by almost $1 billion and emerged from bankruptcy in October of that year.The adversary case filed last week alleges that the Cook County Assessor’s Office assessed the values of the Lakeview Plaza mall in Orland Park and the Countryside Plaza in Countryside for “far more than the value authorized by Illinois law” based on accepted appraisal methodology for years, going back to the 2016 tax year. Attorneys for Washington Prime didn’t respond to a request for comment. The Cook County Assessor’s Office declined to comment.The Orland Park property was assessed between $30 million and $38 million during the 2016 to 2021 time period, according to numbers provided in the lawsuit. The Countryside property was assessed between $15 million to $19 million.Washington Prime believes it is entitled to refunds of about $2.1 million for Lakeview Plaza taxes and $2.4 million for Countryside Plaza, according to the suit. The firm is also asking the court to determine the market value of the two shopping centers in light of widespread struggles in the mall sector and the deterioration of the properties’ operational performance, per the lawsuit.The mall owner has filed a similar adversary case against Rockaway, NJ, claiming the township unfairly assessed two malls it owns there, Rockaway Commons and Rockaway Town Plaza. In that suit, Washington Prime is claiming it is owed $1.2 million in tax refunds for the two properties, which were assessed from about $16 million to $30 million..Read more\n\n Washington Prime Group files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy \n Washington Prime Group back from bankruptcy; CEO out \n Mall owner Washington Prime Group prepares for bankruptcyAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

An agreement between Northbrook and California’s Panattoni Development dated May 24 shows that village officials authorized Class 6b classification for the property, a step that cuts the property tax assessment for certain qualifying industrial buildings.The agreement stipulates that Panattoni, which entered the Chicago market in 2000 and has a 544 million-square-foot development profile that spans North America and Europe, plans to invest at least $40 million to complete the project. Neither TA Realty nor Panattoni responded to requests from The Real Deal to confirm that they’re developing the property in tandem.The plans come as office vacancies in suburban Chicago climb to a record 27.1 percent, according to JLL. Brokers have embraced a shift from outdated offices that aren’t in prime locations, which is driving up the rate, to industrial uses. The Chicago area’s industrial market has had few vacancies and developers have only recently matched demand.The Northbrook tax incentive is intended to encourage industrial development and is offered for new industrial facilities, rehabilitation of existing industrial structures and reuse of abandoned buildings for industrial use, according to the Cook County assessor’s website.Panattoni intends to demolish the office building and construct a 447,583-square-foot industrial building, according to the public records. It will be customized for an eventual tenant once it’s been leased.According to the document, the property has been vacant and unused for more than two years except for about 30,000 square feet used by Walgreens.

It is the first Global Luxury sales office in Illinois.Rebranding the Gold Coast office under the Global Luxury banner will allow the brokerages to bolster its luxury services in a city that saw a record year for $4-million-plus homes sales in 2018, said Ayoub Rabah, president of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Chicago.“We’re really excited about the global luxury market,” Rabah said. “That’s why we decided to expand our presence in the luxury space. I believe it sets the standard for luxury, and it demonstrates our prominence in the industry.”About 80 agents will work out of the Gold Coast office, and the brokerage is looking to add more, said Doug Fox, branch manager for the office. He said the agents will look to capitalize on the growing residential market Downtown, where buildings like No. 9 Walton, Vista Tower and One Bennett Park are adding hundreds of luxury condominiums.“It’s raising the bar for the number of homes in that price point,” Fox said. “I think it’s a great opportunity.”While other parts of the residential market have had their struggles recently, the luxury market has been strong.At least 70 home sales of $4 million or more were recorded through the first 11 months of 2018. Half were recorded in Chicago, and 20 were recorded in Gold Coast’s No. 9 Walton alone.The number of homes selling at $1 million or higher was up 19 percent through the third quarter of 2018.In targeting the luxury market, the agents in the rebranded Coldwell Banker office will have to compete with one of their former colleagues: Jennifer Ames, one of the highest-performing residential brokers in the Chicago area, this week announced she left the brokerage to launch Chicago’s first outpost for German brokerage Engel & Volkers. Ames said her new venture will continue to target transactions averaging in the $1 million range.Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage, part of New Jersey-based NRT, operates 50 offices in the Chicago area.

The home is a possible teardown, or in need of intense renovations.Annie Challenger, a real estate agent with Baird & Warner who is the listing agent for the house as well as one of the five heirs of James, who died in 2019, and Ruth “Timmie” Challenger, who died in 2008.“Either way you go, it’s a project,” Annie Challenger said to Crain’s. “Either you love the house and want to restore it as a project, or you decide to build your own and it’s still a project.”The home belonged to James Challenger, who in 1966 started an outplacement firm, Challenger Gray & Christmas, with two partners. The house has been in the family since the 1970s.The property also includes a coach house and a greenhouse.A buyer who wants to renovate the existing house “would have to be somebody who’s interested in the beauty of the houses they built back then,” Challenger said to Crain’s.The original owner and architect of the house are unknown. It was owned from 1919 until the late 1960s by the family of William and Alma Hay.The Challengers paid $200,000 for the property in 1970, according to Annie Challenger. That’s equal to about $1.46 million today. Even though the house has been in Annie Challenger’s family for generations, she and her siblings are not anticipating a buyer who wants to restore the home.“We have to be realistic about the condition of the house,” she said.[Crain’s Chicago] — Miranda DavisContact Miranda Davis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n New year, same hot luxury residential market in Chicago \n William Blair leader sells Winnetka home for $6.3M \n Motorola chairman’s son lists Winnetka home for $6.95MAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

08:00 AM","UPDATED, Aug. 10, 2022, 11:45 a.m: Suburban Chicago’s hoteliers are ready to move on from their properties, even when it means cutting a long-sought listing price or taking a loss on their investment.","[""Prominence Hospitality Group’s Rana Rehan Zaid with 2270 Point Blvd and 1251 American Lane (LinkedIn, Kayak)UPDATED, Aug. 10, 2022, 11:45 a.m: Suburban Chicago’s hoteliers are ready to move on from their properties, even when it means cutting a long-sought listing price or taking a loss on their investment.Schaumburg-based BASK Development sold a three-hotel, 262-room portfolio in Chicago’s collar counties this summer for $19.2 million, brokerage Marcus & Millichap said. BASK took a loss of about $150,000 on one of them, a 98-room Elgin Country Inn & Suites at 2270 Point Boulevard.That hotel was valued at $5.85 million, down from the $6 million BASK paid for it in 2019, said Marcus & Millichap broker Ebrahim Valliani, who represented the seller.“They came out with probably a slight loss, but that was a better play for them than doing the renovation and keeping it long term,” Valliani said. Hotel property values are “still making their way” back to pre-pandemic marks, he said.Sellers are increasingly willing to swallow small losses and slash listing prices of assets that have sat on the market. Chicago-area hotel sales rose in the past year, offering owners a window of opportunity to make a deal since volume still lags pre-pandemic norms, according to brokerages.In June, Rana Rehan Zaid’s investment firm, Schaumburg-based Prominence Hospitality,\xa0sold a 206-room Hyatt hotel in Rosemont, at 6350 River Road, for a loss, according to public records that reveal at least $4 million was paid as part of the deal. The hotel last sold in 2017, when Prominence bought it for $11 million. The company wanted to move on from the Hyatt because the brand was outside its focus on limited service hotels, it said when the property was listed.Prominence, which works with and shares an address with BASK, didn’t return a request for comment.The owner of a suburban Hyatt House-branded hotel with 134 rooms at 1251 American Lane in Schaumburg also cut its asking price this summer after marketing the asset for months, to $11.5 million from $13 million. The property, owned by Phoenix-based investor NewGen Worldwide, last fetched $10.5 million in 2018, public records show. It needs a renovation that would cost about $6 million, weighing on its value, Valliani said.“There is demand but it’s at different levels than it was pre-pandemic,” said Andrew Rubin, a Frontline Real Estate Partners broker who’s marketing the 155-room Aloft Hotel in suburban Bolingbrook. That property went into receivership after its owner, Virginia Beach-based LTD, stopped making loan payments on a $14.2 million mortgage that it received just prior to Covid.While the Aloft listing doesn’t include a price, Rubin said sellers making deals at this stage of the recovery tend to be motivated. The price cuts are “factoring in the adjusted risk and the state of the world right now,” he said.“There is still a long path for a lot of this stuff,” Rubin said. “A lot of these were hit hard and are going to have a difficult time recovering.”Distressed hotels are also roiling downtown Chicago. The Hotel Felix in River North is heading for the auction block after its owners, Oxford Capital Group and Gettys Group, defaulted on $70 million in debt tied to the property. Palmer House, the city’s second-largest hotel, was hit with a foreclosure judgment earlier this summer. In addition, the 610-room JW Marriott in the Loop was bought at auction after its Orlando-based owner, Estein USA, defaulted on a $204 million loan.In addition to the risk presented by Covid, there are fewer buyers chasing downtown’s larger, pricier hotels because of this year’s spike in borrowing costs, an effect of federal policymakers working to tamp down inflation.Investment sales in 2022 have valued Chicago-area hotel rooms at about $130,000 each through May, down from about $180,000 in 2019, according to a Marcus & Millichap report. After a surge that started this summer, average daily rates are up almost 25 percent compared with last year and may hit $151 by the end of the year — $5 more than the pre-pandemic average, the brokerage said in a report.While sellers are adjusting their pricing in order to make deals, there’s still money to be made. That’s especially true for assets outside Cook County, reflecting lower taxes and a relative lack of supply.“There are less buyers out there, but if things are priced appropriately, there is still capital out there,” Frontline’s Matt Tarshis said, adding his brokerage hasn’t experienced a slowdown in deal volume this year. Likewise, Valliani said his three-person team this year is on track to surpass its record number of closed hotel deals in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan set at 28 in 2019.The other two hotels that Valliani sold for BASK were the 86-room Holiday Inn Express in Algonquin, which fetched $6.9 million after last being sold for about $5 million in 2010 and renovated for an undisclosed cost. He also helped the firm sell a 78-room Comfort Suites, at 2480 Bushwood Drive in Elgin, for $6.45 million as part of the portfolio sale. BASK developed the property in 2006.Wisconsin-based investor Nilkanth Hotels bought the Comfort Suites and Holiday Inn Express, and a local investor bought the Country Inn and Suites in a 1031 exchange, Marcus & Millichap said. Attempts to reach the buyers for comment weren’t successful.Schaumburg, Elgin and Algonquin are all within Chicago’s northwest suburban submarket, which Marcus & Millichap called an area “where investors are ramping up activity, following an increase of more than 100 percent in hotelier revenues” from earlier in the pandemic.Valliani said his team persuaded BASK that it was getting a fair price, based on the recovery from Covid. These days, “you either sell and unload or hold onto them for another five to seven years.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misidentified the name of BASK and had an incorrect number for the loss in the second paragraph.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2270 Point Blvd

A buyer may not exist,“It’s a tough sell. There’s a lot of work that would have to be done to make it your own.”,"Oct.October 17, 2019
03:00 PM","As his massive compound in Chicago’s northern suburbs collects dust, Michael Jordan is now trying to part with another sprawling mansion.","[""Michael Jordan and an aerial view of his Highland Park property (Credit: Getty Images)As his massive compound in Chicago’s northern suburbs collects dust, Michael Jordan is now trying to part with another sprawling mansion.On Monday, His Airness listed a 10,000-square-foot mountain hideaway in the ritzy ski city of Park City, Utah. But the Park City home, for which he paid $7.9 million, already looks a good bet to sell before the Highland Park property he’s been trying to sell since Barack Obama’s first term in office.The mountain retreat, built in 2006, has five bedrooms and eight bathrooms, with waterfalls on the property and dramatic mountain views. It’s priced at $7.5 million — cheaper than some neighboring mansions — and, though luxurious, lacks the extreme personal touches that define Jordan’s gargantuan Illinois compound. You won’t find a “23” welded onto the front gate or multiple basketball courts on the premises. Judging by the listing photos, you wouldn’t even know it was his.It’s a very different story in Highland Park. The basketball great first listed the home in 2012 at $29 million, and has since slashed the price to $14.85 million. But even after four price drops, a failed auction and unsuccessful marketing tricks over the years, the property remains unsold and faces significant selling challenges, including a sagging suburban luxury market.(Credit: Zillow)One key reason the home has failed to sell is the intense level of customization, brokers said.“It’s clearly his home,” said Bruce Bowers of Bowers Realty Group. “It’s a tough sell. There’s a lot of work that would have to be done to make it your own.”Gail Lissner, a managing director at Integra Realty Resources, said that while she couldn’t opine on the value of the property, comps are limited, especially in the home’s immediate neighborhood. “Any time you have these homes that are just kind of gross over-improvements for the area they do lead to very, very lengthy marketing times,” she said. “It’s located in an area that is much more modest.”(Credit: Zillow)Homes at this price point are often situated along Lake Michigan — a couple miles from Jordan’s former home, she said. And there is not a robust market for such expensive properties in general. The home’s closest competition in Highland Park is a $9.75 million home on Crescent Court. It’s about a third of the size of the Jordan estate, sits directly on Lake Michigan and boasts a private beach. Bowers Realty Group reported the average median Highland Park for 2019 was $520,794 as of September. This is down from an estimated home price of $672,000 in 2018, according to Coldwell Banker.Jordan, who has an estimated net worth of almost $2 billion, moved into the Highland Park estate with his wife and three children in 1995, but said goodbye to the property after getting divorced in 2006. Compass’ Katherine Malkin, who has had the listing since 2012, declined to comment for this article.Jordan doesn’t have history on his side. Lissner said the MLS shows just one detached, single-family home that sold for more than $14 million in the Chicago metropolitan area since 2007: a Lake Bluff home listed at $25 million that sold for $16 million. When expanding that search for homes sold above $7.5 million, only 26 popped up.Other homes of similar sizes currently on the market vary in price. In Winnetka, a 27,000-square-foot home with six beds and 10 baths is listed at $9.5 million. It’s been on the market 175 days. A 30,000-square-foot, eight-bedroom, 14-bathroom Barrington home is listed at $18.88 million. It’s spent almost five years on the market.(Credit: Zillow)When homes sit on the market unmoved, like the Jordan property, a stigma sometimes develops around them, even if unfounded. “[Buyers ask] ‘Why has it been on the market for so long? What’s wrong with it?’,” Bowers said.Janet Borden of Coldwell Banker Homes suggested that at this point, the seller should be marketing to the brokerage community and looking to international buyers or targeted marketing towards sports enthusiasts using different social media and online tools.It’s a strategy that’s not too far off one used in 2015. That year, The Agency, a Los Angeles-based real estate brokerage firm focused on selling celebrity home, tried its luck selling Jordan compound. It offered a pair of each version of Air Jordan sneakers with the house and switched the listing price so that the numbers, when added up, reflected Jordan’s now-retired Bulls jersey number: 23. The gimmicks didn’t take, and it continued to languish on the market.Even with a unique property, the home must fit the local market, brokers said.“It’s pretty normal to have a longer than average market time on something like that because there aren’t that many buyers in the world that can buy it,” said Borden, who has toured the home. “The hard part is after a long, long period of market time, really what they should be looking at is price.”Lissner agreed. There is a buyer for every house — at the right price point, she said. What that price point is for Jordan’s home remains to be seen.Even without his Highland Park and Utah homes on the market, Jordan still has two properties where he can spend his time. He moved into his South Florida home after spending two years and $7.6 million dollars constructing a house on the three acres he bought for $4.8 million. The 28,000-square-foot, 11-bedroom house sits in the Bear’s Club community, an exclusive residential and golf club founded by golf great Jack Nicklaus. He also purchased a 12,000-square-foot, six-bedroom home in the Charlotte, North Carolina area in 2013 for $2.8 million. At that time, he had recently purchased the Charlotte Bobcats NBA team, now the Charlotte Hornets.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Some 31 percent of respondents to a national JLL survey this spring favored them over alternatives. That portion of respondents was the largest of those who indicated the senior housing assets they viewed with the best outlooks.Senior housing isn’t entirely recession-proof, though. Demand for such properties was softened by Covid-19, which dampened interest in congregate care facilities where the virus spread easily among high concentrations of hosts especially vulnerable to severe symptoms. Those concerns were less acute for active adult communities than senior communities offering more intensive health care regimens, and all asset types within the category have since started to rebound.“The pandemic turned this resilience on its head, but demand has since shown improvement on a quarterly basis, with occupancy continuing its steady climb back to pre-pandemic levels,” the JLL report said.Bender focuses on multifamily acquisitions between $5 million and $30 million of class B and C properties built 20 to 40 years ago that contain more than 100 units in the Midwest, according to the firm’s website. Burbank Manor, at 97 Pinehurst Court in suburban Burbank, consists of one- and two-bedroom units in 27 single-story buildings across six acres, and was built in 1983.The company last year stepped above its normal price range to pick up the 672-unit New Colonies apartment community in suburban Steger for almost $70 million.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

But for one city GM is leaving, the pain is even more severe.That’s because GM leveled a full neighborhood in suburban Detroit to build a then-state-of-the-art plant that was to build the Chevrolet Volt hybrid among other products. About 465 acres were cleared in the 1980s to make way for the plant, including 1,500 homes, 140 business, a hospital and six churches, according to Reuters. More than 4,000 people lost their homes.GM has not definitively said the Hamtramck plant will be closed, but it acknowledged the facility will have no products to build after 2019 when GM pulls the Volt from production. The decision is leaving residents and local officials angry that they lost their neighborhood for a plant that’s likely to be closed.“Now that the plant is going to close, people will wonder why that neighborhood had to be sacrificed in the first place,” Hamtramck Mayor Karen Majewski told Reuters.The Michigan Supreme Court in 1981 approved the use of eminent domain to acquire the properties needed for the plant, but in 2004 the court reversed its precedent, calling the earlier ruling a “radical departure from fundamental constitutional principles,” according to Reuters.Massive plants like GM’s in Hamtramck not only provide local jobs but help to buoy the local housing market, similar to how Ford’s auto plant in Chicago keeps South Side neighborhood Hegewisch afloat. The South Side plant helped lure Missouri-based Northpoint Development to build a 2.2-million-square-foot industrial complex next to the auto plant.

We added details on a few of them at the bottom of this story.UPDATE, Aug. 15, 12:15 p.m.: A 7-foot-tall Chicago Bull, a candy company magnate and the richest man in Illinois walk into the lobby of a luxury Chicago condo tower.If you’re waiting for a punchline, don’t. There’s no joke here — just the possibility of what could happen once Omer Asik, Todd Siwak and Ken Griffin all have moved in to their units in the still-under-construction high-rise from JDL Development at 9 West Walton Street in the Gold Coast. The 38-story building was scheduled to open later this year.The roster of soon-to-be residents at No. 9 Walton already includes hedge-fund managers, financial advisers, real estate execs, doctors, lawyers and other wealthy buyers who gave the building the record for most sales of $3 million or more, according to Crain’s.And while it’s true there are many Gold Coast buildings boasting well-heeled leaders of Chicago industry living in multimillion-dollar homes, No. 9 Walton has dominated the list of most expensive residential sales in recent months.In addition to the usual luxury amenities, the building also features a house car and driver, private wine storage available, a covered dog run and two guest suites available to all homeowners. And Gemini restaurant owner Ryan O’Donnell is opening a new two-floor restaurant inside the building, Eater reported. A spokesperson for the Walton Street Kitchen + Bar said it will be led by executive chef Jon Keeley.A JDL executive declined to comment for this article, citing the privacy of the firm’s buyers.The unit prices were determined using information in documents filed with the Cook County Recorder of Deeds. While a number of the units were purchased through trusts or LLC, The Real Deal was able to determine the identities of a number of the buyers:Ken GriffinThe hedge fund billionaire behind Citadel made a splash late last year when he bought four unfinished floors at the top of the building for $59 million, shattering the record for most expensive home sale ever in Chicago. And even with the millions he’d have to spend to build out the home, it wouldn’t come close to the price tag of Griffin’s sprawling South Florida compound.Todd SiwakThe Ferrara Candy Company CEO paid $4.6 million for a three-bedroom unit on the 17th floor. Siwak has led the Oakbrook Terrace-based firm since 2013 and plans to use the condo as a second residence, according to the ChicagoTribune. He also has a home in the St. Louis area.Jason HeywardThe Cubs outfielder bought a 19th-floor unit for $6.9 million through an LLC. But the 29-year-old shouldn’t have many problems making his payments: He’s in the middle of an eight-year, $184 million contract with the Cubs.Matthew LawtonThe executive managing director of commercial real estate firm HFF paid $4.5 million for an 8th-floor condo.Steven and Sarah StrattonJLL’s Steven Stratton is the firm’s Chicago tenant representation group co-lead and oversees its Midwest practice. He and his wife, Sarah, paid $3.8 million for the 10th-floor unit.Omer AsikThe 7-footer from Turkey who is in his second stint with the Bulls paid $3.1 million for a seventh-floor condo with Wilma Wyngaart.Ashley and Jennifer KellerAshley Keller is a co-founder of Keller Lenkner, a plaintiff-side litigation firm. He also was a co-founder of litigation finance firm GKC, which sold in 2016 for $160 million. The Kellers paid $4.8 million for their 20th-floor condo.Stephen Madry and Valerie VlahosMadry, a plastic surgeon, and Vlahos, a director at PriceWaterhouseCooper, paid $5.5 million for their 16th-floor condo.Dominick and Cynthia MondiThe president of Mesirow Financial and his wife paid $2.5 million for their fourth-floor unit.Imad Bazzi and Salma ShawwafBazzi is CEO of Oakbrook Terrace-based ACH Food Companies, a manufacturer of cooking and baking ingredients. They paid $3.2 million for their ninth-floor condo.Joseph RotterThe former Citadel hedge fund manager is managing director for Neuberger Berman Investment Advisers and head of the Principal Strategies Group. He paid $3.6 million for his fourth-floor condo.David and Laura EikenmeyerThe couple behind the Urban Child Academy preschools paid $5.3 million for their 19th-floor unitKevin and Shoshana VernickShoshana Vernick is managing director at investment bank Sterling Partners, while Kevin Vernick is president of commercial real estate firm Vernick & Associates.

Cohen’s online bio says she is creator of ChicagoCondoFinder.com.This story has been updated to correct the purchase price of the Ashley and Jennifer Keller’s condominium. It also has been updated to remove an item that misidentified the buyer of a 34th-floor condo. That unit was actually purchased by a trust.Among the notable sales at No. 9 Walton since this story published were Chicago Blackhawks star Jonathan Toews’ purchase of a unit for $6.3 million.Also, noted personal injury attorney Flip Corboy bought a 24th-floor unit for $6.1 million, and Sara Lurie, daughter of philanthropist Ann Lurie and late real estate executive Bob Lurie, paid more than $5.7 million for a four-bedroom condo.

It refinanced the 1.75 million-square-foot office tower earlier this year with a $678 million loan from JPMorgan and Brookfield Asset Management.Company leaders predicted the additions could pull an additional 2 million tourists each year to the tower at 200 East Randolph Street. Downtown property managers are increasingly reaching for ways to capitalize on the city’s record-smashing tourism.In March, the Kemper Corporation moved its headquarters to the Aon Center with a 65,000-square-foot lease.

In 2006, the building converted to condo with a mix of studios and one-bedrooms, according to a press release.H.A. Langer & Associates already owns about 130 of the 250 units in the building, and is now looking to sell the whole building to a developer, according to Crain’s.Langer owned the entire building until 2005, when it sold the units to a condo converter.The firm then paid about $108,000 per unit when it bought 100 condos in the building in 2016. It has since acquired about 30 more units.Now the plan is to go full circle and sell the entire building to a developer.Kiser Group’s Lee Kiser, Michael DAgostino, Jake Parker and Ken Naslund will represent the building’s condo board in the search for a buyer. Kiser told Crain’s he expects the building to sell for about $40 million, which pencils out to $160,000 per unit.Condo deconversions have become increasingly common in some downtown neighborhoods and on the North Side in the last 15 years or so.Developers looking to address the market of those who don’t want to commit to a purchase — or can’t afford to buy a home — have actively been looking for more rental inventory.

He bought the building from New York-based The Family Office, which paid $18 million for the property in 2016 — meaning Rissman paid a 77 percent increase over the previous sale price.USAA Life Insurance Company provided a $21.5 million acquisition loan for the purchase, records show.Rissman founded Tiger Electronics, which produced the animatronic toy known as the Furby and keychain game known as Giga Pets, among other products. He sold the company to North Shore-based Hasbro for $335 million in 1998.Rissman went on to open Leo Capital Holdings, an investment firm whose office address is the same as the one listed on the LLC used to buy the Evanston office complex. Leo Capital Holdings makes early investments in private tech companies, according to its website. Rissman did not immediately return a call seeking comment.This isn’t Rissman’s first foray into real estate investment.Earlier this year, Rissman paid $43 million for the building at 200 North Green Street in Fulton Market, which is anchored by a 77,000-square-foot WeWork.He has invested heavily in the booming Near West Side neighborhoods, including paying $45 million for a six-story office building at 210 North Green Street in 2017 and buying a nine-story office building at 600 West Fulton Market for $32.2 million in 2007, according to Crain’s.In 2017, Rissman bought the office tower at 150 North Wacker Drive for $75 million, Crain’s reported at the time.The 10-story office building Rissman bought in Evanston was built in 1978 and underwent a renovation in 2006. The property also has a parking garage.Nearby, R2 Companies and T2 Investments are working to develop a 13-story office tower in Downtown Evanston.In November, Evanston voters approved a measure to raise the city’s real estate transfer tax of properties sales above $1.5 million.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",500 Davis Street

09:43 AM","Residents are flocking back to Chicago’s Loop neighborhood, an area in the heart of the city’s downtown left deserted during the height of the pandemic.","[""(iStock/Illustration by Steven Dilakian for The Real Deal)Residents are flocking back to Chicago’s Loop neighborhood, an area in the heart of the city’s downtown left deserted during the height of the pandemic.Leasing and sales activity, which started rising last year, is surging now that workers are returning to their offices and first-time buyers once again feel comfortable living downtown, and prices are rising accordingly.“Demand is explosive,” said Ben Creamer, co-founder and designated managing broker at Downtown Realty Company. “It feels like a busy spring market right now.”Creamer said the average price for a studio apartment in the Loop is $1,769, up from $1,434 a year ago. Downtown Realty reports a 95 percent increase in attached-home sales, mostly condos, last year. The company is currently under contract for $10.4 million on behalf of its clients, with 81 percent of that volume occurring in the last three weeks.“I think demand will continue as more and more people come back to the office,” he said. “We’ve continued to see people reaching out saying ‘I’m coming back into the office and looking to move closer to the downtown area.’”The skyrocketing demand and rising prices represent a return to normalcy for one of the city’s ritziest neighborhoods, which prior to the pandemic bustled with everyone from office workers, and shoppers on State Street during the day to theater and concert-goers at night. But the neighborhood’s tightly packed venues and skyscrapers turned into a liability as the coronavirus tore its way through the country and soon the downtown streets were empty. Those streets are starting to fill up now that vaccines and booster shots make living with the coronavirus manageable, as are apartments and condos.“This year is going to be the year of the condo,” said Matt Laricy, managing broker at The Matt Laricy Group.While Laricy’s firm hasn’t had the same increase in sales as Downtown Realty, he said showings are up 50 percent.Laricy said first time buyers are the primary driving factor between the increase in sales he’s noticed in the neighborhood. Out of state buyers and empty nesters are also returning to the area after a two year hiatus.“A lot of first time buyers moved out of state and when they came back, they were still a little nervous, so they rented,” he said. “With rents being through the roof it’s pushing them to become buyers.”Much of the neighborhood’s new inventory won’t be available until next year, so there will be little relief for renters this year as the Loop continues its recovery, Creamer said.“Typically with the rental market March through September is the busy time,” he said. “Chicago is a very seasonal market and I think we’ll continue to see rents rise through spring and summer.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Now its operator, Evanston-based nonprofit Connections for the Homeless, plans to hold at least a dozen meetings where those who live within a half-mile of the building can voice their concerns.While the shelter has supporters, some residents say people who stay there have been causing problems, including an increase in crime. Police who attended a Human Services Committee meeting in July said they’ve been called to the shelter on multiple occasions and once arrested a resident, who was removed and not allowed to return.Connections Executive Director Betty Bogg said many shelter residents who have gone through trauma and violence seek it out for support to find a permanent home. “The Margarita gives people a chance to catch their breath and organize their lives in a supportive environment and eventually move to a stable living arrangement,” she told the outlet.The group’s main goal is to buy the building. Its owner has more than $400,000 in unpaid taxes on it and needs to sell.John Cleave, 61, who lives three buildings away, told the publication that shelter residents loiter on the streets. Cleave also said some more serious incidents occurred, although he wasn’t comfortable going into detail.“We would like to see less problems,” Cleave told the outlet. “We want to make sure security is there and that the organization is doing its job: finding residents permanent housing.”— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1566 Oak Avenue

They added an 8,000-square-foot building that includes a music studio, kitchen and two bedrooms, listing agent Andra O’Neill of @properties said.The mansion has seven bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and at least 400 feet of Lake Michigan frontage, O’Neill said. It originally was designed by architect David Alder for an heir to the Armour & Company meatpacking fortune.Suburban native Marx had four platinum albums in the 1980s and 1990s, with hits like “Should’ve Known Better” and “Right Here Waiting.” He won a Grammy in 2004 with Luther Vandross for writing the crooner’s hit, “Dance With My Father.”Rhodes’ roles included parts in “Flashdance,” “Staying Alive” and “Dirty Dancing.” The couple divorced in 2014, and Marx married actress Daisy Fuentes the next year.Even though the Chicago area luxury market has been robust, there still are some languishing listings, including several on the North Shore.

Architecture firm Booth Hansen designed the project with plans to bring a new 5,000-square-foot worship space in addition to the condos.The condo units will be priced between $1 million to $2 million. Mark Ordower, the president of Ogden Partners, said the units could also become rentals depending on the financing options.The building is unique because despite being constructed in 1901 it does not have landmark status. The city can place landmark status on buildings without owner consent with the exception of buildings owned by religious organizations. So the congregation kept ownership to prevent the city from landmarking the site and making redevelopment plans more difficult.Groundbreaking is set to begin next spring.

The deal will raise an additional $300 million for Bally’s to develop the $1.74 billion casino project.“It’s just another step forward in making sure that the project is fully funded,” Bally’s chairman Soo Kim told the publication Monday.Earlier this month, Bally’s said it planned to sell the land and lease it back in an effort to raise money to build the new casino project. The 99-year ground lease with Oak Street has 10 options to renew the lease by 20 years each. The lease is expected to generate about 8.5 percent in annual capitalization for Oak Street.Bally’s CFO Bobby Lavan said the new partnership will provide more liquidity for the casino project without Bally’s having to borrow from other capital markets.Oak Street Capital specializes in sale-leasebacks and has more than $18 billion of assets under its management. Last year, New York-based Blue Owl Capital bought Oak Street for $950 million.Bally’s operates other casinos on land it has lease-back agreements for.

Kroger has unveiled the system in 92 of its stores.In the new system, customers add their grocery list to their Kroger app, and digital displays installed in the store’s aisles flash with a customer-chosen icon to direct them to the products they’re shopping for.The digital displays can show ads and sales papers, and Microsoft’s artificial intelligence can predict a shopper’s age and gender, which helps customize the ads to specific customers.Kroger’s smart shelves also can speed up the time for employees to fulfill online orders and curbside pickups, a move that could help gain an advantage over competitors like Amazon’s Whole Foods and Walmart.After acquiring Whole Foods for $13 billion in 2017, Amazon is planning an expansion of the now tech-infused grocer. The new stores will be bigger, with extra space for Amazon’s delivery service and online order pickup. Amazon is also working to roll out 3,000 cashier-free convenience stores throughout the country.Grocers have not been immune to the challenges facing the retail industry. Competition is up, while same-store sales have been flat.

07:06 PM","Chicago investment firm Morningside USA profited on the sale, for $23 million, of the Stewart School Lofts apartments after buying the Uptown property in a controversial 2015 deal.","[""David Strosberg and Stewart School Lofts (Morningside USA)Chicago investment firm Morningside USA profited on the sale, for $23 million, of the Stewart School Lofts apartments after buying the Uptown property in a controversial 2015 deal.Chicago Public Schools caused a stir in the neighborhood when it closed the Stewart School at 4525 North Kenmore Avenue and 48 other school buildings in 2013, when Stewart had just 17 eighth graders in its graduating class.As Morningside swooped in to buy it for $5.1 million in 2015, its plans to redevelop the property were considered a symbol of neighborhood reckoning and gentrification in local headlines.The firm came out ahead after rehabbing the property to the tune of $11.6 million, according to an analysis of Chicago building permits issued for the property between 2016 and 2018. It transformed the school into 64 apartments that opened in 2018 with rents ranging between $1,655 a month for a 565-square-foot studio to $3,955 for a 1,745-square-foot three-bedroom.The property features vintage aspects from its days as a school, like arches and ornate ceiling details in the four apartments carved out of the former auditorium, blackboards on the walls of some apartments and numbered classroom doors in others.Morningside declined to comment on the sale.The deal implied a value of more than $363,000 per unit at the Stewart School Lofts, edging the $332,600 per unit implied by Chicago’s priciest multifamily sale so far this year at the 30-story Astoria Tower luxury apartment building in the South Loop.In that deal, a local investor, Rosemont-based 3L Real Estate, paid $67.5 million to Miami-based Crescent Heights for the building on the property while splitting the land from the rest of the real estate that valued the ground leasehold at $15 million, accounting for the full $82.5 million valuation.The buyer in the Stewart School deal was Stewart School Lofts LLC, an entity registered in Delaware whose owner could not be immediately identified. A Chicago attorney reached by The Real Deal who represented the buyer on the closing did not identify her client.The buyer financed its purchase with a $15.3 million mortgage, with Walker & Dunlop as the lender, public records show.Morningside still owns dozens of other multifamily assets, most of them in the Chicago area, with several in Michigan and Texas, as well.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","23 million, of the St"

A federal judge is now considering whether to approve the landmark settlement, according to the Chicago Tribune.Under the settlement, the CHA will be required to complete a number of mixed-income developments it has planned as well as strengthen its voucher program to allow recipients to rent throughout the city. The CHA would have to meet these goals by 2024, at which point the lawsuit will officially close.The settlement could have wide-ranging impacts on Chicago’s affordable housing offerings. Some of the developments that will need to be completed in that timeline are Related Midwest’s Lathrop Homes and the ABLA Homes redevelopment in University Village.Brought by community activist Dorothy Gautreaux in 1966, the lawsuit was filed when the civil rights movement sought better and more fair housing for minorities. The litigation was instrumental in the city moving away from the practice of building high rise public housing, like the Cabrini Green site on the Near North Side, according to the Tribune.More recently, the city has moved to a mixed-use method of developing CHA housing units, including partnering with the Chicago Public Library to build units on top of new libraries, like Related Midwest is doing on the Near West Side.

The six-time NBA Champion chose the final asking price because the numbers add up to his uniform number of 23.While Jordan hasn’t budged on the price since 2015, Katherine Malkin of Compass told the Tribune that the property has been drawing interest recently.“I’m not sure if it’s because of the TV programs that they did or if it’s because people have an interest in looking at it a little bit differently, but suddenly there does appear to be a bit of interest in it,” she said.Netflix last year aired a documentary miniseries about Jordan and the 1990s Chicago Bulls called “The Last Dance,” which once again thrust His Airness into the public eye.Malkin said the contemporary style mansion, built at the height of Jordan’s fame in 1995, has struggled to sell in-part because the Hall of Famer doesn’t want to put on open houses due to privacy concerns.The seven-acre estate has 15 full bathrooms, four half-bathrooms, a basketball court, an infinity pool and a cigar room. The house has 56,000-square-feet of living space including the basement and 15-car garage. It also has a tennis court and a putting green.The home went up for auction in 2013 but the winning bidders never materialized, the Tribune reported. It had a property tax bill of $132,014 for the 2020 tax year. It’s cost Jordan $1 million in taxes since he bought it.Jordan, a billionaire who has homes in Florida and North Carolina, sold a property in Park City, Utah, to a buyer from Seattle for an undisclosed price in December 2020 after the home was listed for $7.5 million.[Chicago Tribune] — Harrison ConneryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Berkley, according to Crain’s. Also inking leases were Live Nation/Ticketmaster, Collins Engineers and electronic payment company Verifone.The new leasing activity signals a turnaround for a building that had performed poorly since 601W acquired it just before the recession.601W bought the 18-story, 407,000 square-foot building for $125 million in 2005, according to Crain’s. The firm refinanced the property with a $97.5 million loan in 2007, but the economic recession and slow leasing activity helped send the loan into receivership.Early last year, 601W took out a new, $87.7 million mortgage on the property, with plans for a $12.5 million renovation.With the new tenants, the building is now 85 percent leased, up from 61 percent in July, according to Crain’s.The building sits in an area of the Loop that’s seeing a resurgence of office leasing and development. That includes 601W’s overhaul of the massive Old Main Post Office nearby, and Blackstone’s $668 million upgrade of the Willis Tower.

He designed the hilltop home with an octagonal living room, interior columns that taper at the bottom, Arizona limestone floors and a long zigzagging glass wall.Lloyd Wright only designed two buildings in his home state of Illinois, making the house a piece of history. The other building he designed was the Good Shepherd Community Church. He and his son completed the church in 1961 and it was bought by Maine Township in 1983 to house the township’s offices.The Kropps sold the Grayslake home to animal trainer and philanthropist John Cuneo Jr. in the 1970s. Cuneo reportedly kept bison, peacocks and other animals on the property during his time there. He sold most of the land to the Lake County Forest Preserve District in 2016 for about $10.5 million.The home features an indoor gun range, interior and exterior waterfalls, as well as an attached greenhouse. There is also a detached five-car garage set above a 2-bedroom guest house.

Savills broker Eric Feinberg.One of the Chicago suburbs’ biggest commercial sites is up for grabs, but the real question is whether a buyer will emerge by self-imposed deadline day.Pharmaceutical manufacturer Takeda wants to sell its 70-acre Deerfield headquarters by April, the end of the fiscal year, according to the Chicago Tribune. The site comes with 660,000 square feet of existing buildings, plus the potential for a few additional structures totaling 735,000 square feet.Savills broker Eric Feinberg, who won the assignment, told the Tribune that if Takeda’s campus were developed today, it would cost over $400 a foot — $264 million. The pharma company would prefer to sell the whole campus to one buyer — either a developer with a prospective tenant, or a corporation.There are reasons to believe it could appeal to a corporation with ready-made plans. Pharmaceutical firm AbbVie set the standard with the $154 million buy of its 560,000-square-foot Mettawa campus in August 2018.Still, Takeda’s plan to sell the campus comes amid a backdrop of tough economics. Other large firms are moving jobs out of the northern suburbs into the Downtown Chicago area, and Lake County has one of the highest office vacancy rates in the suburbs, according to the Tribune.

Founded in 2008, New Western has bought more than 40,000 homes and says it’s the largest private source of investment properties in the country.An average property for New Western is about 60 years old and costs about $232,000. More than 16 million homes are vacant across the nation, according to a LendingTree analysis.“There is a disconnection in Chicago between what investors need and the properties that are available,” General Manager Richard Randall said in the statement. “Our business model works incredibly well in this environment.”The company’s expansion also includes a new office in Washington D.C. and additional offices in some of the areas the company already serves, according to the Dallas Morning News.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

A potential deal was nearly finalized eight years ago, but ultimately fell through due to cost concerns related to asbestos removal, demolition and the need to build a sea wall.The Silos may look familiar to fans of sci-fi action films. The site was used in Michael Bay’s 2014 film “Transformers: Age of Extinction.”Mike Senner, Executive Vice President at Colliers International told the Chicago Tribune that demand for the property should be high due to the market’s shrinking industrial inventory.The state agrees, which is why it is looking to move the property in earnest.“The sale of this surplus property will generate significant economic opportunities in Chicago’s Lower West Side and McKinley Park communities,” Anthony Pascente, acting director of the state’s Central Management Services, said in a statement.Finding a buyer for the Damen Silos is in line with Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s broader plan to sell off properties in the state’s real estate portfolio that are either too old or too expensive to maintain.It already unloaded a similar property when Google bought the James R. Thompson Center for $105 million earlier this summer. Officials said they estimate that sale will save taxpayers nearly $1 billion over 30 years.The Damen Silos, once used to mix road-construction materials for the Illinois Department of Transportation, was transferred to the Illinois’ Central Management Services in 2005 after officially being declared useless.Initial bids for the property are due by October 19, and must be at minimum $3.25 million.— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2900 South Damen Avenue

The district, a state commission, is trying to attract more housing and retailers to give health care workers more options to live and shop nearby.An apartment building and hotel are being built near the intersection of Ogden and Damen Avenues, part of a long-stalled 1.2 million-square-foot mixed-use project known as the Gateway, and Naperville developer Marquette is building a 279-unit apartment building on Damen next to a 272-unit property it revamped and and reopened last year.Investors are targeting the area after Chicago developer John Murphy invested $140 million to transform the derelict former Cook County Hospital building into a 210-room hotel that opened in 2020, just south of Interstate 290 from the Rush office.The Canadian investment firm, which has a $10 billion portfolio of 224 properties across Canada, Brazil, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, also purchased four properties in suburban Chicago as part of its first acquisition package in the U.S.It paid $22.1 million for the Fox Valley Center for Health, a two-story, 46,000-square-foot building at 3310 West Main Street in St. Charles, while spending $22.4 million on a pair of adjacent medical properties at 2500 and 2580 West Fabyan Parkway in Batavia, a total of 39,800 interior square feet.

Lake Street and a rendering of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel (Google Maps, Solomon Cordwell Buenz & Associate)A downtown Chicago site with a history of failed redevelopment efforts that included a Mandarin Oriental Hotel and a 50-story skyscraper finally has a new owner.Patrick Hotung, chief executive of Main Place Liberty Group, paid $31 million for the 40,600 square foot site at 130 E. Lake Street last month. Bordering the Buffalo, New York-based firm’s two Michigan Avenue office towers, Hotung said he will keep the site’s hole-in-the-ground status for now to keep his office tenants happy.It’s not the right time to think about new developments, Hotung said, referring to the city’s record vacancy rates and uncertainty about the resurgent coronavirus.“We really don’t have any plans at the moment,” he said. “But we control it now and I don’t have to worry about someone putting up a 100-story building 10 feet from our property lines.”The site’s saga goes back to the early 1980s, when developers proposed a three-tower office complex known then as Michigan Boulevard, a nod to Michigan Avenue’s original name, according to Mark Buth, an MBRE broker who has worked at the site for many years. The 25-story tower at 225 N. Michigan was built in 1982, and 205 N. Michigan, at 44 stories, was completed in 1986. Both are now Hotung’s properties and are called Michigan Plaza.A 50-story third tower was part of the design for the full block bounded by Michigan Avenue, Lake Street, South Water Street and Stetson Avenue. But the plans were scrapped after the stock market crash of 1988 and economic after-effects the following year. The site, which sits at the corner of Lake and Stetson streets, has been vacant ever since.The East Loop location is still considered a prime piece of property because of its easy access to Michigan Avenue, Lake Michigan and Grant Park as well as the Aon Center. The zoning is still in place to develop a massive office or residential tower if and when the market can bear it.Most Chicagoans remember it best as the site of the planned 74-story Mandarin Oriental hotel and luxury condominiums. Another economic downfall – the Great Recession – put the kibosh on that project and the developer’s major creditor, iStar Financial, started a messy foreclosure proceeding that took seven years to complete.In 2019, CA Ventures, the Chicago-based firm, known for its student housing and apartment developments, looked at redeveloping the site but never proceeded. Hotung bought the property from iStar, according to Cook County records.Hotung said his tenants became antsy every time a new development proposal popped up, fearing they would lose their views. However, he’s not totally ruling that out.“If we come up with a good idea or if someone else does and wants to partner, we’ll certainly entertain it,” said Hotung, who is part of the Hong Kong Ho Tung family real estate dynasty. “But right now is not a time to be putting up any new buildings, either residential or commercial with the COVID Delta.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",130 E.

11:41 AM",Who gets to keep the art?,"[""162 West Hubbard and 200 West Adams (Google Maps, iStock)Who gets to keep the art?That’s a question downtown Chicago’s commercial landlords and their new tenants need to hash out these days while negotiating deals, one that rarely came up before the pandemic emptied offices.With high vacancies in the central business district, record amounts of sublease space, and one of the nation’s hottest spots for new commercial development next door in the Fulton Market office district, downtown landlords are in a tough spot.They’re willing to offer more perqs than ever for tenants to land new leases or extensions, including upgraded furniture, computer equipment and even artwork for the office, said Tony Karmin, a Chicago broker representing tenants for Colliers International. He just negotiated a 20,000-square-foot lease on behalf of the consultant Axiom to double its footprint at 200 West Adams Street.“All bets are off in this market. There are no dumb questions, there’s no dumb requests, there is no request that’s too aggressive,” Karmin said.All the swag reflects just how tough it is for landlords to fill office space after vacancies in the Loop surged to almost 30 percent and remain high in major metro areas across the nation. In San Francisco, one office landlord is offering a Mexican vacation to brokers who just book property tours for clients, and similar incentives are on tap in Chicago for those who set up multiple viewings, said Steve Goldstein, a tenant rep broker for ChicagoBroker.com, an affiliate of Jameson Commercial.While rental rates came down only slightly during the pandemic, concession packages from downtown landlords have gotten sweeter for tenants. They’re more flexible than before the health crisis, especially in terms of how tenants can use buildout allowances, the amount of money landlords make available to tenants for interior construction or renovations.Landlords previously let just a portion of unused funds from a tenant’s buildout get credited as rent, and would only reimburse tenants for hard construction and moving costs, while furniture, equipment and other soft costs were shouldered by tenants. Those limits in many cases have been removed.“That’s a really big difference between today and what we’ve seen in the past,” Karmin said.The deal structure has set off a hunt for spaces tenants can use as they are, without having to put big bucks into changing the previous occupant’s interior finish.“Really, our value and what we’re doing today is the evaluation of existing condition space,” Karmin said of tenant reps.Construction allowances have grown to reflect rising costs of materials and labor amid the pandemic; Karmin puts the range between $80 and $120 a square foot, with upwards of $100 becoming more common. Tenants and their brokers are capitalizing on those offers by finding ways to avoid using funds on building costs so they can put them toward rent.“Where the real deals are is if a tenant can reutilize existing space,” Karmin said. “Especially in those situations where you don’t need all the dollars to go into the space, a tenant can completely update their furniture, completely update their technology.”Bargains in Loop buildings aren’t enough to stop the momentum in Fulton Market, though. The former meatpacking district was Chicago’s only pocket where availability dropped in 2021, and new construction proposals there keep coming. It’s far more expensive to rent in Fulton Market, yet tenants have shown a willingness to cough up cash to be in buildings with amenities like fitness centers and rooftop decks.“You still have pretty unreal demand. They’re clamoring to be in Fulton Market,” said Ari Klein, a broker for Cushman & Wakefield.He pointed to 167 Green Street in the Fulton Market district, which is fully leased after signing multiple tenants through the pandemic, including two leases across 89,000 square feet by White Claw maker Mark Anthony Brands and Lukas Walton’s philanthropy and investment firm, deals first reported by Crain’s.“Chicago is not like a coastal market. It’s not like New York or San Francisco where we get these super low vacancy numbers. Chicago gets to 9 or 10 percent vacancy and that’s when people start to build,” Klein said.With vacancy nowhere near that low in much of the city, though, landlords are willing to haggle with tenants for discounts used on the front end of leases. They’d rather do that than lower advertised rental rates paid throughout the life of a lease because lenders are more sensitive to reduced rents. Getting cash out of buildings through refinancing in a few years would be complicated much more by cutting face rents than offering bigger concession packages.“A landlord can’t do you a favor that’s going to ding its ultimate property value. They’ve been offering way more incentives on the abatement side. They want the commitments. Abatement is OK for today as long as they have cash flow for the future,” said Klein.Even Goldstein, of ChicagoBroker.com, got out of the landlord business this year, choosing to sell a River North office building he owned for more than a decade at 162 West Hubbard Street for $5.9 million in a deal recorded in January – the sale price exceeded the $1.9 million mortgage attached to the property in 2008 and another $2 million mortgage from 2018.“I thought I would never sell,” he said. He wanted to unload it before pouring capital into the property’s ventilation and other upgrades needed to make workers feel safe amid the pandemic. “The market has become so tenant friendly.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",200 West Adams Street

(Redfin)Luxury buyers are still clamoring for properties in bucolic Lake Forest with two mansions selling this month for a combined $11.5 million.The pricier of the pair, a 9,100-square-foot estate, was purchased Tuesday for $6.2 million, according to Crain’s. It was the highest price paid for a home in the area in three years.The seller of the home at 980 N.

The closing price is a sharp drop from its January 2019 asking, when the property at 55 E. Onwentsia Road hit the market for $7.9 million. Designed by Phillip Liederbach of Liederbach & Graham, the property is on 3 acres.Overall, Chicago-area home sales have been on a months-long tear. Over 12,000 homes sold in April, a figure that even outpaced the area’s pre-pandemic April average. Housing supply is shrinking and median sales are up.\nIn 2020, Lake Forest saw the biggest percentage increase in home sales over 2019 of all Chicago-area suburbs.

In Joliet, the planned casino will be located in the Rock Run Crossings development near the interchange of interstates 80 and 55.The repositioning efforts follow the state’s largest gambling expansion in history in 2019, which Penn opposed at the time. It bred a new wave of competition for Illinois casino operators, as it included the issuance of six new casino licenses, with three of them in the Chicago area that are now nearing construction. New casinos are coming to Waukegan, the Homewood-Flossmoor area in the south suburbs, and, most notably, Chicago, where Bally’s won city approval to build a $1.6 billion facility in the River West area.The Aurora casino complex will also include a 200-room hotel with 10,000 square feet of meeting and event space, as well as bars, restaurants and a spa.“Since the change in law to permit land-side casino relocation in Illinois, we have been exploring the viability of relocating our aging riverboats in Aurora and Joliet,” Jay Snowden, CEO and president of Penn Entertainment, said in a statement about the plans.The Aurora casino will be built next to Chicago Premium Outlets on city-owned land near Farnsworth Avenue and Bilter Road. The city bought the land for $7 million in 2018 when two hotels stood on the site. The plans call for the city to donate the land and contribute up to $50 million in new bonds for the project.The public will be able to comment on the plans at a city council finance committee meeting on Thursday. If approved, construction on the new casino would begin at the end of next year.Aurora Alderman Emmanuel Llamas, who represents the 1st ward where the casino will rise, said that many of his constituents are against moving the casino to the Farnsworth site.— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Aldermen are up in arms and there’s even an allegation floating around that the mayor got bought off — for the chump-change sum of $6,000.None of that should come as a surprise for Bally’s, which like rivals in the gaming industry has had to put up with its share of political maneuvering ahead of last week’s decision by Mayor Lori Lightfoot.Yet the brouhaha that erupted over what is meant to be just a temporary gaming center while the real one is built underscores just how hard it is to push through major real estate projects — even when the mayor is on your side.Lightfoot chose the 130,000-square-foot Medinah Temple and former Bloomingdale’s store at 600 N. Wabash Ave. as the site for the temporary Bally’s location while the company develops its $1.7 billion casino project on the Chicago Tribune Publishing Center in River West.That was a detour from Bally’s original plan. The temporary casino site was initially at 700 West Chicago Avenue — a former Tribune advertising insertion plant that closed in 2012 — but was changed to the Wabash location at the urging of the city.The building, which is owned by Chicago developer Friedman Properties, has been vacant for more than two years. Opponents have raised concerns that Friedman Properties CEO Albert Friedman donated $6,000 to the mayor’s campaign fund on March 22, according to the Chicago Tribune. Friedman didn’t respond to a request for comment.Alderman Brendan Reilly, who represents the ward where the Medinah Temple casino would be located, called the idea “horrible,” during a hearing earlier this week. Reilly didn’t respond to a request for comment.The city is seeking an exception to allow liquor to be served inside the building, though the site is in a zone that prohibits additional liquor licenses. Deputy Mayor Samir Mayekar said granting an exception for the casino would be similar to exceptions for the city’s sports stadiums like Wrigley Field, and said it was needed to reduce vacancies.“No, that’s extraordinary,” Reilly said in the meeting. “The difference is this would be a brand-new casino in the middle of a mixed-use neighborhood downtown, whereas the stadiums … have been around for decades and in Wrigley’s case, a century, which long predates our liquor moratorium.”Perhaps the greatest unknowns are what will happen to the building once the permanent casino is completed and what the terms of Bally’s agreement with Friedman are. It’s unclear whether the temporary location could become a permanent casino at the end of the lease.Bally’s Chairman Soo Kim said Bally’s made inquiries about several sites city officials suggested, and the only one Bally’s could make a deal with was the Medinah Temple, though Kim was concerned about a lack of parking, according to the Chicago Tribune. Bally’s didn’t respond to a request for comment.The permanent site also has residents up in arms. At a town hall meeting on Thursday, everyone who spoke — a total of 80 community members — was in unanimous opposition to the River West site, according to Crain’s. Much of the criticism stems from how the massive entertainment complex will disturb those already living in the neighborhood.“You can see a pattern developing that the neighborhood does not want the casino,” Antonio Romanucci, a resident of River North, said at the meeting. “We are an older, established neighborhood community who have lived there for years and years to make it a neighborhood and now a casino is going to turn that upside down.”Should the casino get city approval, Bally’s plans to open it in 2023, and anticipates opening the permanent casino in 2026.Contact Miranda Davis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n The 78 developer Related Midwest goes dark after losing Chicago casino bid \n Chicago’s casino selection goes to Bally’s, and these real estate players win out \n Bally’s proposal for Chicago casino seen winning mayor’s approvalAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",600 N Wabash Avenue

Three houses in the same price range sold last year, one in 2020 and none in 2019.If there was more inventory to meet demand, the figure might be higher, said Jena Radnay, an @properties agent who represented both the buyers and sellers in this week’s Winnetka sale.\n“People are buying quickly if they can,” Radnay said.A Sheridan Road home asking just under $6 million went under contract 10 days after it hit the market last month. The price is undisclosed as the sale hasn’t closed yet.As more office employees worked from home during the pandemic, they sought more space and privacy in the suburbs. Luxury home sales also got a boost from stock market gains and low mortgage rates, and sales often led to bidding wars. About a third of the total 101 homes sold for $4 million and more last year came from the suburbs.The affordability of waterfront homes on the North Shore compared with other major cities is what is attracting buyers, said Ted Pickus, the @properties agent who represented sellers of the Highland Park house. Buyers “realize they’re getting a great value moving out to the suburbs in these big homes,” he said.The Highland Park home had an indoor pool, basketball court, a movie theater, and a backyard overlooking the lake, amenities that appealed to the buyers in the pandemic, Pickus added.In the city, 13 homes sold for $4 million or more as of mid-February, more than three-fold of the four houses sold in Chicago at the same time last year.Most recently, a six-bedroom, 8,400-square-foot mansion in Lincoln Park sold for $8.7 million this month. The home that had an outdoor living room, sports court area, and two terraces, went under contract before it hit the market.[Crain’s] – Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The home features five and a half bathrooms, a designer kitchen with a butler’s pantry and walk-in pantry, two wine cellars and an attached three-car garage. Views of the lake are available in almost every room.The couple also recently sold an eight-bedroom, 7,100-square-foot mansion in Kenilworth for $2.5 million. The couple had initially listed this Nantucket-style home for $3.3 million. However, after about three months on the market, they decided to lower the asking price for the home, which features a large coach house and 10-foot ceilings. The sale on this property closed on Sept. 15.The lakefront mansion in Winnetka had a $137,432 property tax bill for 2020, while the Kenilworth mansion had a $73,575 property tax bill in the same year.Luxury home sales have been common among business executives. In South Florida, Alden Global Capital managing director Heath Freeman recently purchased a waterfront mansion in Camp Biscayne for $19 million. Additionally, Jason Capello, who led Merchants’ Gate Capital, paid $30.7 million for a six-bedroom, 8,981-square-foot mansion in Palm Beach.Another wealthy couple, John and Jenny Paulson are now in the process of divvying up their properties — including multiple luxury properties — after filing for divorce.

Riverside swapped out that debt with a $470 million loan from Bank of America in 2017, the same year the tower was completed.Riverside courted potential buyers for the building in 2016.

Bank of America will lease 500,000 square feet and Lincoln Financial will lease 60,000 square feet in the 1.53-million-square-foot office tower once it’s completed in 2020.In October, city officials approved Riverside’s $900 million proposal to redevelop Union Station, including building a new 55-story office tower next to the train hub.The developer also is adding its name to a 7-acre chunk of the Chicago River District project being planned by Tribune Media in the River West neighborhood.Downtown office rents have lagged so far this year, as older building owners are forced to compete with a growing wave of class-A office complexes cropping up Downtown.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",110 North Wacker Drive

It’s the best thing going.’ I agree,” Lightfoot said at the festival. “And so I’m here to tell you by decree, we’re gonna make sure that Lolla continues in the future.”The music festival has helped Chicago’s hotels recover from the pandemic, despite the city’s continued reliance on business travel. The 223-room Sable Hotel on Navy Pier, for example, has been adding 60 to 70 rooms a day during the festival.Details of the contract, which will begin with the 2023 festival, haven’t been released, including how the city’s amusement tax will impact it. Executives with festival organizer C3 Presents had been asking the city to ensure the tax wouldn’t increase throughout the course of the new agreement.“There are now a total of eight Lollapaloozas on four continents, but Chicago remains the center of the Lollapalooza universe,” Charlie Walker, a partner at C3 Presents, said in a news release.The deal, which will also increase the attendance cap to 115,000 from 100,000, guarantees that C3 will pay at least $2 million if the four-day festival takes place; $1.5 million if the festival lasts three days; or $750,000 if the festival doesn’t go on.The Park District will receive between 5 and 20 percent of revenue from the festival over the term of the contract.The current deal between C3 and the park district was signed in 2012 and expired after the 2021 festival, when organizers decided to opt for a one-year extension for the most recent festival. So far, almost all of the deals for Lollapalooza have happened behind closed doors, with many — including the aldermen who represent Grant Park — left out of the discussions.The festival will take place over the last weekend of July or the first weekend of August.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Built in 1995, it sits on about an acre and is about a block from the town beach. The home has a wraparound staircase, crown moldings and leaded glass windows. The large kitchen also has a fireplace.Lovell’s daughter, Susan, told the outlet that her parents wanted to buy a house that was large enough for the whole family to get together. “We were never on top of each other,” she said.Lovell began his astronaut career in 1962 and flew the Gemini 7 and Gemini 12 missions orbiting the Earth as well as Apollo 8, the first to circle the moon.His 1970 mission aboard Apollo 13 was recreated on film in the 1995 movie of the same name, in which Tom Hanks played his character and delivered the iconic line. Lovell made an appearance in the film as the captain of the USS Iwo Jima, the ship that retrieved the astronauts after they splashed down.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Lincoln Ave (SPACE Architects + Planners, Getty)A new mixed-use development is coming to a Lincoln Avenue site near Chicago’s Uptown, though its developer Longford Construction first has to clear the site of a existing buildings.The firm took a stride toward doing that as the city granted demolition permits for Longford to remove four structures at 3914-3930 North Lincoln Avenue, Urbanize Chicago reported. The new five-story, 68-unit development will fill a parcel facing Lincoln and Damen avenues.The project will bring 68 residential units and 7,500 square feet of ground-floor retail to the city’s North Center area, just south of West Irving Park Road. The retail portion will have entrances on both Lincoln and Damen avenues. It’s being designed by SPACE Architects + Planners.To make the project more sustainable, the developer has approved a design that makes the building 10 percent more energy efficient than required by city code and 25 percent more efficient for stormwater drainage. Longford also plans incorporate measures that would reduce its water use by 25 percent compared to similar buildings designed to city code, and make half of the roof green with plantings.Seven of the residential units will be marketed as affordable housing for residents who make 30 percent of the area median income. Those units will be two- and three-bedroom floorplans. In addition, the project will also have a Divvy bike station on Damen where renters without cars will get a free one-year membership.General contractor Precision Excavating can now begin the demolition process to make way for new construction. When the project was first planned, construction was expected to begin in July 2022, but with the delay, the expected December 2023 completion date could be pushed back.Longford’s other projects underway include a 32-unit project in the Uptown neighborhood at 4453 North Hazel Street that’s slated for completion next year, as well as a 14-unit condo project at 4537 North Clark Street set for an April completion, its website shows.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",3914 N.

A unit in the building hasn’t sold for anything close to that price since 2018, when one sold for $7.7 million another went for $9.4 million.The tower was completed in 2009 and, at 98 stories high, is one of the world’s tallest residential buildings..According to Crain’s, buyers have either been turned off by the building’s association with the polarizing former president or they’ve just been more interested in finding condos in other pricey buildings like the St. Regis and the Tribune Tower. In 2021, six condos in downtown Chicago sold for $7 million or more — four at the St. Regis and Tribune and the other two in buildings on Lake Shore Drive and in Lincoln Park.The sellers of the 4,200-square-foot condo haven’t been identified. They live out of state and only used the condo “once or twice a year.”They bought it as raw space for $3.7 million in August 2010 and commissioned Chicago interior designer John Robert Wiltgen to finish it.

It now heads to the zoning committee, then the full Chicago City Council.The development would be a mix of one- and two-story homes, with up to four bedrooms each.The plan originally included townhouses and less green space. But over time, the focus shifted to single-family homes, according to the report. The developer plans to build the homes close to the road and close to each other. Sidewalks will also be included in the development.The complex will have multiple green spaces, including a small park.Each of the homes will be 30 feet tall and available in four different styles. The development will also include unattached garages for each home that will provide parking for two cars. The garages will be accessible via private rear alleys. In addition, 15 guest parking spaces will be built on the development’s north-running street, according to Chicago Yimby.The subdivision, which has been nicknamed “Lexington Square,” will put the homes on either side of a new private road in between the high school campus and the retirement community.

The return of Industrious to the neighborhood follows the exit of WeWork from the building, and the closure of the similarly sized Industrious space at 320 West Ohio Street in early 2021 after eight years.The Illinois Street building was bought by German Investor GLL for $75 million in 2015, and that company was bought by Macquarie in 2018.Salesforce is a longtime tenant of more than 100,000 square feet in the building, where it remains while waiting to expand into 500,000 square feet at its new namesake tower at Wolf Point. Construction on that property just topped off and is expected to be completed next year, which is also when the Salesforce lease was reported to be expiring.The decision by Industrious to beef up its Chicago-area presence with enough space for 350 seats comes on the heels of other coworking providers taking bullish stances on the city.WeWork just took 93,500 square feet in a Fulton Market building developed by Shapack Partners, the Swiss company International Workplace just expanded into its 49th Chicago-area location with a 10-year lease for 29,000 square feet at the new Bank of America tower, and Life Time Fitness just opened a 39,000-square-foot coworking space at its River North athletic club and will soon have more than 10 coworking options at or near its gyms across the country.Analysts have predicted flexible lease terms friendly to small businesses will be in high demand in the post-pandemic office market that so far has seen many companies shrink their leases. Such an environment would give a boost to coworking providers.“We’re happy to be back in River North,” Doug Feinberg of Industrious said in a statement that nodded to the neighborhood’s reputable nightlife. “Our latest River North location is perfect for members who prioritize work as much as they do play.”Industrious plans to have its newest coworking spot open by August.

Chicago restaurants opened for indoor dining about a year ago.Lost Lake’s Instagram post said a super spreader surge “wiped-out what would usually be our busiest time of the year.”“Thank you so much for all the support, from our very first day until this one,” the post continued. “You’ve made a lot of dreams come true over here.”Crain’s, citing data from food and beverage analytics firm Datassential, reports that roughly 280 restaurants closed in the fourth quarter of 2021, just as Covid-19 booster shots offered a tantalizing taste of a return to pre-pandemic fun for local diners after almost two years of lockdowns and social distancing. By comparison, just 23 restaurants closed in the fourth quarter of 2019, the last quarter before the pandemic, Crain’s reports.Not only have sales been down, but many restaurants, including Lost Lake, have had to close temporarily as a result of understaffing due to the spread of the coronavirus, according to Crain’s.Lost Lake’s announcement appears to have resonated with local diners – the bar, known for its creative cocktails, took to its Instagram page again over the weekend to thank the community for an outpouring of support after its announcement. Reservations for the upcoming weekend are sold-out and the bar has “very few” spaces left for walk-ins. The webstore also sold out of merchandise.“We were totally overwhelmed by the response yesterday– after a really abysmal month of to-go business, we were NOT prepared for the amount of folks that placed orders yesterday!” read the post.[Crain’s] – Harrison ConneryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Dermody hopes to build at least one warehouse by the end of 2023.The deal reflects a pandemic-era shift for Chicago’s commercial real estate, as companies like Allstate reduce office space and retailers seek more warehouses to meet surging e-commerce demand. Allstate said in October that it would sell the headquarters, its home for more than 50 years, as about 95 percent of employees in Northbrook choose to work from home.Dermody needs the green light from Glenview, Northbrook and Prospect Heights neighborhoods to move forward. Residents in other parts of Chicago have opposed warehouse developments, saying a slew of delivery trucks would add pollution and traffic congestion.Kiersey said his company will work with communities and that it plans to maintain a landscape buffer by planting trees and stormwater management ponds along Sanders Road and Interstate 294. He noted that infrastructure around the campus is already designed to handle thousands of employees and vendors each day at peak times.Dermody may contact Glenview or another suburb about its plans before it pushes forward with its development, the outlet reported.“We want to go where we’re wanted,” Kiersey told Crain’s.[Crain’s] — Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2775 Sanders Road

The hospitals announced on March 10 that Pipeline had executed a letter of intent to sell the facilities to the healthcare management group.West Suburban serves predominantly Black patients and residents of the Austin community of Chicago’s West Side, while Weiss serves a high proportion of Medicaid patients in the Uptown community on the city’s North Side.Both hospitals’ CEOs said they will stay in place through the transition.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Lincoln Ave., according to Crain’s. The company took over the $73 million project from developer Norm Hassinger and Greenspire Capital, which had collaborated with Skokie officials on the development, and began work in May 2018, the outlet reported.The project, called the Lucien Lagrange, would have 14,300 square feet of retail and was expected to be completed in December 2019, according to its website. The village agreed to kick in $5 million in tax-increment financing.While foundation work has been done and the garage nearly finished, the construction loan was never obtained. With the coronavirus having seized up the U.S. economy, lending markets have clamped down and thousands of commercial real estate borrowers are now looking for help to make their monthly mortgage payments. Loan servicers are working with borrowers on existing loans and are scrutinizing the impact Covid-19 has had on their ability to pay, according to a recent TRD Talks Live panel that covered the current commercial mortgage brokerage industry.Murphy told Crain’s that lenders are cautious, asking for “a couple of months to breathe” to allow for the crisis to subside, but he is hopeful.\nMurphy is also in the middle of a $1 billion redevelopment of the long vacant Cook County Hospital in Chicago, where he will bring hotels, offices, and retail. Last year, Murphy also filed plans for an office building in Fulton Market that would include 96,000 square feet of office space and 10,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.

A block over from the Mondelez building, Thor wants to build a 20-story office complex with ground-floor retail at the gateway to Fulton Market, one of several properties it owns in the neighborhood.It also owns the historic 1,639-key Palmer House Hilton at 17 East Monroe Street. Earlier this year, Thor took out a $427 million loan on the hotel, and it signed three retailers to leases combining for more than 20,000 square feet.The company said the Mondelez building features three distinct facades, contiguous floor plates, a landscaped terrace and green roof, and 300 feet of retail frontage. Some 10,000 square feet of retail space remains available for lease in the building, Thor said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",905 West Fulton Street

And the luxury market’s performance would be worse if not for the ultra-luxury market, which has been propped up by Downtown condo towers like No. 9 Walton.The suburbs, where Barrington Hill is located, meanwhile, logged a 13.5 percent year-over-year drop in the second quarter.But despite the challenging market, homeowners are not shying away from listing their luxury homes. And the average sales price of a luxury home — $1.3 million — was up 3 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, according to the RE/MAX report.In August, Chicago’s second biggest sale of the year — a North Shore Glencoe lakefront mansion — closed for $9.7 million.

Originally listed for $32 million, the property at 68 Locust Road went into contract on June 5, last priced at $9.5 million, the outlet reported.Sherwin Jarol, who is CEO of Chicago-based real estate firm SMB/Bradley, and his wife Deborah, tapped Landry Design Group to build the home, known as Le Grand Reve, after buying the site for $2.6 million. In 2011, the sellers told the Wall Street Journal that the house cost over $40 million to build. Landry is known for developing McMansion-style homes for celebrities in Los Angeles.It’s unclear who the buyer is for the property, called Le Grand Reve. The Jarols’ agent, @properties’ Jena Radnay, did not comment. But in January, she told the Chicago Tribune that she believed it was “underpriced” for the amount of work put into it and the quality of the build.“It’s the finest-built house in the Midwest,” Radnay said. “I have shown it many times in November and December. … Those that have a high level of knowledge of what things cost to construct know that [Le Grand Reve] is a phenomenal value.”The home, designed in a Mediterranean style, features a domed ceiling, double-stairs with iron railings, marble floors, a paved motor court with fountain, a swimming pool and spa, chef’s kitchen with a restaurant-style bar and a nine-car garage.The sale represents another disappointing mansion trade in Winnetka. In March, a 12,000-square-foot mansion in the town sold for $3.2 million, half of what the owner Robert F. Steel paid for it during the Great Recession.Those still on the hunt for an opulent mansion in the Chicago area still have a wealth of potential options. Among them are Michael Jordan’s Highland Park mansion, forever on the market for $14.9 million; the Parillo mansion in Lincoln Park that’s listed at $45 million, the highest price in the state; and the 30,000-square-foot Middle Easern-influenced mansion in Burr Ridge that was listed $6 million before it was removed from the market.

The firm partnered with Triangle Capital Group on this week’s acquisition of the property, first reported by the Daily Herald.Terms of the purchase were not released, and the deal had not been recorded by Thursday afternoon in county records.Somerset wants to convert the AT&T property into 1.2 million square feet of offices, 60,000 square feet of shops and restaurants, and 60,000 square feet of conference space, storage and amenities.The firm plans to sell some of the land adjacent to the main AT&T office building to another developer for the construction of up to 380 apartments and 170 townhouses, according to the Daily Herald.Somerset hopes to replicate its success in converting the former Bell Labs campus in Holmdel, New Jersey, into the Bell Works complex. It plans to call the Hoffman Estates project Bell Works as well.Somerset President and CEO Ralph Zucker in a statement called the closing an important milestone, “and another huge step toward the creation of Chicagoland’s first metroburb.”Taconic Capital Advisors provided financing for the acquisition and pre-development costs, Somerset said. Colliers will serve as exclusive broker for Bell Works.The metroburb concept, a dense urban-like development within a suburban setting, is designed to help solve the issues created by companies departing their massive suburban headquarters for cities in search of young talent.Large former corporate headquarters like the vacant AT&T site in Hoffman Estates frequently are mentioned as a driver of suburban office vacancy rates, along with the former GE Healthcare complex in Barrington, the old McDonald’s headquarters in Oak Brook and the former Motorola Solutions campus in Schaumburg, which is undergoing a redevelopment of its own.Texas-based loan servicer C-III Asset Management took control of the AT&T site in a sheriff’s sale in 2017, after its former owner was hit with a $132 million foreclosure suit when AT&T’s lease expired in 2016, according to Crain’s.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The fund will invest in multifamily assets in large markets across the country, including Chicago, the outlet reported.“The undersupply of housing in the United States should continue to benefit the multifamily industry as demand is projected to outpace supply over the next five years in certain markets,” Hurd said in a statement. “And, people will increasingly seek more flexible and affordable housing options.”[CBJ] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Jackson Boulevard, a person close to the deal told Crain’s that bids are expected at about $16 million, or about $140 per square foot. Stockbridge hired the Chicago office of Cushman & Wakefield for the sale.A Stockbridge venture paid $23.5 million for the eight-story property in 2017, when it was about half occupied and demand was strong for downtown office space. The company spent close to $8 million on upgrades and renovations, including almost $2 million to build move-in-ready office suites.The sale will test whether investors are still interested in brick-and-mortar office buildings amid the work-from-home shift during the pandemic. Many companies are seeking newer buildings with efficient air filtration systems, which could be a disadvantage for older properties like this one.Stockbridge sued one of the tenants in 2020 over unpaid rent. In the lawsuit, Stockbridge said New York-based Industrious abandoned its space and the $4 million it owes on a lease that runs through 2030.

Synergy will also receive funding from a special municipal taxing district that includes the site of the proposed development.In exchange, Synergy will cover 25 percent of the cost — up to $150,000 — of any unspecified improvements to Plaza Circle and contribute $984,600 in impact fees to government agencies that will be affected by the project.Synergy is expected to break ground this year and be open to its first tenants by early 2024.— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

It’s unclear which agents represented the buyer and seller.The seller was a trust on behalf of the late Frederick Krehbiel, the former CEO of Molex, a Lisle-based electronic components company that his grandfather founded in 1938. Krehbiel died in 2021 at 80.Few details of the home are public because it was sold off market. Real estate sites put the home at seven bedrooms, 3.5 bathrooms and about 11,000 square feet. The home was built by Lemuel Freer at the turn of the 20th century, according to the Hinsdalean. Freer was the son of real estate developer L.C. Paine Freer. The home, which was designed by David Adler, originally had a third floor that included a ballroom and a boxing ring, but that floor was removed in 1934.Including this property, eight Hinsdale homes sold for at least $4 million in the past three years. A mansion there sold for $7.7 million last year, the priciest residential deal in the region and highest ever for the village, easily topping a previous high was $5.5 million.The buyer was an LLC created to hold the property; it’s unclear who is behind it. A lawyer associated with the LLC didn’t respond to a request for comment.Krehbiel was the nephew of legendary Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck and was born near Downers Grove, Illinois, according to an obituary by The Chicago Tribune. In 1965, Krehbiel joined Molex and established the company’s international division and later oversaw the company’s $7.1 billion sale to Koch Industries Inc. in 2013.After retiring, Krehbiel purchased Ballyfin, a 19th century estate in Ireland. He restored the 35,000-square-foot mansion, which is about 60 miles southwest of Dublin, and turned it into a hotel.Contact Miranda Davis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n Ex-Blackhawks player, TV analyst Konroyd asking $4M for home \n Hinsdale megamansion sale sets record \n Couple lists sprawling Hinsdale mansion for $6M.

At that time, Mayor Lori Lightfoot imposed a curfew that lasted into the first week of June.Monday morning’s violence erupted hours after police shot a man in his 20s who officers say had fired at them, according to Block Club Chicago.

Affected stores included those in River North, along with the Near North Side, the Gold Coast, the Loop and the South Loop. In Lincoln Park, the Apple store was also damaged, according to the report.The Chicago Tribune reported that the crowds numbered in the hundreds.Near Michigan Avenue and Lake Street, officers exchanged gunfire with people in the crowd and the police SWAT team was sent in, Block Club reported. Some of the looters had driven to the locations, according to the outlet.Following the June looting and rioting that left numerous stores damaged, Gov. J.B.

When the family first listed the home in March, asking about $16 million, they were optimistic about the property’s future even if the home were to be demolished.“Either way you go, it’s a project,” Annie Challenger, a daughter of James and Ruth “Timmie” Challenger who is a Baird & Warner agent, told the outlet at the time. “Either you love the house and want to restore it as a project, or you decide to build your own and it’s still a project.”After the sale closed and it became clear the buyers wanted to tear down the house, Annie Challenger, who represented the property for herself and four other James Challenger heirs, told the outlet that “as much as people love houses, we can’t dictate what new owners do.”The house, on about 1.7 acres, was the sixth to sell for $10 million or more in the Chicago area this year. It’s also the second-priciest in Winnetka for 2022, trailing a $16 million sale in July.James and Timmie Challenger paid $200,000 for the property in 1970, the equivalent of about $1.46 million today.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",645 Sheridan Rd

The annual average over the past 25 years has been 3,200 new units, according to Integra.And deconversions, like the $60 million, 292-unit deal Golub and USAA Real Estate recently closed at Century Tower, are tipping the inventory balance even more toward rentals in many parts of the city, including Downtown.“Just given the strength of the rental market, it’s probably easier to develop rental than condo right now,” Integra’s Gail Lissner said.Some of that demand might be driven by recent job growth Downtown, as large companies like McDonald’s leave office space in the suburbs and come to the city center.A rendering of McDonald’s new HQ in Fulton Market (Credit: Sterling Bay)According to Integra, Downtown added 19,448 workers in 2017, a 3.4 percent increase from a year before — the biggest single-year gain in at least five years.Even if the influx continues, will there be enough demand to fill all the new apartments?Related Realty’s Spreen said it matters what part of Downtown a project is in.The Tribune Tower project’s location in Streeterville near the river and the Michigan Avenue shopping district will make it attractive, Spreen said.“This is probably as good as it gets,” she said.At the far end of the downtown area, in the South Loop, new inventory could present a bigger challenge.Crescent Heights is building a 792-unit rental tower called One Grant Park in an area that includes a 479-unit project being built by Oxford Capital and several other large rental projects.The projects will bring thousands of new units to a part of Downtown that doesn’t have as much of a longstanding history as a residential area as neighborhoods like Streeterville or the Gold Coast.“I think the South Loop is going to have a few challenges 12 to 18 months from now,” Integra’s Ron DeVries told Crain’s in February.A rendering of One Grant ParkAaron Galvin, CEO and founder of luxury Living Realty Chicago, said whether the new inventory will be absorbed comes down to whether developers make the rent feel worth it to tenants.“Really you have a tale of two rental markets: There’s a very high-end market with larger unit sizes, and then there are the projects with smaller units, that’s where the majority of the demand is,” he said. “I think if a renter is going to pay the premium for those smaller units, they’re going to demand uber-nice finishes, excellent views and prime locations.”Kyle Stengle of Marcus & Millichap’s investment, national multifamily and mixed-use group, said the rental boom Downtown is unlikely to last much longer.“At some point there’s just going to be too many units and we may already be there. The overall feeling is that the market’s getting over-saturated.

The vote faced fierce opposition because of Presence’s anti-abortion policy.Earlier this month, the Chicago Board of Ethics fined Burke $2,000 for presiding over the meeting despite having previously represented Presence through his private property tax appeal law firm.After AMITA Health acquired Presence and its 10 Chicago-area hospitals in December, it requested an extension for finalizing the TIF agreement, the Sun-Times reported. But this week, AMITA CEO Mark Frey announced his group “has decided not to complete the paperwork required to finalize the Presence Health TIF agreement,” with no further explanation.Fresh off his re-election victory in February, Burke is set next week to be sworn in for his 13th term in the City Council. But the alderman is still facing federal charges in an alleged extortion scheme, and he’s been tarnished by a trickle of smaller scandals in the interim.

The buyer is not yet identified in Cook County records.Nancy Tassone with Jameson Sotheby’s Int’l Realty was the listing agent, and said she was unable to comment on the deal. Julie Harron of Jameson Sotheby’s was the buyer’s agent and didn’t immediately return a request for comment.Griffin was poised to take a loss on the home even if it had sold at its full listing price. He bought it in 2014 for $13.3 million.It’s the first of four high-end Chicago condos to sell after Griffin put them on the market in the wake of his decision to move his family and company, the hedge fund and financial services firm Citadel, to Florida. He has already assembled a $1 billion real estate portfolio there, including Miami-Dade County’s most expensive residential purchase in history at $107 million.The other three are still active listings, according to Zillow.Those include an 8,000-square-foot full-floor condominium on the 66th floor of the Park Tower at 800 North Michigan Avenue for $13.25 million; a 9,250-square-foot full-floor condominium on the Park Tower’s 67th and top floor for $15.75 million; and a 7,085-square-foot unfinished condominium on the 35th floor of the building at 9 West Walton Street for $14 million.The Lincoln Park mansion that’s long been lived in by Griffin’s ex-wife, Anne Dias, also returned to the market this month for $9.5 million, a cut from a quiet $10 million sale recorded in Cook County records this summer.This week’s deal wasn’t the first sale Griffin’s made for more than $10 million in the Waldorf building. In 2014, he paid $16 million for a full-floor unit on the building’s 46th floor, and the next year sold it to billionaire Jude Reyes, the co-chairman of beer and food distributor Reyes Holdings, for the same price.Griffin still hasn’t listed his unfinished space on the top three floors in the building at 9 West Walton. He paid $58.75 million in four separate transactions for the 35th through 38th floors of the building in 2017.

The first phase would include six soundstages encompassing over 200,000 square feet.Dudley, who has a team of investors for the project, said there was no reason the city couldn’t be the “Hollywood of the Midwest,” he told Crain’s. He is a producer on Showtime’s “The Chi,” a series filmed in North Lawndale’s Cinespace Chicago Film Studios. The report noted Cinespace is undergoing a major expansion.Dudley’s proposal comes as investors continue to gobble up studio space and plan new developments.Last month, Knickpoint Ventures began searching for a partner for its $200 million production studio and office complex redevelopment at the former Marshall Field’s warehouse.In Los Angeles, there has been a flurry of big projects and acquisitions. This month alone, Atlas Capital Group said it would build a $650 million, 17-soundstage complex in Downtown L.A.; and Bardas Investment Group and Bain Capital Real Estate want to build a $450 million production studio and office complex in Hollywood.In March, a group of potential buyers emerged for Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York City. Bids for the 11 production stages that total 150,000 square feet, in addition to 325,000 square feet of offices, value the property at around $600 million.[Crain’s] — Alexi FriedmanAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Christopher Reyes in front of Glanworth Gardens (Getty Images, Lake Geneva Estates)Billionaire J. Christopher Reyes and his wife, Anne, have been revealed as the buyers of a Lake Geneva mansion once owned by late financial executive Richard Driehaus.Walworth County deed records show the stately Georgian-style mansion was bought on Jan. 14 through an opaque Delaware limited liability company, according to the Chicago Tribune. Reyes was confirmed as the buyer through county records and people familiar with the matter, the newspaper reportedThe 12-bedroom, 14,145-square-foot mansion went under contract in less than three weeks and sold for a Wisconsin state record of $36 million, more than the sum of the second and third priciest homes in the area. The lakefront estate set on 40 acres is known as Glanworth Gardens.Reyes, who has an estimated net worth of $7.1 billion, is co-chairman of Rosemont-based beer and food distribution firm Reyes Holdings, and is the 128th wealthiest American, according to the Tribune, which cited Forbes.The mansion was built in 1906 for Norman Harris, founder of a banking firm that bore his name and grew into Harris Trust, now BMO Harris Banks. After Harris died in 1916, Yellow Taxi Cab Company founder Walden W. Shaw bought the estate, and he passed it down to his son-in-law Daniel F. Peterin, who was the president of Morton Salt.The previous record in Lake Geneva was set in April when Thomas Tisbo spent $12.75 million on a 12-year-old, 13,000-square-foot, 10-bedroom lakefront mansion. The home next door to Glanworth Gardens is for sale with the area’s second-highest list price. That’s the 12,396-square-foot, six-bedroom Villa Hortensia, which sits on 20.5 acres and was listed for $20.75 million in February.[Chicago Tribune] – Harrison ConneryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Those jobs, which will include positions in web services, retail and advertising, will add to the more than 1,000 workers currently based in Amazon’s Loop office.The latest deal is the third time Amazon has expanded its office footprint since moving into the building in 2016.Amazon currently has 250 job openings in its Chicago office. The company is hiring for multiple roles including data engineers, business development managers, financial analysts and user-experience researchers. Amazon’s new office space will be available to employees beginning in late 2022.“Amazon’s continued growth and expansion in Chicago is testament to the city’s strengths in distribution and transportation, our direct connectivity across the world, diverse workforce and network of academic institutions training the workforce of tomorrow,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement.The Tishman-Speyer-owned Adams Street building was about 77 percent leased before Amazon’s most recent expansion. Combined, the Adams Street and Monroe Street buildings, which are known as the Franklin, are almost 86 percent leased including Amazon’s new space.Amazon has built multiple distribution centers and delivery stations throughout the Chicago area in neighborhoods like Pullman, Gage Park and Humboldt Park and hired more than 15,000 people as a result.

The statement didn’t disclose the price and a Kimco spokeswoman declined to provide detailsThe 179,000-square-foot property at 308 South McLean Boulevard includes the Elgin Mall and a grocery store, Elgin Fresh Market, as well as a Family Dollar, Subway, Taco Bell and Aaron’s furniture store. The property was built in 1958, according to a listing on LoopNet.The property manager notified Elgin Mall vendors who lease space inside the mall that it would close and that they would have to be out by the end of August, the Elgin Courier-News reported. The mall has been in operation for 20 years, according to the newspaper.The business owners formed a corporation and will be allowed to remain in the mall while they work out a deal, according to the Courier-News.Mario Farfan, executive director of the NorthWest Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, learned over the weekend that the mall would close, according to a post from the group’s Facebook page. More than 100 vendors had been given notices to move out by the end of August, the group said.The chamber said the vendors are marking progress toward a contract to extend their leases in the mall for nine months. The group said that they and the Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce are working with the vendors to help them find space.This isn’t the first time a suburban Chicago shopping center owner has been at odds with the local community. New York’s Kohan Retail Investment Group fell behind on its tax bill for six Spring Hill Mall property parcels in June, sparking the ire of local leaders. In Calumet City, the mayor is pushing River Oaks Mall owner Namdar Realty Group to sell the property to make way for his plan to redevelop it into an entertainment center.A Chicago real estate investment firm acquired a struggling mall in Bolingbrook for $30 million in April, handing Starwood Capital Group a steep loss on the property.Other recent suburban shopping center deals in the area include a local investment firm’s $16 million profit on a Naperville shopping center, an Arkansas firm that picked up a 50,000-square-foot complex in Lake Forest for $20 million and local investor North American Real Estate’s $30 million purchase of Glen Ellyn’s Market Plaza.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",308 South McLean Boulevard

Cottage Grove Avenue and Bright Star Church is at 735 E. 44th Street (Live At 4400 Grove, Google Maps)Chicago’s Bronzeville neighborhood may be getting some more affordable housing near the site of the 4400 Grove development completed in 2020.The Michaels Organization is teaming with suburban Northbrook-based Brinshore Development on a $38 million proposal to build 71 units across a complex of eight buildings between East 44th and 45th streets and South Cottage Grove and South Evans avenues, according to plans filed to Chicago officials.It would be the latest instance of multifamily developers targeting the city’s neighborhood dubbed its “Black Metropolis,” where interest in real estate was fierce in 2021. Some of that was fueled by last year’s approval of the $3.8 billion Bronzeville Lakefront megaproject that will include 4,800 dwellings, hotels and a life sciences center planned across 100 acres with completion planned in 2041.The median price of a home sold in Bronzeville last year through November hit $550,000, well above the $318,000 citywide average for the same period, according to The Real Deal, and more newly built homes, 28, sold in Bronzeville than in any other Chicago neighborhood in 2021. Developers have focused on the neighborhood, where vacant lots number in the thousands after a period of years with little investment activity in the area.If approved, the new project would bring 51 units reserved for people making between 30 and 60 percent of the area median income, or $44,760 for a two-person household. The other 20 units would be priced at market rates.The business partners have joined on housing development throughout Chicago that has brought 1,500 units to the city over the past 20 years, said Andrea Keeney, vice president of development at The Michaels Organization. That includes the 4400 Grove site that opened in 2020 adjacent to the recently proposed project.The mixed-use development, on the site of the Chicago Housing Authority’s former Washington Park Homes demolished in 2002, brought 18,000 square feet of retail and commercial space fronting South Cottage Grove Avenue that is now fully leased by businesses such as a wine store, a salon and an aquarium store, Keeney said. It also included 84 apartments, 38 of them being restricted to people making 60% or less of the area median income, and 21 of them being public housing.“At this point, we’re starting to have tenants move in and operate in those [commercial] spaces,” she said. “That was the emphasis of the first phase, to select local retailers to bring much-needed amenities to the community.”She described the 71-unit proposal on the table now as the “second phase” of the 4400 Grove project, which cost about $38 million to build and will consist of entirely residential space. The estimated cost of the next phase is also $38 million so far, Keeney said.It will replace the Bright Star Church building on the development site, and the religious organization will be given access to community space within the new development, Keeney said.The developers have applied for tax credit financing from the Illinois Housing Development Authority to move the project forward, and will know in May whether it is selected for funding, Keeney said. She hopes construction on the project could start in 2023.The unit mix consists of 24 one-bedrooms, 29 three-bedrooms, and 18 three-bedrooms, she said.“There is a need for this type of housing, especially in the Bronzeville community. We think this mix is going to be really successful,” Keeney said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",4400 Grove at 4424 S.

Each home will sit on a standard Chicago lot and is expected to be marketed for $300,000.They will be “colorful, with industrial materials and a lot of light,” Burton told the outlet. Preliminary designs show houses with a mix of different exterior walls, rooftop decks, breezeways and attached garages.Building with shipping containers is often cheaper than using traditional materials and is faster. Shells arrive on site pre-built, allowing for the home to be built in about six weeks, Burton said. Still, some developers and architects say shipping containers aren’t the best use for homes because insulating them is harder.Within the last year, 26 homes in Greater Grand Crossing sold for between $270,000 and $325,000. Burton told the outlet that the shipping container homes will add to a limited inventory of homes for sale “and they’re going to look better than an old vintage house that got fixed up.”The developers held a ceremonial groundbreaking in Ju e at the site at 72nd Street and Vincennes Avenue. Work on the foundations began in August after the city approved that stage of the project.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The landlord is prolific Chicago developer Sterling Bay.Groupon’s sublease hopes could be a harbinger of what’s to come in Chicago’s office leasing market, with so many companies having laid off or furloughed employees in the wake of the virus.Prior to the pandemic, Chicago’s downtown office leasing market was having its best year since before the last recession, with companies gobbling up more downtown space than any year since 2007. It’s terrible news for landlords that already had vacancies and companies in the middle of developing new office towers.But like many other companies, Groupon is teetering on the brink. It plans to cut 44 percent of its workforce — about 2,800 employees — by the end of 2021. It had previously put up 40,000 square feet of space on the sublet market last year, before its stock fell and its CEO was ousted.Other big companies have also signaled that they wouldn’t need all the space they’d signed on for. Uber told the Tribune last month it was delaying the build-out of its 463,000-square-foot Old Post Office space.

The existing building would be demolished.“It’s going to be in a neighborhood of need for sure even though … we know gentrification is happening in a lot of different areas of the South Side,” said Dr. John Jay Shannon, CEO of Cook County Health, according to the report.Though the bed count has been reduced, the new building would also have the space for 70 outpatient exam rooms.Plans for the new facility follow a 2014 study that estimated Provident would need to spend at least $298 million modifying existing facilities to keep pace with competitors.The project is part of Cook County Health’s larger plan to modernize hospital facilities. Most of the Provident project will be paid for with $192 million in bonds to be paid down in 20 years, from revenue made on patients, Shannon said. The rest would come out of the hospital’s operating budget. Construction on the new building is expected to be completed in April 2023.In February, MCZ Development secured a $27 million loan for its long-delayed plan to convert the vacant Edgewater Medical Center into apartments.

Two developers who razed a residential neighborhood last year have already leased three of the four warehouses they built on the site.Prologis and ML Realty spent $64 million, or an average of $615,000 per house, to buy a Bensenville neighborhood where public data shows only a handful of homes ever sold for more than $400,000, according to Crain’s. Less than six months later, the project near O’Hare International Airport is paying dividends.In the two newest deals, UPS leased a 363,000-square-foot warehouse that Prologis is building at Devon and Central avenues, while a Swiss logistics company called Kuehne & Nagel leased a 289,000-square-foot building next door, Crain’s reported, citing people familiar with the matter and CoStar Group.Apex Logistics, a logistics firm that serviced the e-commerce industry, previously leased a building just under 300,000 square feet.

Crain’s reported the results.Home buying will become increasingly difficult in other major cities, most notably New York, Philadelphia, Washington and Seattle. But the firm sees Chicago remaining affordable through late 2021.Chicago’s housing market remains among the slowest-growing in major U.S. cities for most of the past two years, as tracked by the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices. Adding to the bad news, it has more than twice as many homeowners who are underwater on their mortgage than the national average.The John Burns data compares cities to their own price history, figuring in variables such as incomes, home prices and employment growth, both past and projected.Using that data, the monthly payment on a median-priced Chicago home will stay in the range of 23 percent to 24 percent of the median household income though late 2021. To compare, housing costs ate up 35 percent of income during the housing boom.One recent report showed the expensive-home market has leading the way, with sales of homes valued at $500,000 or above growing substantially year over year.

That’s a direct flip from last year’s survey, when 48 percent of respondents predicted an increase in investment and 43 percent said it would stay the same.Two-thirds of investors also said they expect prices to rise on industrial properties, about the same as last year. But 38 percent of respondents said they’re bracing for price increases of 5 percent or more, up from 34 percent of those surveyed in 2017.Developers attribute their growing appetite for warehouse and manufacturing projects to the multiplying demands of a growing e-commerce industry, and about a third of investors surveyed identified Internet sales as the No. 1 factor driving investment. But another 38 percent cited a more fundamental force — the “general strength of the economy” — as the main fuel for their optimism.If the country keeps racking up GDP growth anywhere near the 4.2 percent annual rate registered during the second quarter this year, industrial investors have no reason to turn off the spigot, according to Jim Martell, CEO of Chicago-based warehouse developer Logistics Property Co.“E-commerce has been a very positive disruptor for us, ever since it started up about 10 years ago,” Martell said. “But we’re also seeing our population and GDP grow, and demand for warehousing is highly correlated with the growth of GDP.”But the survey also flagged a handful of potential hazards that should worry anyone with a stake in industrial real estate. About 28 percent of investors said tariffs on foreign products represent the most immediate threat, and others said they’re factoring the prospect of higher interest rates into their investment decisions.The report also noted a “shortage in quality assets” when it comes to acquiring property for industrial construction, pushing developers to widen their search for promising land.The country’s feverish pace of spec warehouse construction has raised eyebrows among some industry pros, including Equity International chairman Sam Zell, who earlier this year predicted a “market clearing” for industrial landlords.But bullish industrial investment also means builders will likely have enough cushion to withstand a glut of vacant space if it emerges, Martell said.“There are probably some markets getting a little over their skis, but if there’s a correction that just means a pause until we see some more absorption,” Martell said. “And even if supply and demand end up getting a little out of sync, that provides an opportunity for a more rent-sensitive user to move up into class-A buildings that may be vacant.”A CBRE report last month highlighted the Chicago area and the Inland Empire area around Los Angeles among the most active markets for industrial and logistics leases. Southern California tallied 11.6 million square feet of deals signed, followed by Atlanta at 7 million square feet, Chicago at 6.8 million square feet, Pennsylvania’s Interstate 78/I-81 corridor at 6.8 million square feet and Dallas-Fort Worth at 5.2 million square feet.In New York, the price per square foot of industrial properties rose by as much as 81 percent this year in some parts of the city.And industrial markets throughout Florida are experiencing a return to pre-recession occupancy levels and rental rates, according to a Cushman & Wakefield report.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The Bears signed a purchase agreement for the Arlington International Racecourse a year ago.The mayor presented three options. The first, announced earlier this month, would be to enclose the stadium with a dome. The second would make the field “dome ready” with columns at each of the end zones. The third would be to revamp the stadium as a multipurpose venue that could host soccer and other events.“Soldier Field must be a year-round destination,” Lightfoot said in the presentation.According to the mayor, whichever option is chosen will depend on which anchor tenant the field can secure. That will also determine the final cost of the renovations.Despite the latest attempts to keep the team in the city, the Bears didn’t show any interest in the updated renovation plans and when asked for a comment, released a statement from earlier this month.“The only potential project the Chicago Bears are exploring for a new stadium development is Arlington Park,” the statement said. “As part of our mutual agreement with the seller of that property, we are not pursuing alternative stadium deals or sites, including renovations to Soldier Field, while we are under contract.The Bears “intend to honor our contractual commitments as we continue our due diligence and predevelopment activities on the Arlington Heights property,” the team said.Lightfoot said the team would be “foolish” not to consider staying in the city, saying it would be cheaper to stay at Soldier Field than to build another venue somewhere else.Soldier Field, which is owned by the Chicago Park District, has the smallest crowd capacity in the NFL with 61,500 seats.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The house does not have a garage but a parking pad is available that can fit six cars.While the house is embraced by the community for its unique shape, the construction in 2003 led to some local outrage. The village’s mayor and trustees faced complaints that the home is an “architectural pie-in-the-face,” the Tribune reported.Chicago’s housing market is off to a robust start after closing last year on a high note. The median price of city homes rose 3.3 percent to $315,000 last month from December 2020, according to trade group Illinois Realtors.Most agents expect the housing market frenzy to continue in 2022. Compass’ recent survey of agents shows more than half of the respondents believe pent-up demand will outweigh new supply, driving competition and price growth to favor sellers in 2022.[Chicago Tribune] – Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

12:00 PM",Chicago had more complaints about rats so far this year than New York — even though its population is three times smaller.,"[""RentHop’s Study depicting Chicago’s rodent population (RentHop, Stock, Photo illustration by Priyanka Modi)Chicago had more complaints about rats so far this year than New York — even though its population is three times smaller.More than 60,000 people complained to Chicago’s 311 line between Jan. 1 and Nov. 10, Crain’s Chicago Business reported, citing a study by RentHop. New Yorkers made fewer than 26,000 calls about rats in the same period. Chicago had a population of 2.71 million in 2019 compared with New York’s 8.42 million.RentHop’s data, which dates to 2016, shows that Chicago has had consistently more rat complaints than New York each year since then, prompting RentHop to dub Chicago “the forever rat capital in the U.S.”Wondering where they all are? There’s an app for that.The four cities from which RentHop compiles 311 rat complaints are New York, Chicago, Boston and Washington D.C. because they’re some of the most crowded cities in the nation. “Denser population usually means more apartment buildings, more food sources, and therefore, more rodents,” said analyst Shane Lee,Chicago complaints topped the combined number from the other three cities, where they totalled just over 40,000. Boston was the only one where the number declined from the previous year. While the increase was bigger In New York and Washington, Chicago had so many that it isn’t likely that New York will seize the dubious honor, Lee said.Another ranking, from pest control service provider Orkin, found similar results. Based on the number of rat treatments provided, Orkin has ranked Chicago atop its annual “50 rattiest cities” ranking for the past seven years.Chicago’s Department of Streets & Sanitation had so many rat complaints during the pandemic that it opened two more rodent control offices in the city this fall.And not to slight New York, the city has its own rat-tracker.[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Green St. (Credit: Sterling Bay and FreightWaves)Six months ago, freight tech firm Flexport signed a lease to occupy 40,000 square feet at Sterling Bay’s latest office building, 333. N. Green St. in Fulton Market.But in today’s Covid-19 world, the San Francisco-based company has abandoned those plans and will look to sublease the space as it shifts to a part work-from-home model, Crain’s reported. Flexport has offices at 370 N. Carpenter St. as well as a WeWork location not far away, though it previously said it had outgrown both.The company signed with Sterling Bay in December and expected to move 140 employees into the new 550,000-square-foot building. It never made the move to the 19-story complex, known as Gr33n, Crain’s reported.“Like many companies, Flexport is reevaluating its real estate strategy as it explores a hybrid working model,” a Flexport spokeswoman told Crain’s in a statement. “We’ll be taking a closer look at the Chicago commercial real estate market over the next few months to determine the right office location and size for our team.”Flexport’s lease, which runs through March 2027, hired CBRE to market the space for sublease, according to the report.The decision abandon the move is a blow to Sterling Bay and Chicago’s CRE market, which had been touting the emergence of tech companies like Uber that have been taking big leases. Last year, Chicago saw more than 2 million square feet of new office space absorbed into the Downtown market, about 50 percent higher than the year before. With the new office space and an increasing number of firms moving to the city from the suburbs, residential developers began building pricier projects in Chicago, able to attract young upwardly-mobile workers.Sterling Bay’s Gr33n building, which it will make its new headquarters, includes 35,000 square feet of retail. The developer inked leases for the under-construction building with advertising agency WPP, co-working firm Convene and global accounting giant Ernst & Young. Early last month, Convene said it would reduce its own office capacity by 50 percent companywide to allow workers to maintain social distancing.The coronavirus, which upended the local economy, has also cast doubt on the long-term need for that kind of massive office space in an increasingly work-from-home world.Founded seven years ago, Flexport received a $1 billion investment from Softbank in early 2019.

Scott Fitzgerald and socialite Ginevra King Mitchell with house at 901 Rosemary Road in Chicago (Getty, Wikipedia, Zillow)A Lake Forest mansion with ties to F. Scott Fitzgerald sold for $7.5 million, the highest price for a home in the town in four years.The six-bedroom, 11,600-square-foot home, known as “La Vieille Maison” hit the market in March 2021 with an asking price of $10.5 million, Crain’s reported. It went into contract this week.The 5.2-acre estate was the 40th Chicago-area home to sell for $5 million or more this year, compared with 48 in 2021. The last time a home in Lake Forest, among Chicago’s affluent suburbs, sold for more was in 2018, when Nancy Hughes, the widow of 1980s filmmaker John Hughes, paid $12 million for a 3.4-acre property on nearby Mayflower Road.Originally built in 1888 for a Chicago map publisher, the Rosemary Road mansion was remodeled in 1910 for well-to-do newlyweds William and Ginevra King Mitchell. She inspired the character Daisy Buchanan in Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby.”Fitzgerald met King Mitchell, one of Chicago’s “Big Four” debutantes during World War I, when they were teenagers in his hometown of St. Paul, Minn. After he visited her at her parent’s home in Lake Forest, King Mitchell shifted her attention to the much wealthier Mitchell, the son of a local bank president.Fitzgerald went on to create characters in Gatsby and short stories that were based on King Mitchell. Another Gatsby character, Jordan Baker, was based on one of Chicago’s other “Big Four” debutantes, amateur golfer Edith Cummings.The Mitchell family owned the home until 1988. In 1995, a couple bought the home and used it on weekends. Before listing the home in 2007 and selling it in 2011, the pipes burst. A rehab firm bought the property for $2.25 million and sold it to the most recent owners for $5 million in 2013.— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",901 Rosemary Road

Erie Street (Trivago)Hilton Worldwide is no longer branding the Conrad Chicago hotel on the Magnificent Mile as its ownership faces a foreclosure lawsuit.The hotel brand exited its partnership with the 289-room property at 101 East Erie Street earlier this month, after the building closed in April 2020, Crain’s reported.The move was described by the company in a statement to Crain’s as an “amicable” termination of Hilton’s partnership with the property’s owner, a joint venture of hotelier Laurence Geller and Wanxiang America Real Estate Group, the outlet reported.It comes more than a year after the joint venture was served in a foreclosure lawsuit that alleges the partnership defaulted on its $70 million loan on the property, with the complaint still pending in Cook County court, according to Crain’s.The Conrad’s owners are far from alone in facing financial distress over Chicago hotel properties. Around 51 percent of the city’s hotels are at least 30 days delinquent or in special servicing, a step toward resolving a debt, often by a sale, putting the city sixth in the nation, The Real Deal reported last month, citing Cred IQ, a firm that tracks commercial mortgage-backed debt.Chicago’s hotels have been recovering from the pandemic at a slower pace than the national average, hobbled by a sluggish comeback for trade shows and business travel, which account for as much of a fifth of downtown hotel bookings in a typical year, The Real Deal reported this month.Downtown hotels ended 2021 at an average occupancy rate of 43 percent, up from 27 percent in 2020 and nowhere near the pre-pandemic rate of 74 percent, The Real Deal reported. Nationwide, the average was 58 percent compared with 66 percent in 2019.The partnership’s lender, Washington D.C.-based Union Labor Life Insurance, has been trying to sell the loan to prospective buyers to try to resolve the matter, Crain’s reported, citing sources familiar with the offering.The Conrad opened in 2016 following Geller and Wanxiang transforming former offices in the Erie Street structure into lodging. That was after it bought the offices of an advertising agency in 2014 for $34 million, Crain’s reported. The owners took out a $70 million loan in 2015, the outlet reported.Geller and Wanxiang also partnered in 2015 to buy the Waldorf Astoria Chicago hotel – which they later lost – in the Gold Coast for almost $112 million, then a record-high price paid for a hotel in the city, according to Crain’s. They turned over the property in 2019 to their lender, and it was sold in 2020 as hotels were being decimated by the pandemic for just less than $55 million to Joe Mansueta, a billionaire, Crain’s reported.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",101 E.

Other retailers include Ross Dress for Less, Dollar Tree, Staples and Royal Nail and Spa. The shopping center is at the intersection of Park Boulevard and Roosevelt Road. An average household living within a three-mile radius earns about $131,500, according to JLL, which represented the seller.“Investor appetite for value-add opportunities continues to increase as the market recovers from COVD and well-located centers continuing to see enhanced leasing velocity and tenant demand,” said JLL’s Amy Sands.As shoppers return to brick-and-mortar, US shopping centers have gained about 6 percent in value, according to Green Street Advisors, a California research firm. Retail centers anchored by grocery chains are considered less risky because most shoppers still tend to buy groceries in stores.Chicago’s largest retail property sale this year came in October when California investment firm LBX Investments paid $67 million for the Evergreen Plaza shopping center at 9500 to 9700 South Western Avenue.

The eastern portion is not for sale.Those four acres could be very appealing to a residential developer since the zoning allows for high-density apartment buildings, two-flats, townhomes or single-family homes, Crain’s reported. Over 40 homes have sold for $500,000-plus in Bronzeville over the last six months.At 170,000 square feet, it’s one of the largest properties to hit the market in Bronzeville in years. But Coldwell Banker’s David Olaoye, who has worked on some new development projects in Bronzeville, told Crain’s that the price point — at $44 a square foot — is not in line with past sales.Smaller properties in the area have been selling around $22 a foot, and one nearby 0.9-acre plot is listed at $36 a foot, according to Crain’s analysis.

11:00 AM","As tenants lose interest in unfinished offices amid soaring construction costs and delays, demand for spec suites — offices designed, built and furnished by landlords on a hunch they’ll be appealing enough to lease — is exploding.","[""From left: A photo illustration of 515 North State Street and Accenture Tower (LoopNet, FiveOneFive, iStock)As tenants lose interest in unfinished offices amid soaring construction costs and delays, demand for spec suites — offices designed, built and furnished by landlords on a hunch they’ll be appealing enough to lease — is exploding.It’s a big shift from the pre-Covid market. When downtown Chicago office brokers Melissa Rubenstein and Anna Panici started showing spec suites in 2015, the idea was similar to a model home.JLL’s Managing Director Melissa Rubenstein (LinkedIn/Melissa Rubenstein)“They were meant to show the tenant what could be done in the building, what the frames and finishes and palettes looked like, so they could take the building’s specs and build something out themselves,” JLL’s Rubenstein told The Real Deal.Spec offices are no longer showrooms. Instead, landlords are building dozens of them throughout buildings in order to make it easier for tenants to quickly move in.“All of our clients are actively in the spec suite game,” Rubenstein said. “They didn’t used to be as elaborate and ready to go as they are today.”She and Panici have leased about 85,000 square feet of spec offices this year across downtown buildings whose landlords they represent, including the Beacon Capital Partners and Ivanhoe Cambridge-owned 515 North State Street, where the firm RealtyAds just snagged a spot.“So many prospects don’t want to deal with the whole planning process,” said Chicago broker Wendy Katz of Stream Realty.Stream Realty’s EVP Wendy Katz (Stream Realty)Her firm leased 150,000 square feet of spec suites in the past three years, including several deals at her client KBS’ West Loop property, Accenture Tower. Stream has deals for another 70,000 square feet of spec suites that were just slightly tweaked by tenant requests, she said, and more are under construction.“We usually build out a handful at a time, different square footages, slightly different layouts,” she said.As office demand remains muted in general by the pandemic, landlords across the entire Chicago market, from downtown towers to single-story suburban offices, are pouring cash into building more spec suites. Some kicked off interior construction plans just before the health crisis, and a host of real estate market factors fueled by Covid has accelerated the spec frenzy.Landlords say having a completed product to show prospective tenants helps convince them that perks that are being added to older buildings and ever more luxurious ones in new developments are worth the cost of a lease and preferable to fully remote work schedules. Building owners also find rolling out spec suites helps control their costs.“It’s costing our clients less than it would to give tenants an improvement allowance,” JLL’s Panici said.Spec suites have also grown in size, from a maximum of about 5,000 square feet three to five years ago to 10 times that size in some properties.“Now we’re getting calls from brokers all the time asking if there are 15,000 to 25,000 square feet of existing conditions or spec suites ready to go,” Katz said.Landlords working to turn around struggling suburban offices are relying on spec suites, too. Vancouver, Canada-based Adventus is refilling several buildings in its suburban office portfolio of 3 million square feet and has completed two dozen rent-ready suites, some 90 percent of which are leased or in negotiations, the company told The Real Deal.Even once-overlooked single-story office buildings are getting interest due to spec suite programs.ONE STORY LLC owner Jonathan Berger (LinkedIn/Jonathan Berger)Jonathan Berger, who spent $9 million in 2018 to buy a single-story, multi-tenant office building near O’Hare airport and put another $2 million into renovations and amenities, has taken the property to 90 percent full from 50 percent and increased gross rents to $27 per square foot annually from $18. Each suite has its own entrance to make the property less prone to Covid transmission than towers with common areas and shared elevators, he said.“The other huge advantage is I’m saving $10 to $20 a square foot by not getting the tenant involved in construction,” Berger said. “The spaces that tenants are involved in designing cost probably about 20 percent more.”Granted, Chicago’s downtown sublease market, which has swelled to a record 6.3 million square feet, poses a direct challenge to spec suites. Because they’re being offered by former tenants, subleases usually rent at a discount, making the secondary market attractive to firms that want a low-cost option and perhaps a short-term commitment to a space ready for an immediate move-in.“Subleases, absolutely we compete with those,” Katz said.Yet spec suites offer more flexible terms than the traditional 10-year minimum. Katz said KBS wants a minimum of five-year spec suite leases at Accenture in most cases, while other landlords have allowed three years and Berger even offers one-year leases, with a rate hike for renewals.“I will do one-, two- and three-year deals, and I find my tenants tend to be sticky,” Berger said.The pandemic-induced shift in office designs – more gathering areas than private office space, fewer desks for individual work that’s increasingly remote — also dampens sublease demand compared to spec suites.“These subleases in many cases need a lot of work,” Katz said.The rise of the spec suite has also added new duties for the brokers representing landlords, who now play a more direct role in shaping a building’s finishes, just as the layouts of offices are shifting.“Anna and my job as leasing agents has completely evolved during Covid,” Rubenstein said. “Now we have to wear an architect hat, an interior designer hat and we have to nail it, we have to get it right.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",515 North State Street

But that group filed for bankruptcy after the DeGraff-led investor team bought the building’s debt and foreclosed in 2015, according to Crain’s.Redevelopment on the 32,000-square-foot building could be hampered somewhat by landmark restrictions. The 144-year-old building is on the National Register of Historic Places. There is also a 99-year lease with McDonald’s for a restaurant on the first and second floors, in which the burger chain pays just $1 in annual rent.But the property’s office tenants have only short-term leases remaining, and DeGraff said he has received numerous inquiries about the property from developers in the past few years.\xa0[Crain’s]\xa0 —John O’BrienAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",36 West Randolph Street

The village of Bellwood bought the 73,000-square-foot site and contributed the land to the $30 million housing project.The development will be a four-story building with 76 one-bedroom and four two-bedroom “independent living” apartments for seniors with incomes at or below 60 percent of the area’s median income of $63,000. Monthly rent rates are set to range from $775 to $1,100.The building will include on-site laundry, community and storage rooms, parking and intercom entry systems. Block estimates construction should be completed in July 2023 and contribute to the limited supply of affordable housing in the Chicago area.“Like the rest of the country, the Chicago area has a severe shortage of affordable housing, and options are especially limited for seniors who are living on a fixed income,” he said. “For them, communities like Bellwood are a lifeline that allows them to be part of a community close to family and friends.”Further west, in Aurora, the city set aside $400,000 of its Community Development Block Grant funds to renovate a senior housing development in the former Aurora Hotel. The property transformed from an historic former hotel into affordable senior housing in 1996. Now, with the pandemic driving down the development’s occupancy rate, it needs funds from the city to make necessary upgrades.[CBJ] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",542 25th Avenue

01:05 PM",Chicago’s downtown rents are jumping again.,"[""(iStock / Photo illustration by Priyanka Modi)Chicago’s downtown rents are jumping again.Rents in the downtown area continue to climb, while other cities are still rebounding from pandemic departures, data show.The average rent in Chicago was $2,332 a month in January 2022. That’s an increase of 6.1 percent from that time last year, according to data from Redfin.Residential rental buildings rebounded quickly from the pandemic, said Gail Lissner, managing director at Integra Realty Resources.The findings show a market where the market can’t keep up with the demand for rental housing, while the condo market lags behind. Also, residents looking to move downtown tend to want modern units, while most of the condo inventory is more dated, larger and requires a down payment, said Lissner. In the suburbs, it’s the opposite, with higher demand for single family homes.“Our rental market is so strong,” she said. “It was impacted for a short time by COVID, but by January 2021 it had popped back. Absorption has been great and occupancy has been great, there’s a tremendous appetite for rental buildings downtown.”Mortgage payments for condos in Chicago, even those with only a 5 percent down payment, are significantly lower, at an average of $954 a month. That drops even further to an average of $803 when the buyer has a 20 percent down payment.Class A apartment building rents jumped 32 percent last year, according to Integra Realty Resources. Not only have rents recovered everything they lost during the pandemic, they are hitting new highs, Integra told Crain’s Chicago. Tenants who could have previously been able to afford a downtown apartment may be left looking elsewhere in the city.“A lot of people are absolutely priced out of the market,” Integra Senior Managing Director Ron DeVries told Crain’s.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic never had the impact on residential real estate that it had on offices in downtown Chicago.Multifamily developers are pursuing new projects in other parts of the city to meet the demand. Fulton Market, which lifted a residential zoning ban, last year is set to get a slew of multifamily development in the coming years.

He was charged in an 11-count indictment, and allegations include stealing his ill mother’s identity to qualify for a $46,000 car loan. He pleaded not guilty and is free on bond.For years, his yacht was a fixture at the Playpen boating party scene off the shore in downtown Chicago. It included a pink stripper pole and became a floating party with loud music.Izsak purchased Flying Lady for $450,000 in 2011. He allegedly obtained $360,000 for the yacht by falsifying his income, submitting fraudulent tax returns and lying about loans he’d taken out on his home in Chicago’s Near West Side.A bank account with about $100,000 was also seized with other items in 2017.

The home had been listed for $1.99 million, well under the $2.25 million he was asking three years ago and the $3.1 million he expected in 2016. Pippen and his then-wife bought the house in 2004 for $2.23 million.The \u200b\u200bhome sits on 2.6 acres and comes with two master suites, a basketball court with an oversized painting of Pippen’s Bulls jersey, a movie theater, sauna and pool. Pippen and his then-wife Larsa added a gym and an infinity pool with a slide and waterfall. Other features of the home include fireplaces, a grand foyer, a large recreation room, a wine cellar, an updated kitchen and an eight-car garage.In an effort to find a buyer, Pippen listed his home on Airbnb in July, asking for three separate one-night stays for $92 each to honor the Olympics gold medal he won in 1992..While Pippen took a loss on the property, he’s been more successful than Michael Jordan, another former Chicago Bulls player. Jordan has been trying to find a buyer for his Highland Park nine-bedroom home for almost a decade.Jordan first listed the home in 2012 at $29 million. The six-acre compound with No. 23 emblazoned on the entrance gate has gone through a series of price cuts.

Dubin, who designed the house for his family in 1949, included a large wall of gridded windows overlooking the ravine. “You felt like you could literally reach out and touch the trees,” Grossman continued.The first home Dubin designed for his family was the landmark Battledeck House, which was built in 1930, also in Highland Park. That property is currently on the National Register of Historic Places. Dubin also designed a number of midcentury high- and mid-rises on Marine Drive, in the Loop and in South Shore.2350 Maple Lane in Highland Park (VHT Studios)The Maple Lane house, where Dubin lived until his death in 1963, has an exterior of steel, stone and marble and an interior with marble walls, white oak trimming and slate and cork floors.The Dubin family sold the home in 1964 and that buyer kept the home for four decades before Grossman purchased it for $600,000 in 2004.When she bought the home, much of the interior wall panels were falling off and the kitchen still had its original 1949 fixtures. Grossman decided to renovate the home while trying to “stay true to Dubin’s use of natural materials.”The exterior marble has been replaced with a more winter-resilient stucco and the kitchen and interior climate systems were also updated. Part of the renovation included removing carpet, which exposed the original cork floors. Some of the original slate floors had to be removed to update the house’s heating system, but Grossman replaced them with polished concrete.The house sits on just over half an acre on a short lane with few other houses.

The six-bedroom home sold in an off-market deal and the buyers haven’t been identified yet.The 12,280-square-foot home sits on more than 20 acres, next to the city’s most expensive home on record: a 12-bedroom, 14,145-square-foot Glanworth Gardens mansion that Chicago billionaire J. Christopher Reyes and his wife, Anne, spent $36 million on in January of this year. The estate of late investment manager Richard Driehaus was the seller behind that home.The sellers of Villa Hortensia, Ralph and Sally MacDonald, bought it in 1997 for a price that couldn’t be determined. They first listed the mansion for $20.75 million in May 2021 and later dropped the ask to $18.5 million.After the home remained unsold, the MacDonalds took it off the market and were later approached by real estate agent Wendy Murphy of d’aprile properties with an offer from the unidentified buyers.Villa Hortensia was built in the Mediterranean style for Edward Swift of the Swift meatpacking family and named for his wife, Hortense. Its features include a stucco exterior, a red Spanish tile roof and 11 bathrooms.The home has a domed entry hall on the first floor, a grand vaulted hallway on the second and original woodwork and oak floors throughout. Outside, there is a clay tennis court, in-ground swimming pool and original outbuildings that include a three-bedroom guest house. Along the 502 feet of level lakefront there are two piers and a private boat launch.It’s unclear whether the buyers of the vintage home, which is in desperate need of repairs, will invest money into major renovations, or — given the extent of the age and decay — send in a wrecking ball and start from scratch.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",3415 Snake Rd

Expanding an ordinance passed almost a decade ago and updated incrementally since then, it extends the geographical range of the city’s incentives.Building near transit is a “critical strategy to keep Bronzeville an economically diverse and attractive neighborhood, said P3 Markets Principal Phil Beckham, who is developing 43 Green along with The Habitat Co. The project will offer 50 affordable housing units and 49 market-rate ones with direct access to downtown via the Green Line.Under the ordinance, developers can build with an increased floor area ratio, which compares total floor area with the size of the land on which it’s built. Other incentives include a reduced minimum lot area, meaning developers may build more dwelling units on a particular parcel, and increased maximum building height. All those lead to higher profitability.Qualifications include building no more than one parking space per dwelling unit. Also, for each additional unit built, the developer must include an affordable unit.The ordinance makes those incentives available to development within a four-block radius – up from two blocks – from bus and rail stations and two blocks from “high-frequency and strategic bus corridors,” according to the city.Since the city first adopted its 2013 “Transit Served Location” ordinance, the majority of the development spurred by that legislation has bypassed the city’s South and West sides, according to the ordinance, supported by Beckham and Habitat’s Charlton Hamer.The development is the neighborhood’s first that’s part of Chicago’s Equitable Transit-Oriented Development Pilot Program, which grew out of the city’s eTOD Policy Plan. The ordinance implements a number of recommendations from that plan.Another city that has recently made an effort to prioritize transit-oriented development is Riverhead, New York, is making moves to revitalize the area around its train station.– Rachel HerzogAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Walton Street had been a junior lender on the $112 million acquisition loan Geller and Wanxiang secured in 2015 for the purchase.The deal with Mansueto for the 60-story hotel will wipe out Walton’s equity in the building plus about 20 percent of the $67 million loan that Wells Fargo originated for the 2015 purchase, according to the report. Wells will also provide the debt for Mansueto’s acquisition; Lodging Capital Partners is a minority investor in the venture.Among his holdings, Mansueto owns the Wrigley Building — which he acquired for $255 million in 2018 — along with the 297-unit Belden-Stratford apartments, which he bought for $106 million the same year.Recent appraisals have slashed hotel values, including the Palmer House Hilton and the 610-room JW Marriott, according to Crain’s.

MedMen had tried to prevent its landlord’s suit from moving to a state court by filing a separate lawsuit, arguing that marijuana’s federally illegal status prevents Thor from being able to enforce a lease. Attorneys representing MedMen and Thor didn’t return requests for comment.The case demonstrates the quandaries that can arise for cannabis businesses landlords. It’s a growing industry that is gaining greater legitimacy but remains under a patchwork of varying state and federal regulations.Thor sued MedMen earlier this year for nearly $1 million in unpaid rent at 942-944 West Fulton Street. The dispensary leased the space for more than two years and owed more than $950,000 for failing to pay the base rent of $70,727, operating costs of $2,667 and insurance costs of $556 for 11 months, according to the landlord’s initial complaint.The dispensary inked a 15-year lease for the 23,000-square-foot warehouse style space in August 2019, months before Illinois legalized marijuana on Jan. 1, 2020. The lease provided for an annual rent of $800,000, to increase each year to $1.2 million in the fifteenth year.MedMen’s subsequent filing doesn’t dispute that the business hasn’t paid rent since before August 2021 and surrendered the premises at 942-944 West Fulton Street to Thor Equities in February.This isn’t the first time Thor has sued a cannabis business over unpaid rent. The High Times dispensary had to pay the firm $4.9 million as a result of a lawsuit from Thor, though the business never opened in San Francisco.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",944 West Fulton Street

The special-purpose entity named in the lease is responsible for it, not Industrious itself. The entity offered $14,000 to the landlord to settle the outstanding rent because it “effectively had no assets,” the complaint states.Industrious took over the space when it acquired Assemble, a co-working provider that initially signed the lease for the building’s first floor in 2014.Industrious spokesman Corey Chambliss declined to comment on specifics of the lawsuit but told Crain’s the location “was a legacy leased unit that came to us via an acquisition and as such, we made the difficult decision to shut it down.”Industrious is known for signing management agreements with its landlords to operate flexible office spaces, while its co-working competitors would sign traditional leases. The Industrious business model allows landlords to share the benefits of co-working, along with the risk that comes along with it.Stockbridge alleges in the complaint that when Industrious took over the space from Assemble, the company led the landlord to believe Industrious itself “would be financially responsible for the lease’s assignment,” even though the special-purpose entity was named on the lease.The suit also accuses Industrious of telling its users at the Jackson Boulevard location to work from other nearby spaces, effectively draining income at Stockbridge’s property.Industrious is reportedly going public sometime in 2021, and has been rapidly expanding during the pandemic. In October, the company said 600,000 square feet of new space has opened or was announced to open this year.The company has seven downtown Chicago locations, including a new 52,000-square-foot space at Willis Tower that is set to open early next year.[Crain’s] — Akiko MatsudaAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",600 West Jackson Boulevard

The new tenant will be a sensory experiential retail destination at 820 North Orleans Street involving the quintessential material of Nickelodeon game shows viewers: slime.Sloomoo’s sensory experiential retail destinationSloomoo hired artists and experts in the design and music industries to build out spaces where youth and adults alike can play with features and activities such as slime waterfalls, interactive mirrors, augmented reality moments and do-it-yourself slime kitchens that let patrons create their own slime dishes and sculptures.The tenant exemplifies the kind of retailers Chicago officials and real estate players have said are important to multiply across the city to backfill empty storefronts in both the Loop and the Magnificent Mile, which has a vacancy rate of nearly 30 percent on a stretch of North Michigan Avenue. Such tenants establish new draws for families and young people that would feed potential customers to the nearby shops and restaurants.The addition of interactive art museum Color Factory at Willis Tower during the pandemic was touted by Loop retail broker John Vance of Stone Real Estate as a strong example of a smart wager on urban experiential retail amid the health crisis that has devastated other merchants reliant on crowds of office workers.“That got done and it opened in Covid, so that is a hats-off deal to the landlord, the brokers at CBRE and the tenant,” Vance said. “You’re making a bet that at some point the density [of office workers] and traffic is going to return. We believe in these tourist attractions.”In River North, the retail scene has proven more resilient and faster to start its recovery than other neighborhoods, as its smaller dependence on officer workers than the Loop gave it a leg to stand on during the crisis. Sloomoo tapped Demetrios Comodromos of Method Design architects to bring its new Chicago destination to life ahead of its November opening. Sloomoo also struck a new 28,000-square-foot lease to open a new location in Atlanta and is reopening in 12,000 square feet in New York at 475 Broadway later this month.Lasky and Peretz have been active real estate players in River North since the 1980s, and with Spectrum have assembled a portfolio of seven loft office buildings totaling 800,000 square feet, and 820 North Orleans is 155,000 square feet, according to the company’s website.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",820 North Orleans Street

The majority of the site, though, serves as a surface parking lot.Antunovich Associates is designing the new 14-story building proposed for the site. The facade will be a mix of brick and glass to fit in with the surrounding buildings in the West Loop. Its units will range in size from studios, multiple different one-bedroom options and two-bedroom units. Lendlease will serve as general contractor and Atlas Industries has been hired for the demolition.In addition to the residential portion, the development will also include 2,500 square feet of retail on the ground floor that fronts the intersection of West Van Buren and South Jefferson streets on the western edge of the property.The building will include a fitness center, co-working space, rooftop deck with pool and ground-floor dog run and spa as resident amenities. There will be parking for 76 vehicles and 99 bicycles.The project is being developed as an as-of-right development, meaning the proposed development fits under the site’s existing zoning rights. That means the developers are able to move forward with demolition and construction without formal city approval.The estimated date of completion for the project hasn’t been determined yet.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",566 West Van Buren Street

The facility marked the first coworking space for the company in Chicago and its ninth in the U.S. overall.“It’s an arms race for amenities,” James O’Reilly, president of Life Time work, told The Real Deal in May. “Some of the older inventory is really working hard to try and create more of a draw.

Ontario Street closes, buyer Strategic Properties of North America would set the record for the priciest condo deconversion in Chicago, according to Crain’s. It would break the current record of $107 million that was set in late 2019, when ESG Kullen bought a 391-unit condo in the Gold Coast.Strategic Properties also developed the 51-story Ontario Place condo tower.The owners of Ontario Place approved the sale in a vote on Sept. 10. The deal still faces some opposition from a small minority of owners who claim the entire sales process has been rigged, according to the report.In 2019, Chicago enacted an ordinance aimed at slowing what had been a rush of condo deconversion deals. Under the measure, at least 85 percent of owners had to approve a building’s bulke sale, up from the previous 75 percent.Ontario Place owners had rejected an August 2020 offer from Strategic of $188 million. At that time, only 74 percent of owners voted to approve the deal.The latest vote had just under 90 percent of the owners voting to approve while a little under 9 percent voting against.The opposition, led by Mark Silverberg, claims the building’s condo board acted “improperly” by pushing for the sale, Crain’s reported. He and a group of supporters sued the board last year over the planned deal.Silverberg also contends the condo board improperly extended the voting deadline, which allowed more owners time to vote. That ended up raising the percentage of owners in favor of selling, from nearly 84 percent.An attorney representing the board said it was not the board’s decision, but the condo owners themselves who chose to extend the voting deadline.[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","10 E.

The estate also has a four-bedroom guesthouse, an orchard and 621 feet of lake frontage.The second-priciest home in the area was a 40,000-square-foot mansion at Stone Manor that sold for $13.5 million in 2017, followed by a 13,000-square-foot house on South Lake Shore Drive that transferred hands at $12.75 million last year.The home next door to Glanworth Gardens has a listing price of $20.75 million, the second-highest listing price in the area.

02:11 PM","GW Properties cashed in on a medical office property the firm built at Chicago’s busy Six Corners intersection, selling the two-story building to another local real estate player for more than $16 million.","[""GW Properties’ Mitch Goltz and 3950 North Milwaukee Avenue (GW Properties, Google Maps)GW Properties cashed in on a medical office property the firm built at Chicago’s busy Six Corners intersection, selling the two-story building to another local real estate player for more than $16 million.Oak Brook’s Inland Real Estate Group paid $16.3 million for the property at 3950 North Milwaukee Avenue, Cook County records show. Advocate Medical Group is the tenant and started providing services at the location in August, according to published reports.GW’s Mitch Goltz said the deal and other recent sales in the Portage Park neighborhood on the northwest side is a testament to the area’s strength. Historically a shopping district, the area has seen increased residential density in recent months.“We have been very bullish as a company on this area for quite some time,” Goltz said.The intersection is unique because it boasts several large properties primed for repositioning, including another nearby for which GW is pursuing a large redevelopment, he said.“It’s created a lot of opportunities for the market to speak to what the demands and needs are to fill,” Goltz said.Medical offices have figured prominently into transformations of urban areas that were more exclusively shopping districts as brick and mortar retail faced challenges across the nation, and the Chicago area’s addition of medical offices has outpaced other large cities over the past decade.Goltz declined to share the property’s full development costs. Inland didn’t return a request for comment on the deal.GW is the latest firm to take advantage of elevated property values as multifamily developers move into the area. Northbrook-based Pine Tree sold a 40,000-square-foot retail strip on the Six Corners intersection to San Diego-based Realty Income for $12.6 million over the summer, a $5 million valuation increase over its last sale.Earlier this year, the Chicago City Council approved Novak Construction’s redevelopment of the former Sears store at 4730 West Irving Park Road into a six-story, 207-unit apartment building. Across the street, a $130 million project by Clark Street Real Estate and Ryan Companies to build a 10-story, 258-unit senior housing complex is scheduled for completion later this year.GW is also playing a major role in establishing the area’s new real estate makeup. The firm’s Shops at Six Corners project at 3955 North Kilpatrick Avenue would turn a former warehouse into 110 apartments and five retail buildings. Goltz said that project is still in the planning stages, after an initial proposal for the site was met with some unfavorable comments by local residents.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",3950 North Milwaukee Avenue

Its offering represents a test of the market for offices as companies settle into having employees clock in at a physical workplace just three or four days a week while the pandemic wanes and remote work remains popular.Properties in downtown Chicago have seen their valuations slashed by millions in some cases as tenants left or downsized their physical footprints amid the pandemic-fueled rise of remote work.Similar decisions are being made by some suburban office tenants as their leases expire, leaving buildings with space to fill, a task complicated by the convenience of remote work for many companies.The Evanston property last changed hands in 2011 when Franklin bought it for $35 million, and before that it moved in 2003 for $34 million, public records show.The property “offers unparalleled access to transportation in a highly sought-after urban-suburban environment,” Newmark’s Jim Postweiler said.Its tenants include Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Industrious, Aptinyx, North Shore University Health, Merrick Pet Care, Medpoint Digital and Athletico. It is 93 percent leased, Crain’s reported.Evanston, home to Northwestern University, hasn’t seen a large office building sold since the end of 2018, when a 10-story, 127,000 square-foot property sold for more than $32 million, public records show.While investors have been bullish on Evanston offices in the past, the market’s pace slowed amid the pandemic. Last year, an office building at 1007 Church Street was put on the market and never sold, Crain’s reported.Along with Postweiler, Newmark’s Peter Harwood, Derek Fohl and Jack Trager are representing the seller.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",45 million by Massachusetts-based owner Franklin Street

The four-building, 23-acre industrial and office complex is located at 2500 West Bradley Place in the northern part of the city.The campus runs along the banks of the North Branch of the Chicago River and is 96 percent leased. Tenants of the complex include RCN of Chicago, multiple medical offices and other recreational businesses such as IK Gymnastics, Windy City Ninjas and Goldfish Swim School. About $5.9 million is collectively generated in annual net operating income from all of the tenants.The owners of the property paid $8.3 million for the site in 2006. At that time the property consisted of three vacant buildings on the western portion of the campus. The owners secured leases over the 15 years and refinanced the property with a $14 million mortgage. The deal with Hines comes out to $210 per square foot.Another joint venture paid $6.25 million for the 355,000-square-foot building on the eastern part of the property in 2010. After leasing most of the space to more than a dozen tenants, the venture refinanced the building with a $23.4 million loan.In addition to the already-secured income, the zoning for the campus also allows for as much as 1.6 million square feet of new development.

The firm made $500 million of unsolicited offers for dozens of suburban Chicago condo properties in recent months, said Iman Jalali, one of Bear Peak’s leaders along with Michael Pouliot and Scott Skinger.While it’s unlikely that the firm gains enough traction to reel in purchases of most of those properties, the bullish approach to suburban condos primed to turn into rentals reflects Chicago’s surging multifamily market. Investment firm Albion recently set a record with the almost $140 million purchase of a suburban Palatine apartment complex.“Once that offer reaches the condo board members, you have no idea how they’re going to respond,” Jalali said. “All we’re looking for is a foot in the door.”To pull off a deconversion, buyers have to get condo unit owners who together control at least 75 percent of a property’s value to vote in support in an election held by the property’s condo association board. Owners against selling are overridden and forced to sell if that vote meets the threshold. In Chicago, the threshold rose to 85 percent in 2019, turning investor attention to suburban assets since the lower bar remains intact outside the city.Bear Peak uses property records to focus on condo complexes with high sales volumes before the Great Recession cooled a Chicagoland market that had been overheating.Property values on many of those units never fully recovered. While condo owners who bought at the peak are likely to be seeking to get out from underwater mortgages, others who bought at the bottom of the market often also want to cash in by accepting deconversion offers, which can net sellers 20 percent more than an individual condo unit would get on the market.Bear Peak hunts for properties that have a high concentration of unit owners who bought at either of those points.Rental rate growth in Chicago has been strong enough that deconversion investors can offer condo owners premiums, since their buildings as a whole are worth more as rentals than individual condo units.The political nature of getting condo owners’ approval intimidates some investors who would make traditional apartment investments without the headache of campaigning for a hyperlocal election to complete acquisitions. When holdout unit owners refuse to accept a deal, the process can get contentious, litigious and lengthy, so there is a limited pool of deconversion buyers.“You have to communicate and educate the current unit owners on what the offer means,” Jalali said. “\u200b\u200bIf you have that down, and you know the right properties to target, it’s not as scary.”UPDATE, 7/29/2022, 7:45am: This article has been corrected to fix references to Bear PeakAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1669 Ishnala Drive

The project has $3 million in loans from others.Funding the project is also being helped by a donation from Vince Foglia, who founded medical products company Sage Products in the medical district in 1971, according to Crain’s, which reported Chicago Lighthouse President and CEO Janet Szlyk declined to disclose the gift amount.Developers could break ground later this year and the project is set for completion in 2024, Crain’s reported.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1134 South Wood Street

O’Neil via Flickr and iStock)Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Wednesday threw cold water on the growing number of proposals to increase the costs of buying and selling property in the city in order to address a variety of needs.So far three different plans have been introduced in the City Council to raise the property transfer tax — one calling for a 160 percent hike — but Emanuel came out against them, saying homeowners are “not an ATM machine,” according to the Chicago Sun-Times.Emanuel, who as mayor led the Council in approving $2 billion in tax increases and higher water and sewer bills, said the city should “try everything else” before raising the transfer tax.“I think that’s a mistake,” he said. “I think it will actually impact other things economically that affect the well being of the city.”Aldermen recently have floated an increase in the tax on properties over $1 million to fight homelessness and another on properties over $750,000 to replace lead water pipes. Alderman Matt O’Shea (19th) on Wednesday introduced a proposal to hike the transaction tax by 27 percent for police and fire pensions.While the number of luxury homes to change hands has been breaking records lately, the median sales price has been on the decline since 2015, a phenomenon some experts blamed in part on soaring taxes.

The company’s lease at the 44-story West Loop building runs through June 2031.Since the start of the pandemic, companies have reduced their office footprints as remote work became the norm. While the growth of sublease availability slowed last year with offices hopeful that employees would return, available subleases for offices in the central business district was still about 83 percent more than when the pandemic began in early 2020, according to brokerage CBRE.Motorola hasn’t said why it listed part of its office or whether employees working downtown will move to its suburban office in Schaumburg, the company’s previous headquarters. In 2015, Motorola announced it would relocate its main office to the West Loop, joining a flurry of suburban companies heading to the city to acquire tech-savvy talent. The company opened up its 150,000 square feet of office space on six floors the following year.Taking over leases has been an attractive option for new tenants in the city looking for a move-in ready workspace at bargain prices as rents in Chicago remain little changed despite record vacancy rates. Recently, marketing software company Braze took over a 50,000 square foot lease at 1 North State Street from another software company, Showpad. An influx of Class A buildings offering amenities and the rising cost of raw materials have kept rents stuck at pre-pandemic levels.Buildings that are offering office space for sublease include 141 West Jackson Boulevard, 125 South Wacker Drive, and 1330 West Fulton Street. HomeAdvisor recently put its 31,000-square-foot office at Merchandise Mart at 222 North LaSalle Street on the market, according to CoStar Group.[Crain’s] – Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",500 West Monroe Street

Matt Martin, Maria Hadden and Daniel La Spata are supporters of Chicago’s real estate transfer tax (Facebook, sarah-ji from midwest, usa, CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons, Getty)Supporters of an initiative to more than triple Chicago’s real estate transfer tax on deals for $1 million or more to fund initiatives to battle homelessness hit a setback Monday as a special meeting on the proposal fell one alderman short of a quorum.A group of advocates, including city council progressives, are pushing to significantly hike real estate transfer taxes on property sales of $1 million or more, for both commercial and residential trades. The additional tax revenue, which the group estimated at $163 million annually, would go toward city programs providing housing for Chicago’s homeless population.The campaign, called Bring Chicago Home, would put the question to voters in February’s municipal election, if it can garner enough support from council members for the measure to be sent to the ballot.That looks less likely to happen unless the proposal undergoes some tweaks, though, after aldermen declined to show up for the meeting, indicating some were hesitant to express either support or opposition for it as written.Ald. Daniel La Spata of the First Ward said in a tweet the campaign “would be a transformative measure to end homelessness in the city, yet 25 alders couldn’t even come to a City Council meeting to discuss it.”Mayor Lori Lightfoot attended the initial meeting at 9 a.m., but missed the session when the council reconvened later in the day in another unsuccessful attempt to get a quorum to discuss the transfer tax hike proposal. Lightfoot has said she opposes sending the measure to voters.A spokeswoman for the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, which supports the measure, told The Real Deal that proponents of the proposal were “regrouping” after the hearing’s cancellation.Both commercial and residential real estate associations in Chicago oppose the idea. Leadership at BOMA/Chicago, a trade association for 240 commercial buildings in the city, has said the proposal was made at a bad time, with inflation and rising interest rates slowing or evaporating commercial real estate deals. Neighborhood Building Owners Alliance member Sean Easton said the tax hike would stymie growth and hurt small to medium-sized housing providers.“They’re working to run businesses that are affordable for these tenants and there’s always some new policy being thrown at them that makes it harder for them to do their job,” Easton said.A Los Angeles voters referendum to increase real estate transfer taxes to fight homelessness was on track to pass last week as election results rolled in, though that initiative would only impact sales of residential properties valued at $5 million or more with a 4 percent tax that would increase to 5.5 percent on deals of $10 million or more.Chicago’s current transfer tax rate charges buyers $3.75 for every $500 of a deal’s value and seller’s pay $1.50 for every $500. The city enacted a transfer tax in 1974 and it comes on top of a state of Illinois transfer tax of 50 cents for every $500 of a deal’s value and a Cook County tax of 25 cents for every $500.[contactauthor email=”[email\xa0protected]” text=”Contact Rachel Herzog”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The sellers, San Francisco-based Stockbridge Capital Group took a steep loss on the 117,000-square-foot building, which it paid $23.5 million for in 2017, plus an additional $8 million in renovations.Chicago’s office market is suffering from a glut of vacant office space. As landlords try to find tenants in a post-pandemic environment where remote working models remain popular, rising interest rates and companies offering space on the sublease market have led to many property owners to sell office buildings assets at heavily discounted prices.The Jackson building is Farbman’s second deep-discount buy in the past 13 months. He also picked up the 25-story building at 100 North LaSalle Street for $16.4 million — half of what it sold for in 2016.Farbman’s newest building is half occupied, which is an improvement from the 62 percent vacancy rate it had when Stockbridge bought it. But it still presents a leasing challenge for the veteran investor.“We’re hopeful that our reset basis will allow us to capture the tenants that are now finding it more difficult to work remotely. We’re hoping to capture some of that demand with cool, well-located space,” Farbman told the outlet. “We believe that we can catch some of the tenants as they continue to migrate west, wanting to be close to Union Station, Ogilvie (Transportation Center) and highway exits, but not willing to pay the freight to move to Fulton Market.”Farbman said that he has seen smaller companies having more success in returning to the physical office, so his company tends to focus on smaller 5,000- to 20,000-square-foot spaces rather than 100,000- and 200,000-square-foot properties.— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",600 West Jackson Boulevard

The law firm will lease 105,000 square feet and move into the 1.5 million-square-foot building at 320 South Canal Street when it opens in early 2022, Crain’s reported.The firm is the product of a recent merger between Minneapolis-based Faegre Baker Daniels and Philadelphia-based Drinker Biddle & Reath. The two offices opening up amid the move are Drinker Biddle’s 112,000 square feet at 191 North Wacker Drive and FaegreBD’s 54,000 square feet at 311 South Wacker. The firms were the biggest tenants in those buildings.BMO Harris Bank, the namesake of the new building, will occupy 500,000 square feet in the building as part of a consolidation of its downtown Chicago offices. Financial services law firm Chapman & Cutler signed a 100,000-square-foot lease there.Co-developers Riverside Investment & Development and Convexity Properties broke ground on BMO Tower in December.Riverside is also co-developing another office tower at 110 North Wacker Drive, where it’s already attracted four other law firms relocating from elsewhere Downtown. A couple of other law firms have relocated to Riverside’s 54-story building 150 North Riverside Plaza since it opened in 2017.The trend doesn’t bode well for the Downtown office market, especially in the Central Loop, as companies are instead choosing to move to the booming West Loop and the southwest corner of the Loop near the redeveloped Old Post Office.

New York Life Insurance is also listed as having a role in the deal, though it is unclear whether it would be as a lender for Mansueto or an equity investor in the property, according to Crain’s.The tenant notices are typically part of the due diligence process in buying or financing a property.Spokespeople for the parties either could not be reached for comment or declined comment to Crain’s.The owners spent $70 million — with an assist from federal historic tax credits — renovating the connected towers and spent millions more leasing them up, raising occupancy from 35 percent overall to 93 percent for the south tower and 96 percent for the north. The biggest tenant is architects Perkins + Will at 60,000 square feet.Mansueto, whose net worth is $3 billion according to a Forbes estimate, founded Morningstar in 1984 and stepped down as its CEO in 2017. He also owns Mansueto Ventures, a New York-based company that publishes Fast Company and Inc. magazines.\xa0[Crain’s] — John O’BrienAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",410 North Michigan Avenue

The new construction will also have about 42,000 square feet of commercial space on the first and second floors of the buildings. Construction is expected to be completed in 2024.The project will also build 78 affordable units, consisting of studios, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three bedroom units, located on site to meet the city’s affordable housing requirements. It’s part of Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s initiative to increase the amount of required affordable housing units in new construction.Tuesday’s vote followed approvals by the Chicago Plan Commission in August and the city council’s Committee on Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards last week.The city council’s approval comes at a time when Chicago’s office vacancy rates are hitting record highs while occupancy rates in downtown apartments have been soaring.It’s a little too early to tell how the downtown rental and housing markets will look like in 2024, said Benjamin Creamer, principal of Downtown Apartment Company, but he remains optimistic.“Over the years, the downtown has been able to absorb new development and I think a lot of it is still driven by the job market,” said Creamer. Cramer noted that demand for rentals and condominiums have kept up over more than 10 years and the Loop is an attractive option for Chicagoans due to the proximity to an expressway, as well as the space it offers compared with other areas in downtown.In downtown Chicago, about 11,530 apartments will be delivered by the second quarter of 2023, according to a Marcus & Millichap’s market report.

Earlier this year, the embattled firm secured a $240 million refinancing for the 930,000-square-foot building from JPMorgan Chase.The new debt was securitized into several CMBS transactions, including the single-asset deal known as JPMCC 2020-LOOP. Documents associated with the securitization provide an inside look at the property’s rent roll.As of last November, the tower was 88 percent leased to 29 tenants “across the banking, government, technology, advertising and industrial sectors,” according to the loan prospectus.The largest tenant at the building, the Northern Trust Company, occupies more than 40 percent of the rentable space and pays $21.31 per square foot in annual base rent, the lowest rate among the building’s major tenants. 181 West Madison is connected by a sky bridge to Northern Trust-owned 50 South LaSalle across the street, and the two buildings jointly serve as the financial services firm’s headquarters.The tower also serves as the headquarters of its second- and third-largest tenants, consulting firm Quantitative Risk Management and Berkshire Hathaway’s Marmon Group, an industrial holding company.The fourth-largest tenant is a government agency, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which pays the priciest base rent among the building’s major tenants at $33.75 per square feet. The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce rounds out the top five with 42,000 square feet across the 35th and 36th floors.(Stacking plan for 181 West Madison Street.

The company was able to sell 123 Mission Street in San Francisco and City Center in Minneapolis in 2018, and sold 850 Third Avenue in Manhattan in early 2019 amid pressure from the U.S. government.Meanwhile, the conglomerate still owns most of its priciest trophy property, the $2.2 billion office tower at 245 Park Avenue in Manhattan, although SL Green acquired a roughly $150 million preferred equity stake in the property in 2018.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",181 West Madison Street

02:27 PM","Demand for Chicago offices is starting to emerge as the pandemic wanes, but new supply is growing faster — and staying empty.","[""320 South Canal St (320Southcanal)Demand for Chicago offices is starting to emerge as the pandemic wanes, but new supply is growing faster — and staying empty.The conundrum resulted in a new record-high vacancy rate of 21.2 percent in the city’s central business district — the second-largest in the nation — at the end of March, Crain’s reported, citing CBRE data. That’s up from 19.7 percent on Jan. 1, and the previous historic high of 20 percent set in the third quarter last year.The recent vacancy-rate hike was driven by new supply hitting the market rather than tenants pulling out of offices.The new 1.5 million-square-foot BMO Tower by Union Station, for example, was completed with almost half the building still available.Three other new developments are also still mostly empty. Office buildings at 400 North Aberdeen Street, 1045 West Fulton Street in Fulton Market and 609 West Randolph Street in the West Loop were all completed, adding a total of eight percent more space than was available at the end of 2021.Google is negotiating a lease for around 200,000 square feet in the Aberdeen building, showing that demand remains strong for the newest developments with rich amenities, but demand remains slack for older buildings in the Loop.“I can think of four of five [buildings] that have tenants competing for spaces, and on the flip side, there are a lot more buildings that will do anything to attract and retain tenants,” CBRE’s Mark Cassata told Crain’s. “I think as the market continues to develop, the have and have-not [gap] continues to expand.”Recent trades illustrate the difference. The building at 225 West Washington Street, which is 35 years old and 40 percent vacant, sold for about $83 million in February — less than the $85 million loan the sellers borrowed against the property in 2019. Meanwhile, a partnership between Chicago investor Tim Callahan and New York’s Oak Hill Advisors bought a stake in the 55-story Bank of America Tower completed in 2020 that valued the property at more than $1 billion — the city’s second highest-valuation for an office building behind only Willis Tower.Leasing activity was far from dormant in the first quarter, though. Online consumer lender Avant doubled its downtown office space with an 80,000-square-foot lease at the Merchandise Mart. And Stripe, a San Francisco-based online payments company, leased 45,000 square feet at 350 North Orleans in an expansion from its office at a River North WeWork co-working spot.Big sublease offerings hit the market even as demand for new space started to tick up, though. Motorola Solutions listed 54,000 square feet at 500 West Monroe Street on the secondary market, and sports betting company Fubo Gaming, which was already on a sublease, is marketing its 30,000 square feet at 1 North Dearborn Street.Before the pandemic, the CBD’s vacancy rate was 13.8 percent, and new records were set in four of the past five quarters, Crain’s reported.[Crain’s] — Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",320 South Canal St

09:00 AM",Efforts by two Chicago suburbs to redevelop dilapidated shopping centers are confronting fiscal and municipal obstacles ranging from an owner’s delays to local qualms about meeting an affordable housing threshold.,"[""Northbrook Court and International Plaza (Google Maps)Efforts by two Chicago suburbs to redevelop dilapidated shopping centers are confronting fiscal and municipal obstacles ranging from an owner’s delays to local qualms about meeting an affordable housing threshold.In Northbrook, officials granted a second extension to Brookfield Properties, the owner of Northbrook Court, to revise its redevelopment plan for the mall. In Arlington Heights, officials are concerned that a proposal to turn a 1980s-era shopping plaza into apartments won’t integrate affordable units into the rest of them.Re-use can’t come soon enough for malls that in some cases date back decades. Schaumburg developer Urban Street Group wants to build a 302-unit apartment complex on the north side of Arlington Heights’ 1980s-era International Plaza and a commercial development with office and retail components on the south. The village has been trying to redevelop the property since 2002.“It’s dangerous over there,” said Arlington Heights Trustee Rich Baldino. “It’s falling down.”The struggles underscore the difficulty of bringing large, outdated shopping centers into the 21st century as suburban communities grapple with opportunities and challenges those properties present in a market starting to reset after two years of disruption.Arlington Heights tried to spur the redevelopment by putting the mall into a Tax Increment Funding District that it extended for 12 years in 2014. Over the years, a contract with another developer and an agreement with a major retailer have fallen through and the property has been the subject of numerous lawsuits, Charles Perkins, director of planning and community development for Arlington Heights, said at a village board meeting this week.“We work very hard to find solutions for challenging development sites,” Urban Street Group senior vice president Jon Dennis told the village board on Monday, acknowledging the many starts and stops efforts to redevelop the property have faced. “We think we have a great solution to make it happen.”Of the apartment units Urban Street proposed, 37 would be designated as affordable housing for seniors. While that tops the percentage required by the village’s inclusionary housing ordinance, some trustees said they were concerned about Urban Street’s plan to have those units built in a separate building by another firm, Northpointe Development Corporation. The ordinance calls for affordable units to be integrated with the rest of the units and built at the same time.The Urban Street plan allows the developer to fund the project with federal tax credits, without which it’s hard to build affordable housing, Dennis said.“My concern is that creates a situation where you are segregating your affordable housing,” said Village Trustee Mary Beth Canty. “It creates an incentive to put affordable housing in one area of the community and not intermingle it with the market rate,” raising questions about whether residents will have access to amenities,” she said.In Northbrook, officials approved $27 million in subsidies three years ago to overhaul Northbrook Court at 1515 Lake Cook Road, according to Crain’s. The village board voted last month to extend a deadline for the mall owner’s revised redevelopment plan to Dec. 23 from Aug. 1, the second time the board approved a shift in timing in as many years. A $250 million redevelopment plan that it signed off on in 2019 was delayed due to the pandemic.The developer behind Brookfield’s original redevelopment plan for Northbrook Court is Ryan Properties, the same company that Arlington Heights was at one time under contract with for a previously proposed redevelopment of International Plaza.In 2021, a group led by New York-based Brookfield stopped paying the $117 million remaining mortgage on the mall, leading lender Barings to shop for brokers to potentially sell the 1-million-square foot property. Northbrook Court was also among the malls that Cook County reported had skipped a property tax payment last year, and its vacancy rate has jumped as department stores and other smaller retailers have closed.Brookfield told Crains that it plans to finish what it started, without providing details. The firm recently repaid the mall’s $131 million loan from Barings.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1515 Lake Cook Road

The building will also have a fitness center, community rooms, bicycle storage and a rooftop deck.Two external fire escapes will be removed and a new interior stair will be added instead. The developers will also rebuild the existing boiler structure on the southern end of the property to allow for more space in the apartments and common areas. In addition, the masonry facade will be repaired and exterior windows will be replaced.MCM and Washington Park are financing the project with about $36.8 million from multiple sources. Funding will include $2.3 million in developer equity, $3 million in deferred developer fees, $6.3 million in Historic Tax Credits, $14.7 million in lender financing, $2.5 million in TIF funding, $3 million from a City Grant and $5 million in for funding the project as the joint venture “Community Interest Company.”While the developers haven’t filed any permits for the work, the council’s approval means work can begin.

The NHP Foundation, a non-profit real estate organization dedicated to preserving affordable housing, is leading the effort to renovate the property. The City Council’s approval will allocate city funds to NHP Foundation to complete the project, according to Chicago YIMBY.The property sits several blocks from Lake Michigan and currently includes 64 rooms that will be converted into 30 studio apartments. The apartments will be earmarked for tenants making between 30 and 50 percent of Lincoln Park’s Area Median Income of $100,000, according to Chicago YIMBY. The building’s current residents will be given preference if they choose to return once the renovation is completed.Additional renovations include turning the eight ground-floor retail spaces into four, as well as replacing the building’s doors, windows and elevators. The project will be financed through tax-exempt bonds, loans, tax credits, and city financing. The project was initially pitched in 2019, and little in the design has changed since then.Beyond the Covent renovation, the developer is proposing a new construction seven-story building adjacent to the hotel. Designed by Brininstool + Lynch, the project would incude ground-floor retail, a parking lot, and 84 units. The developer plans to pay almost $800,000 because only two of the units will be affordable. That $800,000 will go toward renovation costs of the Covent.The Covent Hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Built in 1915, it was one of Chicago’s residential hotels that were built during the early 1900s to house Chicago’s fast-growing working class population.[Chicago YIMBY] — Miranda DavisAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2653 N Clark Street

The 223,000-square-foot property is mostly vacant.It was sold by Acres Capital, which bought the building a year ago when its previous owners were facing a potential mortgage default.The office tenants still in the building will remain under Intersection’s conversion plan, yet a majority of the building will be converted into apartments. About 46 percent of the building is leased to office tenants, and Chavin said more than half of the building would likely be converted.Intersection plans to add a “rooftop amenity” to the building, he said. The total cost of the conversion will likely be greater than what the company paid for the building.Mayor Lori Lightfoot has invited developers to convert outdated office buildings on and near LaSalle Street into residential buildings in an effort to restore foot traffic in the Loop. The city is offering tax increment financing plans to temporarily freeze property tax increases on improvements, amongst other public incentives, to developers of these projects as long as at least 30 percent of the units are affordable.While the Wacker Place project is a few blocks east of LaSalle, Chavin said he plans to pursue historic tax credits for the 94-year-old building and request that Chicago designate the building a landmark, which would make it eligible for a Class L property tax incentive. The city has encouraged developers to take similar paths to gain financial viability for LaSalle Street residential conversions of offices.The Wacker Place building has 23 tenants. As many of them are smaller tenants with floor plates under 10,000 square feet, Intersection will likely have to move them to create a contiguous block of the building that can be redeveloped.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",65 East Wacker Place

It went into contract on Dec. 22 at a price of $665,000.2210 West Ohio Street (Redfin)The interior retains many design choices from the 1970s, when Lombardo was one of two men said to be running the Chicago crime syndicate’s business in Las Vegas. Many of the rooms feature busy wallpaper, some even on the ceilings, and brightly colored carpeting. The home’s television sports knotty pine paneling and a wood-tiled ceiling.Lombardo was convicted of murdering a federal witness in 2007, 33 years after the crime actually took place. He moved into the home where his wife lived with her parents, the Nigros. The sale will mark the first time in almost a century that the home will belong to a completely unrelated family.Lombardo, who was arrested and acquitted 11 times by the age of 32, got the nickname “the Clown” due to his habit of making crazy faces in his mugshots. In 1982, he and two others were convicted of bribing a US senator and Lombardo was sentenced to 15 years in prison. He also received a separate 10-year sentence for skimming more than $2 million from the proceeds of the Vegas casinos.Upon his parole in 1992, the 63-year-old Lombardo took out classified ads in the Chicago Tribune that proclaimed his innocence.“If anyone hears my name used in connection with any criminal activity,” the ads read, “please notify the FBI, local police and my parole officer, Ron Kumke.”Lombardo became a fugitive in 2005 when it was revealed that he had been implicated in the FBI’s investigation of 18 mob-related murders dating back to 1970. He was arrested in Elmwood Park, 10 miles from his Ohio Street home, after an international manhunt.He was convicted of multiple crimes, including racketeering, loan-sharking and a 1974 murder in Bensenville.Lombardo, who died 10 years into a life sentence, proclaimed his innocence in letters in his final days, according to ABC7 Chicago reporter Chuck Goudie.“I am Positively Not Guilty of all charges in the indictment,” Lombardo wrote, according to Goudie. “I rest my case Judge.”[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2210 West Ohio Street

Fulton Market, the report noted. That would be nearly 20 percent over what it paid developer Sterling Bay for the complex in 2016.Google, which occupies 387,000 square feet in the building, had been gobbling up Chicago office space leading up to the pandemic. In March 2020, it was set to more than double its local footprint, with space at four locations for a total of 1.3 million square feet.For ARA, the decision to sell comes at a time when the local office market vacancy rate hovers at 15.5 percent and some projections show it could rise to 18 percent by the end of 2022. Recent retreats from the market include a scrapped 1.2 million-square-foot office and residential complex along the Chicago River, across from Goose Island; and a West Loop warehouse owner’s abandoned plans for loft-style office conversion.At 1000 W. Fulton, Google’s lease runs through 2028. The property, known as 1K Fulton, is nearly completely leased, according to the report.

They came back with a revised plan to move the area’s southern boundary north to Randolph Street in an effort to sidestep residential properties.Revenue from an extra property tax in that area could be used to pay for surveillance cameras, more streetlights and extra snow removal services, proponents said.The neighborhood group needs to show it has support from at least 20 percent of affected property owners in order for the city to create a Special Service Area. If approved, the district would not go into full effect until the Kinzie tax increment financing district expires in 2022.

The deal for the 354,000-square-foot building at 263 Shuman Avenue was followed by the parties splitting the building from the land; Opal paid an unknown sum for the leasehold on the property, a move that extended its office buying spree in the Chicago area.Opal made deals last year to pick up the 50-story office tower at 35 West Wacker Drive in Chicago’s Loop for $415 million, and spent another $180 million on the Corporate 500 office campus in suburban Deerfield. Its purchase of the eight-story Highland Landmark II office building in suburban Downers Grove pushed its buying spree to a total of $650 million.The firm is betting that a rebound is in store for Chicago’s office market by taking on property like the Naperville building left by OfficeMax in 2015, even as the pandemic raises questions about the future of office demand. New leasing activity in Chicago so far has been concentrated on the newest developments with rich amenities, while vacancies hang near record highs both downtown and in suburban markets.Its optimism on the future suburban office market isn’t limited to Chicago. Opal spent $150 million on an Orange County, California office tower last year, too.The Naperville building’s sale provides an exit from the building for a venture of Chicago-based Franklin Partners and Northbrook-based Bixby Bridge Capital that bought the building while it was vacant in 2018, taking out a $21.7 million loan to acquire the property, Crain’s reported. Its previous owner handed the keys back to its lender on a $49 million loan, Crain’s reported, making it unclear how much the Franklin and Bixby venture paid to buy it from the special servicer appointed to oversee the troubled loan.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",263 Shuman Avenue

The firm took over the property in August 2021 after filing a $48.9 million foreclosure suit.The property could sell for as little as $30 million, which will be a loss for Torchlight as the property carries about $49 million in debt. Its appraised value also dropped significantly to $15.2 million in May of this year. The mall was appraised at $89.1 million in 2014.The shopping center is located at the corner of McCormick Boulevard and Touhy Avenue and like so many other similar businesses, was rocked by the pandemic. One of its anchor tenants, Carson’s, closed in 2018. RoomPlace took over the 84,000 square-foot space in 2019, but has been unable to match the income of its predecessor.Its other anchor tenant is Kohl’s, which occupies 102,000 square feet.The mall’s previous owners, Washington Prime Group, stopped making payments on the property’s loan in early 2021 and filed for bankruptcy months later.The mall is 81 percent occupied and JLL is marketing it as a redevelopment opportunity. It sits on 31 acres and could be transformed into a 2 million-square-foot mixed-use development.Shopping centers continue to struggle and regain their footing in the Chicago metro.

The deal is a sale-leaseback, meaning the property is sold then immediately leased back to the building’s sole tenant, Chicago marketing firm AgencyEA.The property last sold for $4.6 million in 2014, Cook County public records show. The buyer is “a private ultra-high net worth investor from Spain,” said Azora Exan’s Thania Potosome, declining to provide the buyer’s name.At its sale price, just under the $15 million asking price, it offers the new owner a 6.2 percent cap rate, a measure of rental income after expenses divided by a property’s purchase price, said James Mead of SVN’s Chicago office, who represented the seller, SALF 920 LLC. The seller put less than $5 million into the property since buying it eight years ago, adding features such as a rooftop deck.“Despite all the negative publicity Chicago is getting, there is still appetite from foreign investors for these types of deals,” Mead said.The sale demonstrates the value of Class B buildings off the beaten path — the building is outside Chicago’s main business district, the Loop — especially when leased to a single tenant. The sale-leaseback setup is a factor in adding value to such properties, Mead said.“A lot of buildings in that market are multi-tenant and it’s not as attractive to some investors,” Mead said.Demand for sale-leasebacks has strengthened during the pandemic because they allow owners to free up cash, although they were trending upward before 2020.Earlier this month, CME sold a 300,000-square-foot building at 333 South LaSalle Street for $39.5 million in a sale-leaseback transaction with electric utility ComEd.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",311 W Walton Street

The 6.2-acre development site, at the intersection of Touhy and Linder avenues, would also include a cannabis dispensary and other retail.The development will include two seven-story apartment buildings that will be built in two phases — one with 251 units and another with 243.This is a rare real estate venture for the family, which built its wealth through the ownership and sale of Helene Curtis Industries. Its brands included Suave shampoo and Degree antiperspirant. The family sold the company to Unilever in 1996 for $770 million.Ron Gidwitz was president and CEO of Helene Curtis, a company co-founded by his father Gerald in 1927. After the company’s sale, Ron became a Republican Party fundraiser and political appointee. He served as Donald Trump’s Illinois finance chairman in his 2016 presidential campaign. As President, Trump appointed him as the ambassador to Belgium and acting U.S. envoy to the European Union.His son, Scott Gidwitz, is overseeing the apartment project. During Monday’s meeting he told the village that for the past three years he had been pursuing various development options for the three single-story buildings currently on the property.Approval was unanimous by the board, but some members of the public expressed concerns about the lack of affordable housing it will bring. Unlike other Chicago suburbs, Skokie doesn’t have an affordable housing requirement ordinance.The family has owned apartments before, but with some controversy. Ron Gidwitz owned Evergreen Terrace in Joliet, a 356-unit low-income housing complex. It was blighted and known for crime, and the city seized the property in 2014.[Crain’s] — Miranda DavisAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Sangamon Street (LinkedIn, Google Maps)Joy Jordan wants to develop Chicago offices after nearly a decade selling them as a broker representing some of the city’s highest-profile landlords.The 34-year-old former Telos Group and Sterling Bay leasing agent is under contract to buy Fulton Market property with plans to develop an office building up to 200,000 square feet, she told Crain’s. Jordan parted with Sterling Bay last year after helping lease its Lincoln Yards project, and previously oversaw leasing at Willis Tower and other downtown buildings for Telos.She didn’t specify which property she’s buying, but the outlet reported she is targeting a half-acre site at 415-417 North Sangamon Street for redevelopment, citing people familiar with her plans.Her project, should it receive City Council approval for a needed zoning change, would be the latest office project to rise in Fulton Market, the lone Chicago commercial real estate market to gain tenants during the pandemic. The district has posed a challenge for older properties in the Loop amid the slow return to office as it has landed top-tier tenants seeking new development and amenities.“Fulton Market has just been on fire, and there’s not enough supply to meet the demand on the office side,” Jordan told Crain’s.Fulton Market will also present Jordan with plenty of competition from her neighbors, with established developers like her former employer Sterling Bay and Trammell Crow planning new office buildings in the neighborhood. Another 150,000-square-foot office building at 1045 West Fulton Street was recently completed without signing any tenants. Although its developer Fulton Street Cos. is closing in on a lease with law firm Norton Rose Fulbright in what could be a game-changer for the district by landing its first big law firm, a departure from the Loop’s hold on traditional non-tech tenants.Jordan named her development venture Fortem Voluntas, a Latin phrase meaning “strong will,” in part because she stands out among Chicago’s mostly male major office developers.“A lot of women are just too scared and don’t feel like they have the support from capital (investors),” Jordan told Crain’s. “It’s a very male, buddy-buddy business (where) the capital knows the capital and women are just not part of that community.”Her investors include high-net worth real estate investors and she plans to develop the building on speculation, with no tenants signed in advance of construction, betting Fulton Market’s allure keeps growing. Another former Sterling Bay employee, Howard Blair, is also an investor, and is consulting for Jordan to oversee construction details of the project. It will likely cost $100 million total, including the land acquisition, she told Crain’s.The property at the northeast corner of Sangamon and Kinzie streets holds a 43,738-square-foot building and a vacant lot next door, both owned by an entity tied to investor Grey Bemis-Kelley, Crain’s reported, citing public records. The property owner hired Cushman & Wakefield last year to market the property, and people familiar with Fulton Market pricing told Crain’s they expect it to sell for more than $11 million, or $500 per square foot.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",417 N.

The seller was Georgia-based Piedmont Office Realty Trust. It’s still the biggest office deal Chicago has seen since February 2018, according to Crain’s, as commercial investment sales have continued to drop.JLL reported that sales of office, apartment, hotel and industrial buildings totaled $8.1 billion in 2019, compared to the post-recession peak of $16 billion in 2018. Office trades had the sharpest falloff, totaling $1.2 billion in transactions last year compared to $4.7 billion in 2018.For Spear Street’s latest deal, the seller, Mirae Asset Global Investments, hoped to get $245 million when it put the 651,000-square-foot building up for sale last fall. The South Korean real estate firm paid $218 million for it in 2013.The building is 96 percent leased, with 27 tenants, including Cushman & Wakefield. But occupancy is expected to fall to 70 percent as some tenants’ leases expire over the next 18 months, according to Real Estate Alert, which first reported the sale.Those upcoming vacancies could have led to a price chop from the listed amount, Crain’s said. The building is located in an area along the Chicago River, where office tenants pay 17 percent more than the average rent for top-tier buildings elsewhere downtown, according to Cushman & Wakefield.

Earlier this year, California hotel investor Sunstone called Chicago’s hotel market oversupplied as it sold two assets at losses from their purchase prices.Yet Fulton Market’s hotels such as the Hoxton and SoHo House and their retail offerings have contributed to the work-play-live scene that’s made the Chicago neighborhood among the hottest of late.The development team consists of Joseph A. McMillan, CEO and chairman of Azur, and Golub & Company. McMillan also leads luxury developer DDG, which was the firm working with Chicago’s Marc Realty to bring a 13-story, 250-room hotel branded by Standard to the Randolph Street site, according to previously published reports.Marc Realty is no longer involved in the project, a spokesperson for the developers said.The redirection toward residential adds the project to the ongoing apartment development boom in the West Loop and especially in Fulton Market, where both housing and offices are in demand. The West Loop had more than 9,000 units planned or under construction — more than the rest of downtown Chicago neighborhoods combined – as of March. Much of that development has come after the City Council did away with a ban on residential zoning in that area in April 2021.The tower is planned for the western portion of the site at the corner of West Randolph Street and North Racine Avenue, overlooking the intersection of North Willard Court and West Randolph. It’s set to include 400 rental units, 80 of which will be marketed as affordable housing to meet the city’s 20 percent Affordable Requirements Ordinance.The project has to go before the city’s Zoning Committee and Plan Commission, as well as the City Council, for approval. There’s not yet a public timeline for its completion.Other glass high-rises recently proposed for Fulton Market include Chicago developer Fred Latsko’s plans for nearly 40 stories at 375 North Morgan Street on the site of the Guinness brewery and taproom under construction. Emerging developer Joy Jordan is also moving forward with a 17-story mixed-use tower on Sangamon Street, which will include office and retail space. Construction on Sterling Bay’s first multifamily project in Fulton Market is also underway at 160 North Morgan Street.Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified Mill Hill Capital as a member of the development team.

A groundbreaking could happen in August, and initial work could start as early as April, according to the report.Former President Barack Obama announced the news in a video posted to his Twitter account Wednesday, saying “the center will create jobs and economic opportunity, especially for South Side residents.”“We know that by working together, we can unlock the South Side’s fullest potential,” he added.I’m proud to announce that the Obama Presidential Center will officially break ground in 2021. Our hope is that the center will breathe new life into historic Jackson Park while delivering jobs, growth, and much more to the South Side.Let’s get to work. pic.twitter.com/cOqoPmaLkf— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) February 3, 2021The project has served as a source of pride for Chicago with the promise of drawing thousands of visitors each year. It could also open up opportunities for multifamily investors and developers to build in the area.But it has also received pushback from residents in surrounding Woodlawn, who fear it will contribute to gentrification, with rising home prices making the neighborhood increasingly unaffordable. In July, city officials negotiated a deal that will require developers to include affordable housing for projects on city-owned property in Woodlawn. The agreement, worked out with residents and the local alderman, will also provide up to $20,000 in funding for home improvement work to some homeowners.The city hailed Wednesday’s announcement as a “major milestone,” according to the report, and touted the investments that would follow, leading to more jobs and improved infrastructure. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the center will “distinguish our city’s historic South Side as a world-class economic and cultural hub.”The federal reviews were conducted through the National Environmental Policy Act and are related to a process to measure the center’s effect on protected parkland. Jackson Park is on the National Register of Historic Places.In an interview with Crain’s, Obama Foundation chief engagement officer Michael Strautmanis responded to the timing of the review’s completion, coming two weeks after former President Donald Trump left office and President Joe Biden was sworn in.“I am not going to look to see why we got this now, at this point,” he told the publication. “I just know that we’re here, and it’s been a long road to get here, and I’m ready to get started.” [Tribune, Crain’s] — Alexi FriedmanAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

It marks the first time apartments will be developed in Oak Brook, and it’s the first multi-tenant office project since Hines built office space in the suburb in 2000, according to The Doings.The apartment portion of the project proved controversial, with opponents worried the units could sit vacant or be turned into Section 8 housing. After unveiling its plans for the site in January, Hines addressed neighbors’ concerns by paring down its rental units from the originally proposed 500 to the approved number of 250.McDonald’s completed its move from Oak Brook to Fulton Market in summer 2018. Weeks later, Hines had a deal to acquire a 328,000-square-foot office building at the former campus, and announced plans for a new mixed-use “village center” on the site.The Hines site represents just a small part of the former McDonald’s headquarters.

The property traded hands in 2016 for $105 million, according to previous reporting in The Real Deal. The owner is Ohio’s Connor Group.This year has seen a surge in large suburban complexes like Stonebridge trading hands at high prices. Pennsylvania’s Morgan Properties recently paid about $181 million for more than 1,000 apartments across multiple properties in the suburbs. That deal surpassed a previous record price set by Oak Brook-based Albion Residential’s purchase of a 612-unit multifamily asset in Palatine for $140 million. Now, a slowdown in multifamily development caused by rising interest rates could be working in favor of sellers, even as it makes debt more expensive for buyers.With supply shortened by a lack of development due to surging costs of both interest and construction, rents have risen in the Chicago area this year by more than 9 percent, and landlords are cashing in.CBRE’s listing for the Stonebridge apartment complex pitches it as a “full package stable workforce housing asset.” CBRE executive vice president Steve LaMotte, who is handling the listing, didn’t return a request for comment from The Real Deal.The debt-free property’s occupancy is consistently high, according to the listing, and is currently at more than 95 percent. The units average 1,075 square feet, with the rents starting at $1,399 for a one-bedroom apartment and going up to $2,599 for a two-bedroom, according to Connor Group’s website.Built in the 1970s, the complex has seen varying levels of renovation over the last few years, which the CBRE listing touts as an opportunity to add value.“The possibilities are virtually limitless in this rare large asset acquisition in Arlington Heights, a highly-desirable suburb of Chicago,” the listing reads.The listing also notes Arlington Heights’ proximity to 40 million square feet of office space in the northwest Cook County and O’Hare office markets.Affluent Arlington Heights-Palatine was one of Chicago’s best-performing suburbs in terms of drops in vacancy rates and rises in rent in 2021, according to Marcus & Millichap’s latest Chicago Multifamily Market Report. Some brokers said the pandemic has made the suburbs more attractive places to live as remote work models crimp the need for downtown offices and workers seek more room in suburban settings.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The move will bring about 120 jobs downtown.Despite McDonald’s planting its roots deeper in Chicago’s West Loop, Kempczinski said that the city’s crime rate has forced big companies such as Caterpillar, Boeing and Citadel to relocate.Boeing was the first to announce it will depart its headquarters of more than 20 years and will relocate to Arlington, Virginia. Then, in June, Ken Griffin announced plans to move his family and hedge fund Citadel to Miami. Finally, last month, Caterpillar listed its Deerfield office for sublease ahead of its move to Texas.Kempczinski said multiple governors and mayors tried to court McDonald’s officials to attract the company to their cities and that it was a challenge convincing executives to stay put.Over the past two years there have been multiple shooting victims around Chicago-area McDonald’s. Nine people were shot and two were killed in a single incident near a Near North Side McDonald’s at Chicago Avenue and State Street.Last year, 7-year-old Jaslyn Adams was shot while in the drive-thru lane at one of the restaurant’s locations in Homan Square. Kempczinski faced calls to resign after texts between him and Mayor Lori Lightfoot were released that showed him implying that the seven year old’s parents were ultimately responsible for what happened. He later apologized.Despite the incidents, Kempczinski said McDonald’s decided it wouldn’t be right to leave the area as soon as things got bad.“The worst thing to have happen would be for McDonald’s — when the trouble starts happening in a neighborhood — for us to start backing out.”— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Craig and Alexis Eyler say the Darvish’s Evanston home blocks the Eylers’ view of Lake Michigan, according to the report.The Darvishes paid $4.6 million in May for the six-bedroom lakefront home at 90 Kedzie Street, the second-most expensive home sale ever recorded in Evanston. When they sought to build a fence around their yard, the Eylers agreed not to object, as long as the fence was made of wrought iron, according to the suit.Instead, the Darvishes built a solid, 6-foot-tall cedar fence that violates an easement from the 1940s guaranteeing the Eylers unobstructed views of the lake, according to the suit.The suit seeks unspecified damages from the pitcher and his wife.His 5,400-square-foot home, on a third of an acre, went on the market last October 2017 for $4.2 million, but Darvish added an adjoining lot.

The order clears the way for the 1,635-room property, the city’s second largest after the Hyatt Regency, to be sold for a fraction of its value before the pandemic crushed the hospitality industry.The ruling came less than a week after Wells Fargo took control of the 610-room JW Marriott Chicago in the Loop after the owner, a venture of Orlando-based Estein USA, defaulted on a $203.5 million loan. Wells Fargo won control with the sole $251 million bid.Palmer House, among the first to suffer as Covid erupted, was valued at $328 million in March, compared with its $560 million appraisal in 2018, when Thor took out the mortgage. Lender Wells Fargo asked the court almost two years ago to appoint a receiver for the property, at 17 East Monroe Street, in one of the largest local foreclosure lawsuits against Thor over the defaulted loan.Thor had another loan tied to the property that was sold to CMBS investors. Investors in the $94 million mezzanine loan will probably lose their stake in the property once a sheriff’s foreclosure sale is complete. Wells Fargo could buy the property and then sell it.Thor fought against the foreclosure by arguing that the pandemic made it impossible for the company to make mortgage payments.The judge determined that since there wasn’t a government order that forced the closure of the hotel, it still needed to make payments on the mortgage. Judge Edward Robles said a pandemic isn’t an “unforeseeable event” and that the company could have continued to pay the mortgage.Thor also faces another potential foreclosure lawsuit, on the retail part of the Palmer House property. A trustee representing the investors of a $62 million CMBS loan on the retail space filed a foreclosure complaint in December 2020.[CCB] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",17 East Monroe Street

LaSalle Street and 320 S. Canal Street (Google Maps)Debt tied to office buildings in Chicago’s Loop is set to be sold for a loss as major tenants BMO Harris Bank and law firm Chapman & Cutler relocate within the city, adding to downtown commercial real estate distress.New York-based Union Bank has hired brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle to sell a loan of almost $191 million on the buildings at 115 South LaSalle Street and 111 West Monroe Street, Crain’s reported, citing sources familiar with the offering.About 900,000 square feet of the two structures, which are 27 and 23 stories, have been home to BMO and the law firm, but both those tenants are relocating to the bank’s namesake property completed last year, BMO Tower, next to Union Station, Crain’s reported.With record-high downtown office vacancies amid the pandemic and the moves pending, the buildings’ owner, South Korea-based Samsung Life Insurance, probably would have struggled to refinance its mortgage.If a loan sale closes, it would worsen the pain in the Loop’s office market, which has been hit with a series of missed mortgage payments by building owners totaling around $600 million, The Real Deal reported last week.AMTrust Realty and Brookfield Properties, which own buildings where loan payments have been missed at 135 South LaSalle Street immediately south of the Samsung-owned BMO office and on 175 Jackson Boulevard, recently said they will start negotiations about restructuring their loans.That means there is competition with other distressed properties for Union Bank as it looks to unload the soon-to-be-former BMO office.AmTrust’s 1.3 million-square-foot building on LaSalle, which is 87 years old, is already mostly vacant after Bank of America left for its own namesake tower on Wacker Drive.Landlords of older buildings in particular are feeling the pain as companies are signing leases for Class A buildings in Fulton Market, TRD has reported.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",115 S.

The brand decided not to renew a lease that expires at the end of the year.Old Navy has occupied the space at 150 North State Street for the past 10 years. Before it took over from Borders, Old Navy had a store about a block south that’s now home to Primark. Old Navy has five stores in the Chicago area proper.The clothing store, owned by San Francisco-based Gap, hasn’t said if it would open a smaller store somewhere nearby or leave the neighborhood altogether. The decision to exit comes after DSW said in June that it’s leaving its store at 35 South State Street in June.Gap also closed its Chicago flagship store last year. Gap occupied a three-story, 46,000 square foot building at 555 North Michigan Ave. from 2000 until its lease expired in November 2020, and the store closed in January 2021.The soon-to-be-vacant Old Navy space has 7,300 square feet at street level and the remaining 24,700 square feet spans the second, third and lower levels. According to CBRE, which is marketing the space, a new tenant would probably pay a lower rent than Old Navy because of the Loop’s weak state. Disney, New York & Co. and Urban Outfitters closed retail outlets on State Street during the pandemic.In the Central Loop, which includes State Street, the vacancy rate fell to 23.1 percent at the end of 2021, from 26.1 percent six months earlier, brokerage Stone Real Estate found.

01:05 PM","Felicia Kelly, a restaurant owner in Chicago’s historic Bronzeville district, is sure the South Side community’s revival is here to stay after development was stalled for more than a decade by the financial crisis and rising crime.","[""(Bronzeville Lakefront, Zillow)Felicia Kelly, a restaurant owner in Chicago’s historic Bronzeville district, is sure the South Side community’s revival is here to stay after development was stalled for more than a decade by the financial crisis and rising crime.That kind of hope was once rare in a neighborhood that inspired poet Gwendolyn Brooks to write We Real Cool about the young players she saw at Bronzeville’s Golden Shovel pool hall. The poem ends: “We Sing sin. We Thin gin. We Jazz June. We Die soon.’’Bronzeville, dubbed the city’s “Black Metropolis,” is home to African-American businesses and artists, but has long been underdeveloped, with thousands of vacant lots after years of disinvestment. Now, business owners like Kelly are encouraged as the city promotes new developments in the South Side community that once was home to Brooks and musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Nat “King” Cole, Sam Cook, Dinah Washington, Quincy Jones, and Herbie Hancock.Kelly opened her Cajun seafood restaurant ‘Surf’s Up Bronzeville’ at 43rd Street and South Cottage Grove Avenue on Dec. 30, after seeing a bustling scene of new Black-owned mom-and-pop stores. Compared with Surf’s Up South Shore, the store’s first location in the city, Kelly said they have been getting a lot more customers due to foot traffic in the area.“It took a couple of years for our sister restaurant on 71st and South Shore to really pick up,” Kelly said. “They had to host a lot of events to get recognized. I can say we’ve been getting recognition pretty quickly. On Fridays and Saturdays, we see well over 100 or more people.”Multifamily Investors\nMeanwhile, adding to the revitalization, the neighborhood is drawing multifamily property investors chasing higher returns and Chicagoans in search of affordable homes at a time when soaring prices have put much of the city and suburbs out of reach for many buyers.Some 28 new construction houses or townhouses sold in Bronzeville last year, the largest number of newly-built homes sold in any Chicago neighborhood in 2021, according to Crain’s. The Humboldt Park neighborhood trailed, with sales of 25 homes, and Logan Square and Bridgeport followed with 21 each.Sandwiched between the Loop and Hyde Park on the shore of Lake Michigan, the proximity to downtown Chicago and affordability are what drove buyers to Bronzeville during the pandemic when home prices surged. The neighborhood features late 19th and early 20th century attached row houses in the Italianate, Queen Anne, Romanesque, and Classical Revival styles as well as more modern single-family homes.Those houses “were flying off the market because these were luxury homes that you would find in Lincoln Park or Logan Square for half the price in some cases,” said Sheila Dantzler, a Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty agent.Pre-pandemic, a new 3,000-square-foot single-family home in Bronzeville would be listed anywhere between $600,000 and $700,000, according to Dantzler. “Last year, that [price] ticked up to anywhere between $700,000 and $900,000,” she said.The city’s biggest challenges as it works to spur development in Bronzeville are to bring down the crime rate and avoid pricing out long-time residents.“It’s a systemic risk” for developers looking to develop in the city, said Kier Group’s partner Aaron Sklar, who specializes in brokering multifamily properties on the city’s South and West Sides.Persistent Crime\nThe number of crime incidents including robbery, homicide, and sexual assault last year totaled 1,548 in Bronzeville, about 49 percent higher than the affluent Lincoln Park’s tally of 1,040, according to the Chicago Police Department.The median price of homes sold in Bronzeville was more than $550,000 in the first 11 months of 2021, according to the Chicago Association of Realtors. That compares with $318,000, the median price of homes sold across the city in the same period.While development on the South Side has been on a pause for the past decade, Kiser Group’s partner Noah Birk said it’s only in Bronzeville where developers, particularly from out-of-state, are coming to build small-unit multifamily properties that yield higher capitalization rates, a measure of return on assets, compared with the rest of the nation.“Landlords that we talk to every day are having zero problem putting tenants in,” said Birk. “There’s definitely people that want to be in the area, particularly in nicely rehab places.”Cap rates for multifamily properties were in the mid-8 percent range, higher than the average of 5 percent across the country last year, according to Marcus and Millichap.Money trickling into the area means more retail and large developments, such as the $3.8 billion Bronzeville Lakefront project, a 100-acre mixed-use development with apartments, townhomes, hotels, and a life science campus, planned for completion by 2041.Multibillion-dollar Project\nIt’s one of three multibillion-dollar projects approved by the Chicago City Council, with the construction of infrastructure scheduled to begin this fall on the first phase, developed by GRIT Chicago composed of Farpoint Development, Loop Capital, Draper & Kramer, Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives, McLaurin Development, and Bronzeville Community Development Partnership.Built on the former Michael Reese Hospital site, the project, built from the ground up, can create synergies between commercial, residential buildings, and landscaping – becoming the next “Fulton Market,’’ the development in the former meatpacking district that has been the bright spot downtown, said Eric Helfand, principal at Farpoint.“When we think of building large office towers in Fulton Market over a decade ago, people would’ve said, ‘What are you talking about?’,” Helfand said. “I think of it in the same construct as Bronzeville Lakefront. You have to be a little bit of a visionary to understand what the opportunities are.”From planning how to build road grids that are efficient for cars and pedestrians to developing district-wide infrastructure, the Bronzeville projects are significantly different from building at Fulton Market, a densely populated area in the city filled with bars, restaurants, tech and life science companies.The $600 million first phase, expected to be completed in 2024, will develop the site with a 40,000-square-foot community center, as a life science campus focused on health and biomedical technology, and an innovation center of more than 500,000 square feet of office and lab space.The project’s $3 billion second phase, encompassing 6.8 million square feet, is expected to include more medical research facilities, offices, retail, and residential units.Other major developments in Bronzeville include 43 Green, a $100 million project with 99 residential units and more than 5,000 square feet of retail space, which broke ground last month.Further south at 11444 South Halsted Street, a long-vacant former strip mall is being transformed into a mixed-use complex. Dubbed The Morgan Park Commons, the development will include 250 rental units, 140 single-family homes, and up to 20,000 square feet of retail space.“Bronzeville is an up-and-coming neighborhood, but it’s dead at night when businesses close,” said Kelly, adding residential developments, mom-and-pop stores, and big-box stores are sure to transform the area.“There’s so many new things coming up. It’s going to be a completely different look by this time next year.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",11444 South Halsted Street

Once the deal is finalized, Snap will move from its leased space at 648 N Clark Street in River North, Crain’s Chicago Business reported.In addition to Snap, Chicago-based transportation logistics provider MoLo Solutions is looking to almost triple its office space with a new lease at 167 N Green. The company, which currently leases 33,000 square feet at 120 N Racine Avenue, is nearing a lease of 93,000 square feet in the new Fulton Market district building.Even before Snap and MoLo finalize their leases, the building at 167 N Green is close to being 70 percent leased. It includes such tenants as CCC Information Services, Kroll, Foxtrot Market, Jet Support Services and WeWork.Many companies have been migrating to Fulton Market, including Kimberly-Clark, TikTok, Hazel Technologies and Calamos Investments. They have followed the lead of other larger corporations like Google, McDonald’s and Glassdoor.The space Snap is looking to lease is on the 16th and 17th floors of 127 N Green and includes a 2,000-square-foot outdoor deck. MoLo is also looking to lease space that would span two floors in the building. The top floor of the building is also equipped with a full-sized basketball court that can be converted into a meeting space.Fulton Market has been experiencing such a boom in commercial and residential development that city officials are considering building a new Metra station there to accommodate the increased amount of commuter traffic.[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",167 N Green Street

The seller was Broadshore Capital Partners of Los Angeles.Albion paid the equivalent of $228,000 per unit, Albion President Jason Koehn said. The sale netted a solid return for Broadshore, which acquired the property through a predecessor company that spent $97 million for it in 2014. The property was valued at $115.8 million in October 2019 and Albion plans to spend about $30 million to renovate the complex with new kitchens, bathrooms, flooring and amenities.Albion financed the purchase with a senior loan from Wells Fargo and mezzanine financing from Walton Street Capital. Koehn wouldn’t say how much Albion borrowed, saying only that it covers about 65 percent of the acquisition and renovation costs.The sale topped the $137 million that a fund managed by Turner Impact Capital paid in January for the 1,155-unit Ellyn Crossing complex in Glendale Heights.“If I could have owned 10 Bourbon Squares I would have done so,” Broadshore CEO Brad Howe told The Real Deal. “It’s a really unique asset and an established, workforce-oriented property.”Howe said the unit’s sizes, more than 1,000 square feet, are up to a quarter larger than many of the new apartment units under development in the area. A “significant renovation” of the property’s common areas and units over the eight years of Broadshore’s ownership helped enhance its cash flow, he said, declining to reveal how much was spent on the upgrades.“We accomplished our business plan,” Howe said. “We generated a significant growth in the property’s income and accomplished the goal of our client,” an investor whom he declined to identify.\nThe property is about four miles northeast of another one that the company owns in Palatine, Albion on Northwest, formerly known as Birchwood on Sterling. Albion paid more than $100 million for that complex last September.[CCB] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",500 E Constitution Drive

She added that buildings would “average” around 300 feet tall but certain “icon” buildings could reach as high as 800 feet, a number that sent grumbles echoing through the audience.After the meeting, Hopkins signaled that Sterling Bay would likely have to pull back its height ambitions if it wants to appease influential neighborhood groups.“In any review process, you never see the community ask for more density,” said Hopkins, whose ward covers most of the site. “This is like any negotiation — the two sides begin somewhat far apart, and they’ll have to find common ground.”The developer envisions 12 million square feet equally divided between residential and commercial spaces, including 400 to 500 hotel rooms.It would feature an “arts and entertainment” district at the south end of the site anchored by a 20,000-seat soccer stadium. The company announced a deal in May with Cubs owner Tom Ricketts to bring a United Soccer League team to the venue.Cabonargi also described an overhaul of the roadways that criss-cross the site. The plan would extend Dominick and Kingsbury avenues so they run continuously from Webster Avenue to North Avenue, and it would vacate some smaller streets, like Dickens and Southport avenues.New traffic bridges would extend Dominick and Concord Place over the river, and a planned 1,300-foot extension of The 606 trail would carry cyclists and pedestrians over the waterway. About a quarter of the 53-acre property would be dedicated to open recreational space, including a mile of riverwalk promenades.The company has not shared how it would fund the neighborhood-sized development, which it said could accommodate 23,000 on-site jobs. The site is among those the city has proposed as a potential home to Amazon’s coveted second North American headquarters.Sterling Bay bought the 22-acre site of A. Finkl Steel & Sons on the east bank of the river in late 2016, and months later paid the city $105 million for the 13-acre former home of its fleet and facilities management department on the west bank. Earlier this week General Iron Industries announced it would sell its 21.5-acre property, which sits immediately south and east of Sterling Bay’s holdings.The developer has been accelerating its activity Downtown and in the West Loop so far this year, most recently by buying up about 900,000 square feet of office space in the former John Hancock Center in a more than $300 million deal.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

It could also fetch the highest total price for a Downtown office building in more than two years, according to the report.McDonald’s moved its headquarters from Oak Brook to the nine-story building in June 2018. Its long-term lease of 85 percent of the building runs through July 2033.Though investment sales have lagged in most other parts of the city, interest in Fulton Market has remained high, allowing the developers that helped transform the former meatpacking district.Sterling Bay sold its own headquarters on the western edge of Fulton Market at 1330 West Fulton Street $168 million in August amid plans to relocate to the new building it was constructing at 333 North Green Street.Sterling Bay also lured Google to Fulton Market with the development of its Midwest headquarters at 1330 West Fulton Market. The developer sold that building, known as 1KFulton, in 2016 for $257 million, making it the highest-priced building sale completed in the neighborhood west of the Kennedy Expressway, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Hendrickson with the North Riverside Plaza in Riverside and Elmhurst Crossing in Elmhurst (Brixmor, LinkedIn)New York investment firm Brixmor Property Group raised its bet on Chicago-area shopping centers, picking one up for $75 million and another right next to a mall that faced foreclosure last year.Brixmor bought the Elmhurst Crossing and North Riverside Plaza shopping centers from Montreal-based Federal Construction, the longtime owner of both properties.Brixmor spent $75.1 million on Elmhurst Crossing, or about $216 per square foot for the Whole Foods-anchored property at the northwest corner of Route 83 and St. Charles Road, DuPage County records show.The North Riverside property’s sale price hasn’t been posted in public records yet. Assuming the REIT paid an identical price per square foot as it did on Elmhurst, the North Riverside property would have cost $83 million, though it had more vacant space than the Elmhurst property at the time of the sale. Also potentially depressing the value is the property’s neighbor, the North Riverside Park Mall, which has been on the verge of foreclosure since last year. Brixmor’s recently purchased North Riverside property was mortgaged for $52 million in 2014, public records show.The deals represent a move deeper into the Chicago market for Brixmor, which just purchased another Whole Foods-anchored retail strip called Ravinia Plaza in Orland Park, paying $26 million at $257 per square foot in February. It also is in the midst of a $21 million overhaul of Tinley Park Plaza in the southern suburb of Tinley Park that includes demolition of 87,000 square feet and building 66,000 square feet of new space.The firm is leaning further into the market while grocery-anchored retail across the country is performing well. The asset class has been given a boost despite e-commerce making inroads during the pandemic.In Chicago’s North Mayfair neighborhood, the Sterling Organization paid $18.2 million, or $208 per square feet in March to buy the Jewel Osco-anchored North Mayfair Commons from Canada’s Sun Life Assurance. Prices have moved up since December, when North American Real Estate paid $30 million, or $180 per square foot, for a suburban strip mall anchored by Jewel in suburban Glen Ellyn.In addition to Whole Foods, Elmhurst Crossing is anchored by Kohl’s, At Home and Petco, with leases to restaurants Portillo’s and Chick-Fil-A as well as Bath & Body Works, Wells Fargo and Pure Hockey. It is fully leased except for a single vacant 2,400-square-foot unit, Brixmor said.The North Riverside property is anchored by Kohl’s, Burlington, Best Buy, Petco, Michael’s and a new grocery under construction, with retail and dining leases to Chick-Fil-A, Chili’s and T-Mobile, as well. It has three vacant spaces totaling 25,000 square feet, Brixmor said.Mid-America Real Estate brokers Ben Wineman and Kathryn Sugrue represented the seller.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",83 and St. Charles Road

The property in question is owned by billionaire Justin Ishbia, the head of Chicago-based private-equity firm Shore Capital Partners.The proposal came after Ishbia proposed a land swap deal with Winnetka Park District that combined two Winnetka parks that were separated by an individual residential lot. The land swap would allow the park district to combine its Elder Lane and Centennial parks — giving the combined beaches a full 1,000 feet of shoreline.An entity named Orchard 2020 paid a combined $23.9 million for three lakefront estates in Winnetka, according to Crain’s. The Chicago Tribune later identified Ishbia as the person behind the LLC.The agenda for the park board meeting Thursday said the body will hold a closed session with the property owner’s representatives about the project. Park district officials didn’t respond to requests for comment from Crain’s.Opponents say the plan would inspire other wealthy shoreline homeowners to build these types of seawalls, effectively closing off public views of the shoreline, “a treasure of going to the beach in Winnetka, or almost anywhere on the North Shore,” Winnetka homeowner Laurie Petersen told Crain’s.Beyond those who spoke during public meetings on the proposal, 1,400 people have signed a petition opposing the wall.It’s unclear whether the park district and Ishbia will pursue the wall again or if the project is not moving forward.[Crain’s] — Miranda DavisAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

An asking price was not included.If a buyer pursues a zoning change, the parcels could eventually accommodate more than 5.3 million square feet of built space, according to the brochure. The institute would hang onto its core campus between Chestnut Street and Chicago Avenue, but it could hand over some of its unused density to give an adjacent development more room to grow, according to HFF brokers.Moody Bible Institute president Mark Jobe announced earlier this month that the school would sell off its outer-lying properties, a mix of low-lying and vacant buildings, in order to fund infrastructure and technology upgrades for its campus.Brokers pitched the less developed western portion of River North as an area ripe for retail, apartment, office or hotel development. They point to “pent-up demand” for office and living space from the neighborhood’s roughly 18 percent population growth since 2000.River North commands some of the city’s highest office rents and lowest commercial vacancy, due in part to its reputation as a hub for tech startups.The listing marks one of HFF’s biggest sales efforts since the company was acquired by JLL on July 1.A representative of JLL declined to comment on the listing on Tuesday.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

If she follows up, it could almost quadruple taxes to $85.5 million next year.Reilly, who represents the Loop, the Magnificent Mile and River North, was among 21 aldermen who voted against the policy in 2021, partly reflecting his district’s big commercial properties and high-priced homes.“As opponents like me pointed out when this was debated, even the Mayor’s five percent cap ‘guardrail’ would still result in a massive property tax increase at a time residents and small businesses are struggling to pay their bills,” Reilly said in a statement. “Contrary to the Administration’s earlier assertions, it turns out CPI is, in fact, anything but predictable these days.”The new ordinance calls for Lightfoot’s policy, which automatically raises the city’s tax levy by the rate of inflation, with a 5 percent maximum cap, to be “repealed in its entirety.”Reilly’s ordinance doesn’t have much support, however, as only nine other aldermen sponsored it. It still must go before the council’s Finance Committee and will need a majority of the 34-person committee or the 50-person council’s approval to move forward.Two years ago, when Lightfoot first introduced the policy, it was presented as a way to keep property taxes more stable, since the rate of inflation had hovered around 3 percent for most of the past 20 years. The 2022 property tax increased by $22.9 million after the inflation rate rose to 1.4 percent between December 2019 and December 2020.This year, the rate hit 7 percent.

City taxes collected from affected businesses plummeted, including in the retail, hotel and restaurant industries, according to the report.The city reopened retail shops and restaurants last week, despite damage to numerous small businesses from looting and vandalism that broke out during the recent protests against police brutality and racial injustice.Lightfoot brought up the potential for the property tax hikes — along with layoffs to city employees — to help make up for the expected lost revenue to the city’s $11.6 billion overall budget, according to the report. But she added the moves would be a last resort.“Our businesses have been suffering and many of our small businesses, unfortunately, have been forced to close,” she said, according to the Tribune. The 2021 budget shortfall could end up exceeding $1 billion, city officials said.For the 2020 budget, the mayor plugged a $838 million budget deficit she inherited in part with a $65 million property tax increase. That included a tax of $15 million for new construction projects. Lightfoot’s original plan for a real estate transfer tax was scuttled.

District officials removed him from his post while keeping him on the CPS payroll, citing the inspector’s report in its decision.Beyer denied Schuler’s accusations and sued the Chicago Board of Education in an attempt to get his job back, calling the report’s findings “extremely inaccurate.” The lawsuit is ongoing.But earlier this month, Chicago Public Schools suspended his salary, Beyer said. That’s when he began working for Giglio-Vakos, one of four neighbors on his West Town block who also happen to be high-producing real estate brokers.“I have to earn money for my family, and given the timeframe of the lawsuit, I’m not going to hold my breath,” Beyer said. “And quite frankly I’ve been considering a new career because I’ve gotten a bit tired of education, especially considering my experience.”Beyer was impressed by the “aggressive” work of Giglio-Vakos’ team, and by Compass’ embrace of new broker technology, he said. He enrolled in a 90-hour class with the Chicago Association of Realtors to get his license and attended a Compass orientation Monday.Giglio-Vakos said she welcomed Beyer’s experience in education.“Schools are a big part of many people’s decisions in looking to buy or sell,” Giglio-Vakos said. “He saw from the very beginning that he could bring that aspect to the table … it’s hugely valuable.”Giglio-Vakos launched Team MVP in 2013. The group worked under the Jameson Sotheby brand until Compass came to Chicago in late 2017, and Giglio-Vakos was one of the first local brokers to jump to the new firm.Her team now lists condos, townhomes and houses ranging from $125,000 to $2 million, mostly focusing on newly-built homes. Last year, Team MVP racked up about $102 million in sales volume.Beyer joined this month, but he began considering the career switch shortly after his dismissal last year, he said.“Frankly, the idea of going to another school after my experience working at CPS does not really appeal to me,” Beyer said, adding that he was looking for “some flexibility” after a career of 12-hour days and working on weekends.Earlier this year, the educator began reaching out to some of his other neighbors in the 1800 block of West Erie Street, including Gary Lucido of Lucid Realty and Ivona Kutermankiewicz of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices KoenigRubloff. He cited a side-interest in architecture as part of the reason he drifted into the industry, adding he earned a master’s degree in art history from the University of Illinois at Chicago.Beyer also launched a venture called “Live & Learn: Home & School Specialists,” a consulting firm to help parents search for homes “in tandem” with scouting out schools, he said.“I’m a hard worker and I know a lot of people, so why not?” Beyer said. “I’ve always been one of those geeks who goes on Zillow and looks around at stuff for fun, so it wasn’t alien to me at all.”If Beyer wins his lawsuit and the school district reverses its decision, he would return to his position as principal at Ogden but would continue his real estate practice “on the side,” he said.Representatives of Chicago Public Schools and the inspector general’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1800 block of West Erie Street

R. Thompson Center, Crain’s reported. He’s buying it from the state and plans to update the building’s offices and potentially even convert the upper floors into a hotel.“A lot of people have questioned whether I have a screw loose or something,” Reschke told Crain’s. Despite record vacancy rates, however, “it’s a very rational — I think — well thought-out project if you just study the project and what you’re working with.”Reschke began making a name for himself in the 1980s by building multi-billion dollar buildings. Reschke’s Prime Group developed a 51-story tower at 77 West Wacker Drive that served as the corporate headquarters for R.R. Donnelley and United Airlines.Reschke also transformed parts of LaSalle Street with the purchase of an outdated office building at 11 South LaSalle, which he turned into the Residence Inn Chicago Downtown. He also spent almost $400 million renovating the building, at 208 South LaSalle Street, and converted the first 12 floors into the JW Marriott Chicago. He was also hired to develop an almost $200 million 388-room hotel at 150 East Ontario Street in Streeterville.Reschke is also known for his ability to avoid loan trouble by refinancing properties through public securities markets and negotiations with lenders.“The people that are having problems today are maybe the hotels that are average performers or even weak performers,” Reschke told Crain’s in February. “Assets that really were stellar pre-COVID are still desirable investment vehicles for institutions.”[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",77 West Wacker Drive

The listing price is a record for Lake Geneva, Wisconsin and is one of the highest asking prices for a home in Midwestern history.The buyer of the 14,145-square-foot mansion, which was designed by the Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge firm, has yet to be identified and the final sales price of the home is unknown.Glanworth Gardens (Geneva Lakefront Realty)The property, which is known as Glanworth Gardens today, was originally called Wadsworth Hall when it was built in 1906. The home was built for noted banker Norman Wait Harris and named for his mother’s family. The estate features an original landscape plan from Frederick Law Olmsted and includes 621 feet of lake frontage.After Harris died in 1916, the estate was sold to Yellow Taxi Cab Company founder Walden W. Shaw. The mansion was passed down to his son-in-law Daniel F. Peterkin, who was the president of Morton Salt.Driehaus bought the property from the Peterkin family for $4.83 million in 1998. He threw large annual theme parties with celebrities like Jay Leno and the Beach Boys in attendance.If the 40-acre estate sells for anything close to the asking price, it will be a Lake Geneva record. The current record for priciest home sale in the city was set in April when Thomas Tisbo spent $12.75 million on a 12-year-old, 13,000-square-foot, 10-bedroom lakefront mansion.The home next door to Glanworth Gardens is currently for sale with the area’s second-highest list price. The 12,396-square-foot, six-bedroom Villa Hortensia that sits on 20.5 acres was listed for $20.75 million in February.[Chicago Tribune] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

02:00 PM","The Chicago-area retail vacancy rate has fallen for the second consecutive year, driven by growing leasing activity in the suburbs and in the city’s West Loop and River West neighborhoods.","[""Shoppers on the Magnificent MileThe Chicago-area retail vacancy rate has fallen for the second consecutive year, driven by growing leasing activity in the suburbs and in the city’s West Loop and River West neighborhoods.The region’s vacancy rate is on pace to fall from 6.6 percent last year to 6.2 percent for the duration of 2018, according to a report from Marcus & Millichap. The report also noted a 3.4 percent jump in the average asking rent for retail spaces across the metro area, which is poised to hit $17.60 this year.“The takeaway here is that things are looking pretty good” for Chicago-area retail, according to Sean Sharko, a Chicago-based senior vice president with Marcus & Millichap. Sharko noted the roughly 2 million square feet of new retail space expected to have come online in the area by year’s end, compared to 2.3 million in 2017.“We’re seeing new construction being held in check,” Sharko said. “That will allow for some of these new shopping centers to slowly and consistently get filled up, and move rents in the right direction.”Retail vacancies nudged up inside Chicago during the 12-month period ending on June 30, reaching 4.7 percent after 59,000 square feet of new space was absorbed into the market. Average retail rents in the city also declined by about 1 percent this year, wiping out a 1-percent increase last year and settling at $25.63 per square foot.But 3.4 million square feet of retail absorption in the suburbs pushed the suburban vacancy rate down by a half-percentage point to 6.8 percent this year, led by an especially sharp decline in Schaumburg, according to the report. Retail rents in the suburbs average $15.68 per square foot.The West Loop and River West posted the sharpest vacancy rate declines out of the 11 Chicago-area submarkets described in the report, hitting 2.8 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.Sharko said the hot retail leasing in those neighborhoods “speaks to how much effect millennials are having on the retail landscape,” noting a RentCafe report last month that listed the West Loop as one of the youngest urban neighborhoods in the country.Young adults “have more of a grab-and-go shopping strategy than baby boomers, and they tend to eat out a lot,” Sharko said. “They shop at service-oriented retailers more than baby boomers, and that goes into why you’re seeing retailers open up so much in these locations.”Meanwhile, vacancy rates ticked up in the Gold Coast and East Loop submarkets, possibly reverberating from high-profile Magnificent Mile closures like those announced by Forever 21 and Tommy Bahama last month.The Marcus & Millichap report cuts against the findings of a CBRE report published earlier this year, which showed Chicago-area retail vacancies surge to their highest point since 2010.But it aligns with findings published in July by Newmark Knight Frank, which posted the regional retail vacancy rate at 6.4 percent.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

05:09 PM","As construction crews on Monday began preliminary work on the $700 million Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park, a local advocacy group was prepping for another run at stopping it.","[""Barack Obama with a rendering of the Obama Presidential Center. (Getty, Obama)As construction crews on Monday began preliminary work on the $700 million Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park, a local advocacy group was prepping for another run at stopping it.Protect Our Parks said it would appeal a federal court judge’s decision to deny its emergency request to halt construction. The group is among several that have battled the Obama Foundation in court to move the complex two miles away to Washington Park.Protect Our Parks and other neighborhood organizations want the center built farther south because they believe it will better bolster a needier area with jobs and development, and will not impact Dusable Lake Shore Drive or eat up Lake Michigan parkland. And while the long-awaited Obama Center project has drawn the attention of developers and investors to the South Side, Jackson Park neighbors fear it will bring more gentrification and price hikes that will squeeze them out of their homes.On Aug. 6, U.S. District Judge John Blakely denied a preliminary injunction to stop the project, following oral arguments in July. He did not issue an opinion, but the ruling allowed the Obama Foundation to close on its purchase Friday of 19.5 acres in the 550-acre park. It also allowed for work to begin. On Monday, construction crews started to take apart the Jackson Park football field to make way for roadway infrastructure.Richard Epstein, the attorney representing Protect Our Parks, called the ruling “a very bad setback,” but added, “it’s not a final judgment.”Epstein said he will file an appeal and will continue to prepare arguments for a separate lawsuit claiming the Obama Foundation, which is funding much of the center, failed to do full federal reviews of other potential sites.That lawsuit would challenge a years-long federal review of the project because Jackson Park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The review, completed in February, noted the construction and surrounding road repairs would not have a significant impact on the area. It represented a major victory toward construction of the center.Valerie Jarrett, president of the Obama Foundation and a former senior adviser to President Obama, called Blakely’s ruling “a major victory that has been years in the making.” She added, “we are officially able to begin delivering on our commitment to Chicago’s South Side.”The Obama Center, which is not an official presidential library, will take about four years to develop its four buildings.Epstein said his next court effort will be aimed at keeping construction crews from taking down hundreds of trees in Jackson Park beginning in September. Jarrett said last month that only 350 trees would be taken down — the foundation said many were small or diseased — but Epstein thinks it’s more like 800.Epstein also believes construction will create traffic jams and rerouting headaches that will bring more opponents out. And though he concedes he’s got a tough battle ahead — typically judges don’t stop projects once they’ve been started — he said he will keep fighting.“There are so many things wrong with this park, even if we lose one battle, there are still plenty ahead,” he said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The vacancy rate for U.S. regional malls reached a record 11.4 percent in the first quarter of 2021, pushing some owners into bankruptcy.CEO and founder Mike Kohan said he wasn’t aware that the payment for Spring Hill, on Route 72 in the villages of West Dundee and Carpentersville, was past due. “We’ll look into it,” Kohan said.West Village President Chris Nelson said he’s aware of the Kohan group’s history, according to the Courier-News.“They are a professional organization and should be prepared to pay their taxes on time,” Nelson said. “This also seems to be a pattern with them and, given their track record, I am concerned about them paying future bills.”Another Kohan-owned property, the Lincoln Mall shopping center in south suburban Matteson, was forced to close in early 2015 after Kohan attorneys failed to provide money to enable the receiver to make adequate repairs, the Chicago Tribune reported.According to the Kane County Treasurer’s Office, other Spring Hill Mall property parcel owners are up to date on their property tax payments. Those include empty Sears and Macy’s anchor stores as well as the Kohl’s stores. The mall is about 35% occupied, with Kohl’s as the only remaining anchor tenant.The Spring Hill Mall is 42 years old.

Rod Blagojevich — now laying down his head in a federal prison every night — famously made commuted between Springfield and Chicago in order to avoid staying in the mansion, rankling some Downstaters and racking up thousands in travel expenses.And while there’s little love lost between Pritzker and outgoing Gov. Bruce Rauner, Pritzker does owe his predecessor some gratitude. Rauner and his wife, Diana — themselves not exactly hurting for real estate — oversaw a $15 million renovation of the 163-year-old mansion, reportedly personally contributing $1 million to the effort.

The buyers will use it as a private residence.“It’s very commercial now, with exit signs everywhere and electronic fobs for coming and going,” said Mary Summerville, who represented the buyers. “All that has to be changed.”The property, which Pritzker’s Tawani Enterprises bought for $2.8 million in 2012, hit the market in April 2019 with an asking price of $5.2 million.

(Credit: Google Maps)Chicago’s hotel occupancy rate now stands at 7 percent, with the city suffering the same fate — if not worse — as the hospitality industry nationwide.The week ending April 4 saw a slight uptick in the local occupancy rate, from 5.9% at the end of March, according to the latest figures from hotel research firm STR.That is likely attributed to the city’s aggressive move to buy thousands of empty hotel rooms in order to house people who have tested positive for or been exposed to the coronavirus. The move by Mayor Lori Lightfoot is expected to involve over 2,000 hotel rooms, and is meant to ease the pressure off hospitals that are dealing with the pandemic.The city will pay $175 for each room, far above the latest average daily rate, which STR said stands at $108.91. The plummeting room rates and emptying-out hotels are the byproducts of a city and state that remains under a stay-at-home order through April, with all nonessential businesses shuttered.Across the country, hotel occupancy rate sank to 21.6 percent, STR reported, a nearly 69 percent drop from the same time last year. The rate for the last week of March was at 22.6 percent.Other top 25 markets in the U.S. are similarly struggling: Occupancy fell on average to 19.4 percent, down about 75 percent from 2019.\nComparing the latest Chicago figures to the same period last month shows the swift decline. For the first week of March, the occupancy rate stood at 56.1 percent, though the virus had not yet slammed into the city.Late last month, hotel investor and developer Oxford Capital said it was designating over 1,000 hotel rooms from five of its properties for the city’s program to house Covid-19 patients.

Residents there can spin a John Coltrane album or strum a banjo while looking out over the Downtown skyline.The Cooper, 720 South Wells Street, where studio apartment rents start around $1,900 per month, is the latest in a string of new residential buildings pressured to push the envelope with their amenity packages.As the skyline fills with towers heaping hundreds of new units into the tip-top of the city’s red-hot apartment market,\xa0 it’s become a de-facto requirement for developers to equip their leasing teams with attention-getting building features designed to justify their rising rents.Like the Cooper, here are seven other fierce residential competitors in the so-called “amenity arms race” to hit the market since last year, plus an office building that’s following suit.Related Midwest | One Bennett Park | A “tween room”One Bennett Park’s “tween room”The game-filled children’s room is a bonus for parents who live in One Bennett Park, Related Midwest’s Robert A.M Stern-designed condo-and-apartment tower nearing completion 451 East Grand Avenue in Streeterville.Then there’s the “tween room,” a space aimed exclusively at the building’s 10-to-13-year-old residents. The room is “designed for gaming, lounging or socializing” with “multiple televisions, billiards and modular furniture,” according to a spokesperson.Condo owners at One Bennett Park will also have access to a “cordial room,” a bar space with oak-paneled lockers for residents to store aged spirits.One-bedroom apartments currently start at $3,705.Bond Companies | Spoke | A “performance lounge”Spoke complex’s music roomLike the Cooper at Southbank, the 363-unit Spoke complex that opened last year at 728 North Morgan Street also boasts a music room with grabbable band equipment. But Spoke’s “performance lounge” also includes a stage and a soundproof recording studio.There’s also an acre-sized amenity deck, which includes a pool, private cabanas, fire pits, a bocce ball court and a “hydrotherapy spa.”Studios start at $1,525.Baker Development Corp. | ELEVATE Lincoln Park | A “rooftop wellness area”The 24-hour gym on the roof of the Solomon Cordwell Buenz-designed ELEVATE, 930 West Altgeld Street, lets residents wheel equipment outside so they can jog or spin in full view of Downtown. The entire penthouse level, one of two amenity decks in the 191-unit building, is also wrapped in “smart windows” that automatically dim based on sunlight conditions.Studios start at $2,075.Property Markets Group | L Logan Square | A train on the roofA year after Property Markets Group opened its 120-unit apartment building at 2211 North Milwaukee Avenue, the New York-based firm spent $200,000 to buy a an “L” car from the CTA and retrofit it on its rooftop amenity deck. The firm even changed the name of the building, originally called “X Logan Square,” to highlight the new feature.“It’s the most popular amenity we have in the portfolio,” Property Markets Group principal Noah Gottlieb said of the car. “It’s designed for gathering with friends and all social occasions.”The building is completely leased, according to its website.Optima, Inc. | Optima Signature | A 40-yard dash trackOptima Signature’s basketball courtFitness centers come standard in most new residential high-rises, but few developers can lay claim to a full-size basketball court. The 57-story Optima Signature, which opened last year at 220 East Illinois Street in Streeterville, also has a children’s playground, bocce and squash courts, a “cold-plunge shower” and three saunas. More intense competitors can time themselves on a 40-yard dash track.One-bedroom apartments start at $2,950.F&F Realty and Fifield Realty Co. | 727 West Madison | The “Sky Lounge”When Fifield and F&F started leasing apartments this month for the 492-unit tower it’s finishing at 727 West Madison Street at the entrance to the West Loop, prospective tenants got a simple proposition: hang out on the top floor of the tallest building in the neighborhood.The owners haven’t announced any features or programming for its “sky lounge,” but it’s hired Studio K, the interior designer for restaurants including Girl & the Goat, to fill in the details.Studios start at $1,735.Property Markets Group | X Chicago | “Media beds”X Chicago’s “media beds”The amenity deck at X Chicago, 710 West 14th Street, invites residents to crawl into bed and stare up at a pair of ceiling-mounted TVs.

02:45 PM","A pair of Chicago development firms are teaming up on a new Opportunity Zones venture, hoping to raise $1 billion for development projects “throughout America’s Heartland.”","[""From left: Clayco CEO Bob Clark and Farpoint founding principal Scott Goodman (Credit: iStock)A pair of Chicago development firms are teaming up on a new Opportunity Zones venture, hoping to raise $1 billion for development projects “throughout America’s Heartland.”Farpoint Development and Clayco will spearhead the Decennial Group, and will seek to deploy the money over the next three years, the company announced Thursday.It will target developments including Farpoint’s own “Burnham Lakefront” megadevelopment on nearly 100 acres of city-owned land on Chicago’s South Side, along with projects in St. Louis, Birmingham, Alabama, and in Indiana.Over the next 10 years, the venture could look to fund and build up to $20 billion in new projects.Decennial Group has enlisted one of the Opportunity Zones architects, Steve Glickman, as a “senior adviser.” Glickman, a co-founder of the Economic Innovation Group collaborative that designed the Opportunity Zones program, founded the firm Develop LLC, which consults developers and investors raising funds for Opportunity Zone projects.The Decennial Group venture joins a host of investment funds already raising hundreds of millions of dollars for future Opportunity Zones projects across the country. Decennial Group principals said unlike most other Opportunity Funds that seek out third-party developers with viable proposals for Opportunity Zone projects, their venture will oversee design and construction in-house for most of its projects.Farpoint managing principal Scott Goodman and Clayco CEO Bob Clark agreed last year to deploy a “soup-to-nuts” approach to leading each project, they said during an interview Thursday. That would enable Decennial Group to ovversee the process from fundraising through ribbon-cutting, which would help them stand out from the other Opportunity Zones funds, they said.“As this law came into effect, we were getting bombarded by calls from people trying to figure out how to invest, and it became obvious that many of the people jumping into this don’t have the capability to deploy” the capital, Clark said. He added that “delivering the whole thing in an integrated way was going to be the biggest challenge.”The 8,700 designated Opportunity Zones nationwide open a suite of tax benefits to developers and investors who can substantially raise the taxable value of the land through projects. Governors were allowed to nominate census tracts with relatively high poverty and low median incomes, or tracts adjacent to them, for the program.Investors can defer payments on capital gains that they reinvest in Opportunity Zones and reduce their ultimate tax bill, depending on how long they keep their investment. Stakeholders can also forgo paying capital gains taxes on the appreciation of the asset if they hold onto it for at least 10 years.The Decennial Group said it is exploring 250 potential projects in Opportunity Zones around the country, from Indiana to rural Colorado. The group is already in advanced negotiations over developments on at least three sites.The principals are aiming away from the coasts in order to focus on the best value and return, and to maximize social impact, Goodman said. Projects will include industrial, multifamily, office and data center construction.Chicago-based Clayco has overseen design and construction for industrial, commercial and civic developments across 35 states. Shawn Clark, president of Clayco development wing CRG, is also a managing partner of the Decennial Group.Goodman co-founded development firm Sterling Bay in 1987 and oversaw its expansion in Chicago’s Fulton Market after the 2009 recession, helping plant the seeds for that neighborhood’s unprecedented development boom. He left the company in 2016 and founded Farpoint Development. Chicago city leaders later selected his new firm oversee redevelopment of the 100-acre site of the former Michael Reese Hospital.Also joining the venture is Chicago-based renewable energy contractor 11 Million Acres. The firm will oversee the inclusion of a power-generation element on each new development, a process Goodman said he expects will “become the norm” during the next decade.Not all Opportunity Zones were placed in distressed areas, spurring criticism that the program may turbocharge development in up-and-coming areas while leaving long-neglected neighborhoods behind.Some investors are also wary of putting money behind the program until lingering questions are addressed by the next round of federal regulations, which are expected in the coming weeks.But the program is already showing an effect on property values throughout the nation. Sale prices for homes inside Opportunity Zones jumped by more than 25 percent last year, according to a recent study from Zillow.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Green StreetThe Chicago office market has been hammered by the pandemic, but one local convenience store company is eyeing a bigger headquarters in Fulton Market.Foxtrot Market is nearing a deal to ink a 30,000-square-foot lease at the massive 167 N. Green Street, according to Crain’s. Shapack Partners and Focus own the 750,000-square-foot building, which opened last year and counts WeWork and CCC Information Services among its tenants.The new office space would be nearly four times the size of Foxtrot’s current HQ at 440 N. Wells Street in River North, according to the report. The company, which runs upscale shops, recently announced it had closed a $42 million Series B funding round, and would be adding stores. Foxtrot, led by CEO and co-founder Michael LaVitola, said it would double its store count to 19, adding four more locations in Chicago, along with one in Dallas and Washington, D.C., the Chicago Tribune has reported.Foxtrot’s pending deal at 167 Green Street would also include a retail location in the 17-story building, according to Crain’s. In July, CCC, which provides software to process auto insurance claims, said it would scale back its space at the complex because of Covid, from 180,000 square feet to 125,000 square feet. WeWork inked a deal for 140,000 square feet in April 2019.If the Foxtrot lease closes, it would be good news for the Chicago office market, which has been whipsawed by the virus. A recent CBRE report showed downtown office vacancy ballooned to 15.5 percent, a figure that could rise to 20 percent if under-construction projects don’t immediately sign tenants once work is completed.

Howard St. (Cordogan Clark/49th Ward Office, Getty, Housing 4 All)Rogers Park is considering a new mid-rise apartment building that will offer its residents a convenient public transportation option.Development group Housing For All is proposing the $30 million, six-story complex with 110 units and ground-floor retail, Block Club Chicago reported. The development will replace a strip of retail and a storage facility at the intersection of West Howard and North Paulina streets, across from the Red Line.Its proximity to the Howard Street Red Line stop makes it an ideal location for high density housing, and makes it an attractive location for potential tenants.The plan would help revitalize a neighborhood that has been plagued by violence and disinvestment. It calls for 16 studio apartments, 24 one-bedroom, 42 two-bedroom and 28 three-bedroom units. Of the 110 units, 88 will be reserved for households that make 60 percent or less of the area median income — about $43,800 for a single-person household — and the remaining 22 units will be reserved for households making 30 percent of the area median income or lower.The 15,000 square feet of ground-floor retail would replace a single-story retail property at 1646-1660 West Howard Street that is currently home to a currency exchange, Post Office and restaurant.The mostly vacant, historic Werner Bros. Storage building at 7613 North Paulina Street, which was built in 1921, will have to be demolished. Since the building is listed as an “orange-rated” property on the city’s historical survey, the city has to review the building and the plans before approving a demolition permit. As is, it cannot be redeveloped for residential purposes due to ceiling height requirements.The project still requires funding approval, but work could begin later next year in late 2023, and be ready for residents by 2025, according to the developer.\nRezoning will not be necessary to move the project forward, but the city will require “planned development” due to its size.\nRead more\n\n Interfaith’s West Side permit beefs up housing for homeless \n Jonathan Rose adds $63M to Chicago affordable housing play \n CTA’s $2.3B Red Line expansion could be catalyst for South Chicago development— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1660 W.

Boeing moved its international headquarters from Seattle in 2001 before buying the building in 2005, according to Cook County property records.Property manager CBRE won a TOBY International Building of the year award for the tower this year.HERE, the Netherlands-based mapping and locations services company, operates in 55 countries employs more than 9,000 people around the world.The Boeing building is across the street from 150 North Riverside Plaza, where Riverside Investment & Development completed its 54-story office tower last year.A report released by RentCafe last week identified ZIP code 60606, where the Boeing Headquarters is located, as the most expensive ZIP code in the Midwestern United States by median apartment rent.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The development would have included a new city park and three detention ponds.Residents were worried about increased traffic on a 100-foot access road that would connect the southern edge of the development to Klein Road to the east, as well as flooding and the loss of farmland. Pulte Homes made several changes to the proposal to comply with zoning and planning requirements, according to West Chicago Director of Community Development Tom Dabareiner.Nevertheless, the city’s development committee voted against the project last week.

They will be north of a Country Inn & Suites and a Hilton Garden Inn.At the village board meeting where officials approved the project, trustees also said they would support a resolution with Cook County to provide property tax breaks for the developer.The village will hold a public hearing just before the Aug. 16 Village Board meeting at which residents can discuss the village annexing property for the project. Final approval is expected at that meeting.Top Hospitality first proposed building the hotels simultaneously in 2020.

City and federal leaders said at the time that thousands of units of mixed-income housing would be built to replace the deteriorating complex.But with that promise largely unfulfilled, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the Chicago Housing Authority are now planning to lease the largest portion of the land, situated at Roosevelt Road and Ashland Avenue, to the Fire.“We have an agency… that is supposed to provide housing for the most vulnerable, and instead of building housing they want to give that land to a soccer team,” said Rod Wilson, director of the nonprofit Eugenia Burns Hope Center, an affordable housing advocacy group. “It seems that the CHA wants to get out of the business of providing quality housing for families.”The CHA told ProPublica that the lease agreement with the team would fund repairs to aging ABLA properties and provide jobs.“That property has been sitting vacant for 20 years and it’s time for us to do something productive with it,” said CHA CEO Tracey Scott, adding that the proposed practice facility is “in line with our philosophy of mixed-use, mixed-income community development.”It’s not the first time the CHA has allowed its land to be developed for non-housing purposes. It has sold or leased property for a nonprofit tennis academy, a police station and a movie production space, among other things, according to ProPublica.Marisa Novara, the Lightfoot-appointed commissioner of the city’s Department of Housing, estimated in April that Chicago is short by about 120,000 units of affordable housing.[ProPublica] – Rachel HerzogAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The company also owns the parking lot and auto center nearby.Sears has been a key tenant of the Woodfield Mall since it opened in 1971, according to Crain’s. The mall itself is actually named for Sears Chairman Robert Wood as well as entrepreneur Marshall Field.With the Sears location closing, Schaumburg Mayor Tom Dailly said it was the end of an era. Sears, he said, has been a major presence in the village, in Chicago and in the nation.“It’s going to be sad to see that close. I grew up with Sears. I have Sears appliances. All my tools are Sears,” he told the Daily Herald.Sears, the country’s largest retailer until the 1990s, filed for bankruptcy in 2018 in part after its inability to shift into the e-commerce market.Another Sears store in Six Corners in Chicago closed its doors the same year. City planners are discussing rezoning that property for redevelopment. Clark Street Real Estate and Ryan Companies have proposed a renovation project that would convert the building into a residential property.[Crain’s, Daily Herald] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

That pushes the controversial TIF that started as a $300 million makeover of the 340 acres on the Near North side to the city council for approval.It also drives the final price tag on the city’s investment in redevelopment of the projects that once housed as many as 20,000 residents to nearly $1 billion. Cabrini-Green’s TIF ranks as the fourth-largest by revenue among the nearly 140 in the city. It has raised $350 million in taxes as the neighborhood gentrified with condominiums, townhouses and a smattering of retail businesses that include Target and Starbucks. The area also has a new elementary school and public parks.Present day site where Cabrini-Green homes used to stand (Getty)The Chicago Housing Authority, which is the steward of the property owned by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has partnered with developers to build mixed-use housing such as the New City complex but big swaths of vacant land still remain. The CHA has plans to build another 2,300 housing units with a federal mandate that 700 of them include public housing.“CHA and our development partners have now delivered more than 3,500 mixed-income homes to the former Cabrini-Green site,” the CHA said in an emailed statement.But delays caused by the pandemic, materials price hikes and changes in CHA leadership have stalled at least three projects since 2017.“My goal is to get something built on the rest of the CHA properties,” said Alderman Walter Burnett, who spent his youth in Cabrini-Green and now represents the neighborhood. He’s been advocating for affordable and low-income housing on the sites since the late 1990s and, along with Mayor Lori Lightfoot, has been an integral player in extending the TIF. Lightfoot was instrumental in getting the state to agree to extend the Near North TIF district last year.Cabrini-Green in 1966 (Getty)Cabrini-Green has a long history that didn’t always involve drug dealing and gang wars. Construction began in 1942 and the area was once a thriving community of families with limited means spread throughout 23 high-rise buildings and row houses. It evolved into an area rife with crime and drugs in the 1970s, with buildings known for busted elevators, windows and lights as gangs began to control the properties.In 1981, then Mayor Jane Byrne moved into one of the apartments as a means of quelling growing crime and murders there. She only stayed about a week but declared her mission successful.When Mayor Richard M. Daley pushed for the teardown of the project in 1995, he vowed to keep public housing as part of it, telling many residents they would eventually be able to move back in.The last tower came down in 2011 and there’s been limited redevelopment since. Some residents are still waiting to move back in. Last month, Holsten Real Estate Development opened the doors to a 102-unit mixed-income housing development called Elm 551 at Parkside Apartments, the fourth phase of the Parkside of Old Town project completed with the CHA and TIF financing.The CHA has three other parcels in different stages of development, it said. Those include requests for proposals to redevelop 438 vacant row houses with a developer expected to be selected by early next year.Demolition of the Near North High School site, which was held up by the pandemic, is expected to be completed by fall for redevelopment and the final phase of the Parkside development is in the planning process. A new development at Oak and Larrabee streets also is being planned, the CHA said. Those last two are expected to add another 177 homes.To get more going, the community development panel agreed the subsidy is a must-have. “CHA cannot do it alone,” Maurice Cox, head of the city’s Department of Planning and Development and a panel member, said. “These TIF dollars are key.”Assuming the full council gives the go-ahead to the TIF extension and other city permit processes move along in a timely manner, Burnett said the clock is ticking.“We’ve got 10 years to try to get everything in the ground until we don’t have a subsidy to be able to do it,” he said. “I want to fulfill our original commitment to bring back mixed housing. If it was up to me, it would be done already.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

11:00 AM","It was a week of ups and downs for Curt Bailey and Related Midwest, one of the most active and well-capitalized development firms in Chicago.","[""Curt Bailey and\xa0The 78It was a week of ups and downs for Curt Bailey and Related Midwest, one of the most active and well-capitalized development firms in Chicago.On Tuesday, the company learned The 78, its $7 billion “new neighborhood” planned in the South Loop, won’t be the next home of Amazon’s vaunted HQ2, even though it made the company’s final round of consideration. But two days later, the massive project scored approval from the Chicago Plan Commission, putting it on track for its goal to develop up to 6 million square feet on the site by 2022.In part one of a two-part sit-down with The Real Deal, Bailey walked through the first phase of The 78’s construction, and discussed how the company will attract residents and employees to what’s now a 62-acre marsh on the South Branch of the Chicago River. He also talked through Related’s strategy of “operating on the fringes of real estate” to acquire properties with problematic histories.He gave an update on 400 North Lake Shore Drive, where his team is moving forward with a revised plan after the first proposal was shot down by Alderman Brendan Reilly. And he explained why he thinks the current building cycle won’t hit a wall anytime soon, but instead might taper off as construction becomes more expensive.During part two, The Real Deal will ask Bailey about One Bennett Park, Fulton Market and who’s buying condos in Chicago.The following conversation has been edited for length.The 78The last time we spoke was in June, it was fresh off your first public meeting on The 78 …Which was very successful. You rarely leave an initial meeting, especially for a project of that size and scope, and have a feel like that about it. There was so much positive reinforcement that we felt extremely positive about our prospects for moving forward under the parameters that we presented, without any major changes. And that is a function of what we really do well here, which is spending a lot of time thinking about our architecture design, the creation of place, materiality, your sensory perception of where you are, your experience of when you visit someplace. And we also got great ideas and thoughts for people who live there and say, “What about this?” We love to hear those things, and many times we make actual changes to address that feedback, whether it’s from the city or the alderman. It’s extremely valuable and how you get to the creation of a great place.So, keeping in mind that five months may not be a very long time in a project of this scale, can you tell me what’s changed since then? Have any of the ideas brought up during the public meeting been applied to the plan?What I think we’ve done since that time is move forward on every single big part of the program. And the good news is that we have gotten an affirmation of all those things. The Wells-Wentworth [connector] is fully engineered and about to begin. And in a couple months you’ll see work happening out there on that.And when is that supposed to be finished?I believe it’s the beginning of 2020.And at that point, the plan is to start building along that Wells-Wentworth corridor, and go out from there?Yeah, it’s infrastructure and buildings. The buildings will depend on where we are in the market, and the infrastructure will be ongoing. But think about how incredible that will be to drive right down Wells Street, through 62 acres to Downtown Chicago. I think part of the reason the area has sat fallow for so long is that it’s very hard to see it today. You’re traveling fast on Roosevelt Road and you’re 40 feet above it, you can’t see it from Clark Street because there’s a wall, and there are the Metra trains at the southern part of the site. So unless you’re on the river, you really don’t see the site. But when you drive through it, you’ll see the size and scope and proximate nature of all these big successful buildings all around it.Now the Amazon HQ2 guessing game is officially over, can you tell me how close the 78 was to being chosen? Can you confirm they came back in August for a second look at the site?Yes, they made a second visit to our site in the end of August, and the feedback we received was that our site was a top-five site in the country. And so what I would take from that exercise is that of 238 municipalities, you probably had close to 1,000 sites combined, and we were top five. That makes me feel pretty good about our prospects moving forward on The 78 for other companies. Other companies will understand the value of what we can provide there, and what Chicago can provide with access to all these really smart young people who want to live in the city. So I won’t say it wasn’t a disappointment, but the overall takeaway was that we were extremely high in the running for this, and that’s a very positive thing.So when you’re looking at turning a barren expanse of land into a whole new community, where do you start? Walk me through the sequence of building a neighborhood from scratch.We’ve taken a lot of guidepoints from several developments. One is King’s Cross in London, done by our sister company Argent Related, and the other is Hudson Yards in New York, done by our partners at Related. The delivery of Phase One is critically important. When you move into your office building or residential building, it’s got to be a great place to live on day one. So we need to do a number of infrastructure moves before we open a building. And that means the seven-acre park, it means a lot of riverfront, it means the infrastructure connectivity of 15th Street and Wells, so we want those things to deliver in a Phase One deployment. It can be as small as 3 million square feet and large as 6 million square feet. But we want it to be a great place from day one. That’s for the DPI [University of Illinois Discovery Partners Institute] when they open their doors…DPI would be part of that first phase?Yeah. They want to move very fast. They already have a great ongoing program on Wacker Drive, they’re too big for their existing space, and so they want to move quickly. And we want to be very careful about continuing to curate a great place, so we’re looking at how we’re blocking construction from the rest of the site, so you can live there even though some cranes will be around. All those things are going to be very important, and we’re taking lessons from other places that have already done it.So the key will be having all that recreational space in place before any buildings open.A hundred percent. We’re very focused on this. If you want a big office space and you want to be in a high-rise in Downtown Chicago, I’m not going to be able to compete. But if you want office space with enormous floor plates and connectivity within the building and an incredible environment around you where you can go out one door of your building and you have a seven-acre park, and the other door brings you to the riverfront with a half-mile of this 100-foot-wide riverwalk, we’re the act. So we’re trying to build out those things and create that environment, but also tell that story that people can understand and see.Is there a year you’re targeting for the delivery of Phase One?If I had to peg it, I’d say 2022. Maybe 2023.Last month, Alderman Reilly rejected Related’s proposal for 400 North Lake Shore Drive. Where does that project stand now?I think we’re excited to keep moving through the review process as soon as we can, probably at the beginning of next year. We have revised our plan, and we have a spectacular two-building plan designed by Dave Childs that will be a signature piece of the Chicago landscape forever. They’re beautifully designed buildings with terracotta on the outside, something that hasn’t been done in Chicago in close to 100 years. It will be a singularly beautiful place to live, and the location just can’t be duplicated. We love the location, and we look forward to working with the alderman and the neighbors to produce an incredible development.By my count, there are four of these campus-sized mega-developments being planned in the city right now, between The 78, Lincoln Yards, the Tribune River District\xa0and the Michael Reese Hospital redevelopment.\xa0 Why are they all happening at once? Why now?I think it’s a unique set of circumstances that are bringing all these pieces to the market at once. The viability of them became much more clear with a positive real estate market, and the lack of available land. The knock on Chicago has been that there’s always another parking lot to build on, as opposed to New York, which has, like, no available land. But once all those parking lots go away, it becomes much more difficult to find pieces of land to build on. And that’s what we’re getting. If you look at what the city looked like 15 years ago with the availability of parcels compared to today, there really aren’t many left. And it’s more difficult to build.Land is our material. If we were making cars, we would need steel and rubber. But we’re building buildings, and we need land. And you look around, and there’s not a whole lot of land left. So then you look around and say, “Well there’s a big piece of land at the Tribune site.” And people have been talking about the Finkl site for years. People have been talking about [The 78] site for years. And for political and different reasons, they never got developed.So now developers have no choice but to reach for the higher fruit on the tree.Yeah, because the material isn’t there anymore, and so you start to try and figure out how you can get to those bigger ones. That’s why I think there are a number of these big projects out there. They won’t all get done. It’s a big lift. It takes a confluence of a lot of different things.Let’s talk more about the sites that Related has chosen for its big projects since you’ve been with the company [2008]. You have this 62-acre stretch of barren land with a sordid political history. You have a huge, deteriorating public housing complex in the Lathrop Homes whose future was a matter of real controversy. You have an 80-foot hole in the ground at 400 North Lake Shore that’s become this great symbol of failure. 111 West Wacker was not in good shape when Related took over in 2011. Is it on purpose that Related dives head-first into sites with such hardscrabble reputations, or just a coincidence?You’re forgetting about the land we’re building One Bennett Park on, which was another purchase from banks. We also took over three condo buildings in the South Loop during the downturn, rebranded them as Related, put $25 million into their common areas and units, and made those great buildings. So I think it’s more about taking advantage of the downturn to make great real estate plays. And the ability to see past issues to get to great development opportunities. I mean, you can refer to 400 North Lake Shore Drive as an 80-foot hole in the ground, but it’s also two acres where the river meets the lake. I think it’s one of the best pieces of land in the country. So we got to that through some interesting means. We didn’t buy land, we bought debt. We went through the federal bankruptcy process. So we are willing to operate on the fringes of real estate so we can get to these incredible parcels and do special things on them. So yeah, we don’t do small as well as others. We don’t do easy as well as others. I think, given our history and our level of expertise, we do better when it’s big and complicated.One of the points that keeps coming up in Related’s guiding principles for The 78 is this idea of creating a very inclusive and public and open neighborhood that knits together people from all different walks of life. How do you make that happen? How do you create an entire new neighborhood that’s fully inclusive?It gets back to the fundamental question of, what makes a great place? I can’t think of a great place that isn’t all-inclusive and doesn’t have people from every walk of life going to it. It’s important that you make a place where someone can feel comfortable from every single corner of the city. So that’s what we’re going to create, and the natural advantage of our site is that we’re at the crux between Downtown and the South Side. We’re going to be a bridge between Downtown and Chinatown, and Bridgeport, and Pilsen, and Bronzeville and all those different neighborhoods. We want to take different components of all these parts of the city, and bring them into our site. We want people to come from all over the world, all over the country, all over the region, all over Chicago, every neighborhood. Overall success will be determined by whether it can be a place where tourists want to be, a place where people who live and work there want to be, and a place where people from surrounding neighborhoods want to go. That is extremely hard to do, but it’s the only barometer for success. Think of Millennium Park. Everyone loves Millennium Park. Tourists love it and Chicagoans love it. People who live around there love to go there. And that is what you take lessons from.We recently wrote a feature trying to look at the impact of the affordability pilot zones that were established last year, and during our reporting we heard everything from, “it’s impossible to get anything build inside the pilot zones” to “developers are overreacting, and they can hit the affordability benchmarks if they really want to.” Where do you fall on that question?I think I was the only developer who stood up and supported the [2015 affordability requirements ordinance]. And we continue to support any program for affordable housing in the city of Chicago. I think affordable housing is wildly important for us. It’s one of the key barometers of success for any city in the world, and we will continue to get creative and do whatever we can to deliver affordable housing in Chicago. That being said, cooperation is absolutely key, and everybody from the city to the housing department to the aldermen working together is important to be able to being able to get over these … to build units on these rules, which are important but tough to do sometimes to make the numbers work.Complete the following sentence. Over the next 20 years, whether Chicago remains a broadly affordable city will depend on …I think it clearly will be an affordable city. You look at our competitive cities, and we are in the most affordable city on the housing side of it by a mile. New York, L.A., San Francisco, Boston, D.C. … Chicago is a better city than all of them but New York. It’s bigger, it’s got more culture, it has more interesting things. We are very affordable here in the city.Right, but what can developers and city policymakers do to preserve that, to make sure Chicago’s housing market doesn’t become more like any of those other cities?We won’t. It’s an impossibility. Because we’re able to build at levels that they’re not able to build at. It would take such a sea change for us to become a market priced at those levels. Chicago is a very affordable place to be today, on the grand scale, and I think that will continue to be the case. I think we’ll see price appreciation here on both the rent and and the sales side, but compared against our competitor cities we continue to be an affordable place to live.One obligatory last question: do you see an end in sight for the current building cycle? What signs are you watching most closely to see whether we’re getting to that point?Well, people have been talking about whether we’re in the seventh or the eighth inning or whatever. We’re not looking at people who opine on what inning it is — we look at the numbers. We look at the growth of the population of Downtown Chicago vis-a-vis deliveries, and that gap is widening, not shrinking. And if you look at the vacancy rates in existing buildings — I mean, is there an available built apartment in Chicago right now? There are more people moving into Chicago than we’re delivering units for. So that makes me feel relatively OK about where we are. The ARO is making it tougher to get financed, building prices are going up, the banks are pulling back a bit. It’s getting harder to build a building than it was several years ago, which means you’re going to slow down in production. And as the population continues to go up, there’s going to be less apartments, and you’re going to see rents go up.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",400 North Lake Shore Drive

One of the key details Crain’s unearthed was that between the two towers, 202 condos sold for $1 million or more so far in 2021. Compared to the rest of downtown, St. Regis and Tribune Tower sold about 1.4 times as many luxury-priced condos as all of the other buildings combined.“These are big buildings,” Gail Lissner, senior managing director of Integra Realty Resources and a longtime analyst of the downtown condo market, told Crain’s. “They’d be doing big numbers, no matter what.”The St. Regis, which was formerly known as Wanda Vista and later Vista Tower, is located on the south bank of the Chicago River at 363 East Wacker Drive. The 95-story supertall was designed by Studio Gang and features multi-hued glass on the exterior. The 34-story Tribune Tower, located across the river at 435 Michigan Avenue, was converted into condos after the Chicago Tribune left the building in 2018.Two additional residential projects have recently joined Chicago’s downtown market. The 47-story Cirrus in Lakeshore East and 75-story One Chicago tower near Holy Name Cathedral don’t have finished condos to offer to buyers yet.The management team for the St. Regis has been cagey in releasing details about the tower’s sales. Crain’s contacted the team and was told that sales have exceeded expectations and that the tower is “approximately 60 percent sold or under contract.” According to the paper’s research, however, the building’s developer, Magellan, has closed sales for 151 units out of the 353 in the St. Regis tower, putting it at 42 percent sold.While developers rarely publish contracts that aren’t closed, Redfin estimates that Magellan has marked 18 units under contract, which adds 5 percent to the total. The St. Regis units with pending sales include two priced at more than $9 million and another priced above $10 million. Crain’s looked but couldn’t find any records that confirmed an $18.5 million contract for the 10,640-square-foot unit on the entire 71st and 72nd floors that Magellan announced in 2018.As for the Tribune Tower, developers Golub Realty and CIM Group sold 51 of the 151 condos available in the building, or 33 percent. The tower’s sales director Jeanne Martini told Crain’s that the number, with pending contracts added, would be “right at 50 percent.”Martini said seven units went under contract in the week of Nov. 15, in part because a model unit opened a few weeks ago, providing potential buyers the opportunity to experience what the living space is actually like.[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",363 East Wacker Drive

It’s almost fully leased after the Inspire11 deal, and AmTrust plans to spend $100 million to upgrade most of its Loop buildings.Local officials are prodding investors and Loop landlords, especially on LaSalle Street, where older buildings have struggled with vacancy in recent years, to make similar commitments to update and potentially convert parts of some properties to uses like student housing.Amenity space at 1 North Dearborn will be needed by Inspire11 employees to work in on some days. Its new offices could get crowded if there are days when many of its local employees, which could soon total 400 after a hiring push this year, head into the office.“We were willing to take the bet that on those days, people would go (work) in more general areas of the building,” company CEO Alban Mehmeti told Crain’s.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1 East Wacker Drive

The loan from HFF replaces old debt Waterton inherited from Crescent Heights as part of its deal in June.Crescent Heights paid $237 million in 2016 to acquire the 55-story tower at 175 North Harbor Drive from the Florida State Board of Administration, Crain’s reported at the time.Waterton did not disclose how much it paid to pick up the property two years later, but it was “pretty close” to what Crescent Heights had paid, according to Steve Carlson, senior vice president of debt and capital markets at Waterton. Aside from some light renovations to common spaces, the previous owner didn’t add much to the property, Carlson said.Waterton plans to tap existing capital to fund the work, instead of taking out new debt, Carlson added. He did not say whether Waterton would tap its $920 million multifamily investment fund to bankroll the project.The building was completed in 1988, and about 500 of its units have hardly seen any update in the last decade, Carlson said. During the next few years, Waterton plans to replace the appliances, cabinets, countertops, lighting and floors in those units.“There’s a pretty substantial difference between some of the renovated product on the market and where current rents are on un-renovated units,” Carlson said, “so we think there will be a pretty good return on investor capital.”The tower includes a mix of units ranging from studios through three-bedrooms, with rents starting around $1,800 for a 465-square-foot studio, according to its website.At 958 square feet, the average apartment is larger than most competitors’, part of what drew Waterton to the tower in the first place, Carlson said. He did not say how high the firm plans to raise rents post-renovation.Carlson called the Lakeshore East area an “insulated pocket” that could avoid competition for renters among the frenzy of multifamily construction rising from River North and the South Loop. But with Magellan Development Group planning a crop of new high-rises in the area, it may not stay that way for long.After it completes the 101-story Vista Tower next year, Magellan will build four new residential towers, three of them in partnership with Lendlease on opposite ends of the 28-acre neighborhood combining for up to 2,340 units.Waterton plans to hang onto North Harbor Tower for about another four years, Carlson said.The investment firm lists eight Chicago properties in its portfolio, with investments in 13 other states. At the end of last year, Waterton claimed about $4.9 billion in assets.In January, the firm announced that it had bought a controlling share in senior housing operator Pathway to Living, with plans to expand the brand across the country.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",175 North Harbor Drive

Xeris’ move also marks another departure from LaSalle Street through the Loop, a corridor that’s been struggling to retain office tenants since even before the pandemic.Xeris signed a 13-year lease for 87,000 square feet at 1375 West Fulton Street. The new lease is an expansion for the company, which previously leased 40,000 square feet at 180 North LaSalle Street and 11,000 square feet in the Fulton Street building.With the deal, Xeris becomes the anchor tenant of the 14-story Trammel Crow-developed building that includes lab space for multiple life sciences companies, including Vanqua Bio, Talis Biomedical and Charles River Laboratories.Xeris CEO Paul Edick said the company was eager to consolidate its footprint into one of the buildings it already occupied. Kyle Kamin of CBRE, negotiated the new lease on behalf of Xeris, while Kelsey Scheive, also of CBRE, represented the landlord.The expanded lease is positive news for Chicago, which historically has lost growing pharmaceutical companies like Xeris to other more mature life sciences markets such as Boston or San Francisco. Developers have worked to address the main problem, which is a lack of high-quality and well-located lab space, by including that kind of space in more properties near the heart of the city.The firm will list the 40,000 square feet it occupied at 190 North LaSalle on the sublease market, adding to a record amount of downtown secondary space already available.Trammell Crow built the 14-floor, 301,000-square-foot 1375 West Fulton as the first phase of its Fulton Labs project, and earlier this year completed the second at 400 North Aberdeen Street, a 16-story, 420,000-square-foot project.Before Google finalized its purchase of the Thompson Center in the Loop, the tech company was reportedly considering expanding its Fulton Market presence by up to 200,000 square feet at the Aberdeen building but later dropped that option. readmore title=”Read more”][/readmore]— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",375 West Fulton Street

I think it will be for hopefully less than 12 months.”The Loop’s landlords will be particularly vulnerable to losses that bars and restaurants face in the era of social distancing, even after Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order is rescinded.A potential silver lining is that with limited demand, rents will fall and construction costs for build-outs will also drop, Vance told Crain’s.Bloomberg reported last week that some retail owners collected as little as 15 percent of what they were owed.Landlords, facing potential defaults of their own, are telling large corporate tenants that they won’t be getting any breaks. Others say the federal government should step in and cover the costs.“The landlords are triaging the battlefield,” said Gene Spiegelman, vice chairman at Ripco Real Estate Corp. “The super powerful and strong are not going to get any help and the ones that’ll die anyways, landlords will say why would I help them?”Vance told the outlet that he didn’t expect a “V” shaped recovery in Chicago.“Hopefully, it’s a U and not an L,” he said.

The 503-unit Cascade will also include a publicly accessible green space that will connect the property to the lakefront and Chicago Riverwalk.Favorite son Barack Obama’s presidential library is number two on the list based on the initial cost estimate of $145 million listed in the permit, but that figure has since ballooned to $830 million. The project sparked controversy with its placement on 19 acres of Chicago’s historic Jackson Park, and was delayed by a lawsuit calling it an appropriation of public space. But the Obama Presidential Center won’t be a conventional presidential library, as the 44th president’s papers will be digitized rather than archived there, and the venue is geared more towards hosting concerts, cultural events, summits and similar programming.The Reed, a 41-story residential tower, placed third with its $130 million price tag. It will be split between 224 rental units on floors nine through 22 and 216 condominiums from floors 23 through 41.A 43-story, $112 million tower in Fulton Market will reach 495 feet into the sky in West Loop. It will include ground-floor retail and 300 rental units, 60 of which will be earmarked as affordable.Power Construction Company is building a $100 million, four-story medical office building in Irving Park for Northwestern Medicine.Onni Development Group’s $99 million, 33-story residential tower will bring 373 rental units to the Fulton River District.An $82 million project in Portage Park will feature senior living facilities, with 114 independent living units, 98 assisted living units, and 46 memory care units.A $68 million 22-story mixed-use building is going up in the Illinois Medical District.Sterling Bay’s $64 million project in Lincoln Yards will feature 280,000 square feet of Class A medical research lab space.The $59 million Joint Public Safety Training Campus is going up in Humboldt Park.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

02:44 PM","Self-storage, once regarded as a niche investment, is looking better than ever.","[""Recession-proof self-storage market heads into second boom (iStock)Self-storage, once regarded as a niche investment, is looking better than ever.Occupancy rates at self-storage facilities nationwide jumped to 94.5 percent in 2021 from 91 percent from pre-pandemic 2019. Average monthly costs for a 10′ by 10′ climate-controlled storage unit rose 10.5 percent to $146.72 in the second quarter of 2021 from the same period two years earlier, according to the 2022 Self-Storage Almanac.For self-storage companies across America, the pandemic meant a surge in business as spare rooms and garages were turned into home offices. Now there’s a second boom as people work from home, or plan to return to offices, or a combination of the two, making self-storage a durable business. While offices plan to bring back employees, the need for self-storage will be driven by people migrating into cities from rural or suburban areas, prompting the need to downsize. The rise in home prices, more likely to result in people moving to smaller spaces, may add to reasons why they want to sign up for self-storage use.“When people think of commercial real estate, they think of apartments and office buildings, but storage has proven to be a great business and has garnered incremental capital to invest in the asset class,” said Juan Sanabria, managing director of BMO Capital Markets.Since the start of the pandemic, the five U.S. publicly traded self-storage real estate investment trusts – Public Storage, Cube Smart, Extra Space Storage, Life Storage, and National Storage Affiliates Trust – gained an average of 142.8 percent. They outperformed the S&P 500’s return of 93.7 percent over the two years from March 16, 2020, the day after the country started shutting down businesses and schools.The best performer was Life Storage, which jumped almost three-fold to about $134 from $49 during that period. Even the worst performer, Public Storage, which accounts for about half the $125 billion market capitalization of the five REITs, gained about 109 percent.Self-storage firms are capitalizing on the rising tide. CubeSmart closed on a $1.7 billion acquisition of Storage West in December. The public company owned at least 1,200 properties as of late 2020 and has only expanded since then. In November, Public Storage bought the 56 self-storage facilities from All Storage for $1.5 billion, expanding its portfolio by about 36 million net rentable square feet since 2019.The self-storage market is one of the rare industries that perform well both during good and bad times, driven by the four traditional D’s – death, divorce, downsizing, and dislocation. “Self storage executives see robust demand not only from traditional drivers but from two additional Ds: decluttering and distribution/business demand,” according to Yardi Matrix, a platform providing commercial real estate market data.Operators are also looking to new uses for self-storage properties, including for distribution and logistics facilities. Properties near population centers “are perfectly located for last-mile delivery,” Joseph Saffire, chief executive of Life Storage, told Yardi Matrix.The asset class also benefits from customers’ tendency to be “sticky,” an industry term for long-term users who are reluctant to switch units even when rents increase. For users, self-storage monthly payments are a small expense compared with mortgages, car payments, and school tuition, while the value of their belongings is high, said Sean Delaney, Marcus & Millichap’s senior vice president investments.“If they’re renting a storage unit and they’ve got all their belongings, they’re not going to not pay the bill that’s arguably one of the lower expenses of the monthly budget,” said Delaney.Pulling out from storage can also translate into higher rents because the owners can charge prices according to the current market rather than locked into a lower rate.Developers seeking to build new self-storage facilities face high barriers to entry. Municipalities can limit where structures go, zoning approvals can take months, escalating construction costs, and supply chain difficulties combined mean it may take as much as five years before a new facility is fully leased.That’s been good for the Storage Acquisition Group, which buys and sells existing self-storage facilities. The company eclipsed $350 million in deals last year, an increase of 25 percent from the pandemic.“In urban areas like Chicago, where you can pay a lot less per square foot, it makes sense to just have your necessities in your living area and then have a storage facility that’s down the street.” said Monty Spencer, president of the Storage Acquisition Group.Even with those barriers to entry, overbuilding remains the biggest threat to the sector’s continued success. It’s happened before.The excess supply growth of self-storage starting in 2016 pushed up vacancy rates through 2019 with the Southwest part of the country reaching almost 15 percent and the South Atlantic states about 14 percent.“I think we have peaked in terms of the bumps we got from COVID,” Stephen Clark II of the Clark Investment Group, a real estate developer specializing in self-storage, told the Chicago Tribune. A lot of that will stick because people like having the space. But if this prompts overbuilding, it could be ruinous.”Continued growth in self-storage also hinges in part on Americans’ reluctance to let go of their stuff. And for those people who fail to pay their rent, their long-hoarded belongings could end up with a starring role on the 14-season reality show Storage Wars, in which bidders make offers on locked storage units sight unseen.“As the industry evolves, the demand drivers keep changing and more storage gets built,” said Marcus & Millichap’s Delaney. “It’s hard to say what all the demand drivers are. The one thing for sure is that it’s a culture. We’re consumers by nature and most people don’t like to throw things out.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",91 percent from pre-pandemic 2019.

04:32 PM",The battle for broker talent in Chicago is heating up.,"[""Tomoko Asai and Marianne Daly (@properties, iStock)The battle for broker talent in Chicago is heating up.After Compass signed @properties’ seven-agent Schwabe Group, its top producer returned to the Chicago-based brokerage after three days, @properties told The Real Deal. The brokerage also said another agent parted ways with Schwabe Group to stay at @properties when the team signed with Compass.Compass confirmed Tomoko Asai returned to @properties and Marianne Daly never joined from the Schwabe Group, making it a six-agent team.Asai decided to return to @properties because of the support she’s received and the opportunity the brokerage is offering to expand her business, she said.“I doubled my business and became a top producer with over $10 million in sales within the past two years at @properties,” said Asai. “Staying with @properties was the right decision especially when my managing broker was giving me more opportunities,” she added.Asai represented $12 million, about a third of Schwabe’s $40 million sales volume last year, @properties said. Daly posted about $3 million in sales volume for Schwabe Group in 2021, the brokerage added. Daly didn’t respond to requests for comment.Since Compass opened its Chicago office in 2017, it recruited several top producers away from @properties including new development specialist Heather Gusfafson and agents Cindi Sodolski and Jordan Euson. Most recently, Pam MacPherson, who led her team to $100 million in residential transactions in 2021, bounced back to @properties after fulfilling their two-year contract with Compass.Amid its ongoing franchise expansion, @properties made a stronger push into the luxury market by rebranding to add Christie’s International Real Estate. @properties bought the luxury real estate arm of the art auction house in December, hoping for another growth stream.The brokerage, founded in 2000 by Wong and Michael Golden, ranked eighth in the Real Trend’s list of largest residential brokerages in the U.S. by sales volume in 2020.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

08:00 AM",Just how much has Chicago’s construction market slumped? The city’s top five contractors fell short of $1 billion of work last year – the same amount that just two accomplished during a year-long period ending in 2018.,"[""Lendlease’s Ted Weldon and Kinjal Patel; 455 East WatersideJust how much has Chicago’s construction market slumped? The city’s top five contractors fell short of $1 billion of work last year – the same amount that just two accomplished during a year-long period ending in 2018.Leading the 2021 rankings was Lendlease, even as it underperformed its historical local average, according to an analysis by The Real Deal of reported costs on building permits for projects started between Jan. 1 and Dec. 7 last year. The rest of the top five, in order, consists of Power Construction, Executive Construction, Turner Construction and Related’s in-house construction manager LR Contracting.The down year hasn’t crushed the optimism of Ted Weldon, who runs Lendlease’s development branch in Chicago. He’s still bullish on his home town, brushing aside concern about Illinois’ population loss and pointing instead to downtown residential growth that’s topping any other U.S. city.“People are flowing out of Illinois, but into the central business district,” Weldon said in an interview. “We expect the next five years of continued growth, and of the tech sector especially into Chicago, bringing more jobs in. We see that as an opportunity for more multifamily.”Expectations for a recovery are tempered, though signs have emerged it has already begun. Residential projects will keep expanding their market share, as will infrastructure work, while the commercial market share is on pace to slip in 2022 by a little less than 1 percent after dropping 7.8 percent last year, according to research firm Cummings. The overall market is forecast to grow 3 percent this year.”The market is going to rebound,” said Michael Cwienkala, president of the Chicagoland Associated General Contractors trade group. “Maybe not to pre-pandemic levels, but hopefully near pre-pandemic levels. We continue to be pretty conservative with our market projection.”Last year’s slow market masked some surprises. While commercial projects’ market share sank by almost 8 percent overall, the sagging market for new office buildings thrust multifamily, usually a small proportion, to the forefront as its share rose by about the same percentage.Multifamily accounted for the two most expensive building permits issued in the period: the $150 million, 503-unit Cascade apartments across 37 stories at 455 Waterside Drive in Lakeshore East, and the $130 million, 440-unit mixed-use apartment and condo structure Reed at Southbank at 234 West Polk Street along the Chicago River in the South Loop. Lendlease developed both, with Magellan serving as a partner on the Cascade, and oversaw construction on each as general contractor.Life sciences projects also made up a bigger portion of the total than usual as some developers turned to lab-like facilities, which are difficult or impossible to replicate at home, from traditional office developments. The first such project in Sterling Bay’s Lincoln Yards pulled a $64.7 million permit for Power Construction to build the Ally lab building at 1229 West Concord Place.“There’s a lot of activity in the life science market,” said Kate VanZeyl at New York-based Turner, ranked No. 4.Although that permit ranked eighth-priciest in the year, it was the biggest new construction start for anything remotely considered a conventional commercial workplace. That’s a big change from 2020, when the city’s top two construction permits were for the $476 million BMO Harris Bank tower near Union Station and the $360 million Wolf Point South tower.Contractors needed just eight construction cranes in October, down from 18 in March 2020 and well below 62 in 2017, said McHugh Construction President Mike Meagher, whose company finished No. 9 in the contractor ranking for the year at $99 million. The firm, founded in 1897and propelled to prominence for its high-rise work on the Marina City towers in the 1960s, ranked ninth in 2021, coming in just shy of $99 million with its reported costs on permits.“For most, 2021 was a very challenging year,” Meagher said. “There was hesitation and uncertainty that played a major factor during 2021 for developers, and investors as well, deciding to put dollars into Chicago or not.”The market picked up in last year’s second half, Meagher said. His firm resumed work late in the year on the 805-foot, 73-story 1000M apartment building on Michigan Avenue, after pausing early in the pandemic. Developers Time Equities and JK Equities changed plans, switching to build more than 700 apartments instead of the more than 500 condos originally pitched for the site.Two other developers’ in-house construction teams – Related’s LR Contracting and Onni Development’s builder – also finished in The Real Deal’s ranking. Related’s in-house builder, LR, finished fifth with $123 million. The bulk of its work was on the city’s third-largest contract last year, the 43-story, 300-unit apartment building at 900 West Randolph Street in Fulton Market. Bowa Construction co-managed the project, becoming the first minority-owned construction firm to build a Chicago highrise.“We have great subcontractors here, we have great general contractors here,” said LR’s Don Biernacki. “It’s exciting to be working on a project like 900. It’s exciting to be in Fulton Market.”Onni Group’s construction firm ranked No. 7 at $103 million, almost all of it for the 32-story, 373-unit Fulton River District residential building at 354 North Union Avenue, the city’s fourth biggest contract in 2021.Normally, in-house contracting work makes up 30 percent of Lendlease’s business while the rest are jobs awarded by third-party developers, Weldon said. That mix shifted in 2021 as more than $280 million in reported costs on permits stemmed from the two residential towers, Cascade and the Reed, among a total of $302 million-worth of work performed by Lendlease across all its permits.Lendlease’s construction arm was still busy working for developers other than those it employs, too. It drew a $3.5 million permit when it was hired by MCZ Development for the first phase of the 21-story, 224-apartment project at 166 North Aberdeen Street, an area where more than 9,000 housing units are in various stages of planning. Lendlease so far has put $5.2 million into that property, and the company landed another residential permit to start the first $3.5 million of work from developer CMK Development for a 30-story, 299-unit building at 1400 South Wabash Avenue that will likely end up costing $100 million. Both are slated to open in 2023.“The 2021 construction value is markedly lower than Lendlease’s historical averages,” said Kinjal Patel, the company’s general manager of construction in Chicago. “However, we see the future pipeline as optimistic to regain operating rhythm.”Local players dominated the rest of the field, taking seven of the top 10 spots. While eighth-place Onni is headquartered in Vancouver, and New York-based Turner landed in the top five at $127 million, carried in part by more than $20 million of work for the Obama Presidential Center, and Indiana’s Hunt Construction was eighth at $99 million, Chicago-based firms took the remainder of the top spots.Power Construction’s $214 million of work led the way among locals. It landed 62 permits, more than all but one other firm in the top 10, Skender Construction, which ranked 10th at $94 million with 63. Power, The Real Deal’s top contractor in Chicago in 2019 by square footage, declined to comment.Power’s largest contract in 2021 was for $65 million of work on a life science lab at 1229 West Concord Place, the first building in the $6 billion Lincoln Yards megadevelopment by Sterling Bay on the North Side.“Power is a known commodity in Chicago, just like McHugh, just like Lendlease,” said Troy Imke of Mark Goodman and Associates, a developer planning a life sciences lab at 400 North Elizabeth Street just northwest of Google’s offices in Fulton Market.Power’s long relationship with Northwestern Medicine has helped get it work on life science projects for the health care system and others, and Chicago wants to lure more development of its lab sector, which could help lift contractors out of last year’s slump.Power also pulled permits for $11 million of work for the Fulton Labs property at 1375 West Fulton Street, construction of which cost $16 million with Skender chipping in more than $5 million. That property was an example of how a developer, Trammell Crow, incorporated a lab into its traditional office design before building began.Even as downtown Chicago offices outside Fulton Market emptied during the pandemic, contractors found big jobs for office renovations last year. More than $2.3 billion went into all types of renovations and alterations last year on more than 6,000 permits, compared with $1.8 billion total of new construction on less than 1,000 permits.Chicago’s market for office renovations is growing. It’s split between landlords sprucing up older structures with amenities to compete with the newest buildings in the hot Fulton Market district featuring lounges, bars and rooftop decks for workers; and renovations of the huge amount of tenant spaces vacated or put onto the sublease market by tenants.\nGardner Construction, which finished No. 14 in the market by dollar volume, won Chicago’s biggest office renovation project for just under $62 million of work on the eight-story building at 801 South Canal Street. Executive Construction, Chicago’s No. 3 contractor for 2021, landed the second largest office renovation for $55 million on a first-time tenant buildout at 433 West Van Buren Street. Turner handled the third most costly office renovation for almost $50 million across three floors at 131 South Dearborn Street.“The other piece of our business that has experienced a tremendous amount of growth is our special projects division,” said Turner’s VanZeyl. “That’s a group of individuals in our business unit focused on fast-paced projects. They respond quickly to clients’ needs, with a significant amount of work in the interiors market.”Office renovations are Executive’s specialty, along with work on projects like data centers and new office construction, and it doesn’t work on residential projects.“We came into 2021 with a very low backlog,” said Executive’s Dave Hetrick. “Work that had been lined up was canceled or postponed. We have seen a strong rebound in the tenant interior market in Chicago, though, in the past nine to 12 months, and the forecast for the next six to 12 months looks strong in that market.”The fate of Loop depends on investment into more renovations.Old buildings losing out on new business tenants to the latest wave of development probably need renovations and fancier amenities, or conversions into housing for students, seniors and downtown workers. AmTrust Realty has agreed to spend $100 million to improve its Loop portfolio, a move that already yielded a lease from a law firm in one of the properties.“I do think the tide is turning,” Meagher said. “This year looks exponentially better than 2021. Last year you saw a lot of institutional money that was speculative about the city of Chicago. This year you see them buying into the vision for the city.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",37 stories at 455 Waterside Drive

04:00 PM",Tell us how we can help you.,"[""Property tax attorney Molly Phelan, real estate consultant Jennifer Tammen, accountant Marina Pedersen and Alderman Walter Burnett (27th) (Credit: Alex Nitkin)Tell us how we can help you.That was Alderman Walter Burnett’s (27th) plea to the more than 100 real estate professionals who gathered Wednesday for a discussion on Chicago’s increasingly rocky property tax landscape, which one attorney said has investors “terrified” to back projects in the region.With Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi’s new math cranking up the pressure on commercial property owners and new Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s predictions for more tax hikes in this year’s budget, policymakers are in the market for new ideas to keep the development pipeline open, Burnett said.“We have a blank canvas now, so I think people in y’all’s position should come up with ideas and present them to the city to see what can be incorporated as an incentive,” Burnett told attendees at a luncheon hosted by CREW, a network focused on promoting women in the commercial real estate industry.“I know we’re going to have to stay attractive in order to be competitive .. .so this is a great time to come up with those ideas,” Burnett added.The alderman was an architect of a 2017 expansion of the city’s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, requiring developers to set aside up to 20 percent of units in new apartment and condo buildings as affordable housing in exchange for zoning approval. The rule drew a backlash from builders and some investors, who say the requirements are squeezing developers out of gentrifying neighborhoods.Burnett has defended the controversial program, but he told The Real Deal after the event Wednesday city leaders are now re-examining it.“The mayor is very concerned about affordable housing being incorporated in the market-rate communities … . Of course, they have to look at other avenues of incentives for those kinds of things to happen,” Burnett said.The mayor and her new housing commissioner, Marisa Novara, “have some ideas, and there may be some changes” to the policy, Burnett added. He declined to say their specific ideas.If those changes don’t come, the combination of higher assessments and Cook County’s relatively high tax rates might scare away builders who were still open to working in the area, according to Jennifer Tammen, a real estate consultant in Ernst & Young’s Chicago office.Tammen said she found one Evanston commercial property that traded hands for $9 million in 2015, whose fair market value the assessor pegged at $2.5 million in 2018. This year, the building’s fair market value increased $8.8 million despite no physical improvements, Tammen said.“If I’m a developer going in, and instead of 25 or 30 percent of my rent going to taxes, now it’s jumping to 50 or 60 percent, I cannot make that deal work,” Tammen said. “You’re not going to be able to get tenants.”Property owners are also worried Kaegi’s staff will base its assessments on “intangible” attributes of buildings that add to their income, instead of zeroing in on the “bricks and sticks” of each property’s physical value, said Molly Phelan, a property tax attorney at the firm Siegel Jennings.“That’s why we have so many investors terrified to come into this market,” Phelan said. “They have no idea what’s going to be happening with property taxes, and it’s absolutely impossible to predict.”Kaegi is pushing to get county commissioners to beef up his office, which an independent auditor last month called understaffed. The assessor also proposed a state law to mandate commercial property owners report their income, but the bill fizzled in Springfield this spring.But even before Kaegi took over, assessments in the city were headed for a steep hike. County officials released data last week based on 2018 assessments that will increase Downtown and North Side homeowners’ tax bills by more than 11 percent on average, even as tax rates declined.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Until recently, the property held a Target, which shuttered last year amid protests by local activists.In a statement, the president of Blue Cross of Illinois parent Health Care Service Corp. said the project seeks to improve the community and address “societal factors, such as joblessness.”Health Care Services also expanded earlier this year to the supertall Aon Center.“This facility represents the type of collaboration, partnership and investment we need to improve the lives of residents while also boosting the economic development of our communities,” said Mayor Lori Lightfoot in a statement. Lightfoot sharply criticized real estate developers in her May inaugural address.DL3 and Blue Cross did not receive state or city incentives on the project, Crain’s reported.The Morgan Park Center is expected to open in the second quarter of 2020 and bring 550 jobs to the area. The price tag for the deal was undisclosed, but appears to be the first big move since HCSC CEO Paula Steiner and CFO Eric Feldstein departed last month.DL3, led by Leon Walker, recently helped build a new Jewel-Osco grocery store and plans to demolish and redevelop the Washington Park Bank building in Woodlawn. Walker told The Real Deal earlier this year that he also plans to buy and reposition another closed South Side Target store in Chatham.DL3 also recently joined rapper Common to propose a 128-acre film production campus and is planning several other redevelopment projects in the South Side with developer Sterling Bay.

12:04 PM",Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi hasn’t followed through on a vow to comply with all outstanding Freedom of Information Act requests.,"[""Fritz Kaegi (Twitter via fritz4assessor, iStock)Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi hasn’t followed through on a vow to comply with all outstanding Freedom of Information Act requests.Despite his campaign promise to make his office more transparent, Kaegi’s administration has failed to fulfill 26 percent of the requests — about 2,800 — to release internal records it received between early 2020 and May 2022, Crain’s reported.Crain’s, which filed its own FOIA request for a list of all of the public records requests Kaegi’s office had received since 2014, had to wait six weeks for that information, far longer than the five-day turnaround the law requires. According to the data, it takes an average of 53 days for Kaegi’s office to complete a FOIA request.Kaegi’s 2018 campaign focused on boosting transparency after his predecessor Joseph Berrios was ousted from office due, in part, to his resistance to release assessment data. According to Chief Deputy Assessor Sarah Garza Resnick, the records from before 2020 aren’t accurate, because they show Berrios fulfilled all 177,000 requests he received from 2014 to 2018 but don’t include information about whether the requests were answered or denied. In addition, the list of requests Berrios’ office said were fulfilled didn’t include any from the media.Kaegi’s team also found an additional 19,000 FOIA-related emails that had been sent to Berrios’ FOIA manager that could include information requests that weren’t in any official log.According to top assessor staff, Kaegi has prioritized releasing data in ways that make FOIA requests unnecessary, like regularly publishing visitor logs, township valuation reports and his models for assessing properties.“Transparency should not be measured solely by FOIA, but by what an office is willing to release publicly,” Kaegi’s spokesman Scott Smith told Crain’s. “At that, we’ve wildly excelled and will continue to excel. We’re the only assessor’s office in the country to put this data out there as to how every single assessment is calculated.”Kaegi’s office says they have improved on fulfilling FOIA requests recently and that it now takes an average of three days to provide the information, compared with the average 80 days it took to fulfill requests in the third quarter of 2021.Garza Resnick and Smith said they realize the office has shortcomings. They blamed part of that on the paper-based system that was left to them by the Berrios administration. Their office is looking for funding to digitize old records because many have been misplaced or are stored in an off-site warehouse.The assessor’s longtime head of FOIA was resistant to the revamped request system where the public could file and track requests online and, according to Garza Resnick, was let go six months after being put on a performance improvement plan.A new interim manager has been appointed and is in the process of fulfilling requests that have been delayed.[CCB] — Victoria Pruitt\xa0\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Goulart and CME Group’s Terrence A. Duffy along with 550 West Washington Boulevard (MetLife, CME Group, Google Maps)One of Chicago’s biggest office tenants looks ready to exit much of its space in a West Loop building next year after listing about 130,000 square feet for sublease.CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, has been marketing most of its space at 550 West Washington Boulevard at $32.50 per square foot, according to a Colliers listing. The lease term expires next year and a direct lease extension is available.The listing is among record office supply in downtown Chicago’s secondary market, where 6.2 million square feet was available for sublease in the second quarter, the brokerage MBRE found. Companies with leases expiring soon have turned to subleases as a preference for remote work endures even with the virus receding.Offering a sublease gives tenants a chance to cut their real estate costs as they prepare to rethink office needs, increasingly resulting in companies deciding to shrink their workplaces and make attending in person optional for at least a day or two per week.CME’s cutback at Washington isn’t the company’s first recent move to unload real estate. In November, it sold a 300,000-square-foot building at 333 South LaSalle Street for $39.5 million to electric utility ComEd, which is turning what used to be the Chicago Board of Trade’s largest trading floor into a power substation.The ComEd deal was a sale-leaseback: CME occupied the building this year ahead of moving into 145,000 square feet nearby at 141 West Jackson Boulevard, a two-building complex CME also formerly owned that it sold to a venture of GlenStar Properties and USAA Real Estate for $152 million in 2012. The Jackson property now hosts the exchange manager’s trading floor, as well as the Cboe’s.With the reduction from its 245,000 square feet leased in 2006 at the 16-story, 372,000-square-foot Washington building, CME is unraveling a 2006 shift of much of its Chicago workforce from its longtime headquarters at 20 South Wacker Drive.The Washington building was bought by MetLife Investment Management for $112 million in 2012. The CME lease there expanded the exchange’s Chicago offices from its Wacker location, a Tishman Speyer-owned complex called the CME Center. The property’s namesake tenant has increased its lease there to 575,000 square feet on a deal expiring in 2032 through several expansions since January 2018, when the company started adding to the 490,000 square feet it had at the time, SEC filings show.The company decided several years ago to relocate most of its Chicago-based employees to its headquarters, and has trimmed its use of the Washington building as its Wacker space has been expanded and renovated in stages, a CME spokesperson said in an email.If much of CME’s space in the MetLife building goes unclaimed on the secondary market ahead of its lease expiration next year, the landlord will be dealing with a building almost half vacant. It’s already facing a 13 percent direct vacancy rate, a figure that doesn’t reflect CME’s unused space on the secondary market, brokerage MBRE reported. CME’s sublease is the largest among Chicago’s 30 newest buildings of 300,000 square feet or more.A MetLife spokesperson declined to comment on the cutback, and Tishman didn’t return requests for comment.

Randolph (top) and Marquette Companies’ planned apartment building at 1440 W. Randolph St. in the Fulton Market DistrictDespite receiving approval from the city’s Plan Commission on Thursday, the developers of two Fulton Market projects still have a lot to figure out.On Thursday, the city’s Plan Commission approved the construction of a 16-story Standard Hotel and an additional 11-story apartment building, both located on W. Randolph St. But many have voiced their concerns over the construction due to the increase in traffic and proximity to Union Park.The 259-room hotel, a venture by New York-based DDG and Chicago-based Marc Realty, will be located at 1234 W. Randolph St. in the West Loop/Fulton Market area. The hotel will not provide any parking options and will rely solely on valet services, causing a huge increase in traffic in the already congested area. A neighbor complained at last month’s meeting, according to Block Club.A supervising zoning plan examiner on the project, Noah Szafraniec, said he wouldn’t sign off on the project until he saw a detailed valet plan.An earlier plan called for a 23-story hotel at the site, a converted industrial dairy facility. It’s been revised, and construction could start in the spring if the city council approves it.As The Real Deal previously reported, there’s a glut of hotel development planned for the Fulton Market District, and it’s unlikely that demand will be as high as the supply.Additionally, a 243-unit apartment building, developed by Marquette Companies has also been approved by the Plan Commission. The developer plans to renovate and extend an existing five story office space located at 1440 W. Randolph St. This project will help to fulfill obligations under the city’s Affordable Requirements Ordinance passed earlier this year providing nearly 50 affordable units both on and off-site.Ald. Walter Burnett Jr. (27th) has vocally opposed the project.“I have a problem with this one because it’s across from the park,” he said during a meeting. “People that go into the building are going to be complaining to me.

The buyer of both properties was a joint venture of Westport Properties U.S. Storage Centers, which are both based in Irvine, California.“We buy non-institutional property, work with it, turn it around and make it pretty and sell to the institutional guys,” Turik said. “The last three years, especially during the pandemic, the demand skyrocketed.”The Old Town self-storage facility at 1516 North Orleans Street in Chicago was the pricier of the two sold, for about $20 million, according to Turik. The Wilmette property at 3150 Wilmette Avenue sold for about $12 million. The buyers didn’t return a request for comment.While the health crisis and its impacts boosted the “four D’s” that drive the self-storage market — death, divorce, displacement and downsizing — it’s now inflation that’s extending the runway for its growth in demand. The more flexible lease terms typical of the self-storage business, that allow for monthly adjustments to rental rates, make the properties a strong hedge against inflation.“As opposed to industrial, we’re not in multi-year leases for rents with one or two tenants. We have hundreds or sometimes thousands of tenants, as month-to-month renters,” Turik said.When he got started in the self-storage market about 15 years ago, Turik was buying such real estate at a 9 percent cap rate, a measure of a property’s rental income after expenses divided its purchase price. Since then, they’ve compressed to about 4 percent, a reflection of the sector’s rising values and decreasing risk as demand swelled.“In two or three years, we’ve experienced demand that normally takes five or 10,” Turik said.The Chicago area also ranks among the top ten markets for its pipeline of new planned storage developments. It’s set to receive 2.6 million square feet in the coming years, according to a report from earlier this year. The area has the largest share of storage space planned in urban markets among the sector’s top cities, with 91 percent of the developing space eschewing the suburbs.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1516 North Orleans Street

Andre Vasquez (40th) are determining which components of the master plan to prioritize, according to Block Club Chicago.To avoid the trends of converting two- and three-flats to single family homes and larger suburban-style developments, the document recommends renovating existing buildings to include affordable rental housing through incentives like historic tax credits and housing tax credits.“The Lincoln Square Master Plan is in line with my own priorities to preserve the picturesque, main-street feel of Lincoln Ave while supporting opportunities for an appropriate level of residential density — which in turn bolsters small businesses and the availability of affordable housing,” Martin said in a statement.The plan’s suggestions for the commercial corridors point to the importance of local business development, encouraging developers to partner with area tenants and coordinating incentives at the city and county levels to attract small businesses.“The Lincoln Square Master Plan does a phenomenal job showing how much potential there is along Lincoln and Lawrence,” Vasquez said in a statement. “A reconstruction of Lawrence Avenue will be planned and installed over the next couple years, so it’s vital to push for our vision for the commercial corridor now.”Infrastructure improvements, the document said, should focus on ways in which to make the neighborhood safer for pedestrians and cyclists, like pedestrian median islands, raised crosswalks, contraflow bike lanes and bike-friendly speed humps.The master plan will be used to help decide how to spend funds collected through a Special Service Area tax over the next five to 10 years.

The reality is a bit more complicated: Trump Tower is an anomaly.The 14,260-square-foot full-floor, five-bedroom 89th-floor condo sold March 7, about six months after Sanjay Shay, CEO of Hoffman Estates-based software maker Vistex, listed the unit for $30 million. Still, the $20 million sale was the second-priciest ever in Chicago, after the 2017 purchase by Citadel Chief Executive Officer Ken Griffin of four condos for more than $58 million in the building at 9 West Walton Street on the Gold Coast in 2017.The deal was taken as a sign by some that the city’s 2021 luxury condo boom – driven by a stock rally and the desire for more space in the work-from-home pandemic era – would continue and even accelerate. Then came inflation concerns, the prospect of higher rates, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and sanctions, and a much more volatile stock market.“I did get some buyers saying a decent amount of money they had went down because of what happened in the stock market,” said Giancarlo Chavez, an agent for Keller Williams ONE Chicago, who closed an $8.42 million deal for a four-bedroom 75th-floor condo at the St. Regis Chicago last year. “If the stocks keep going down, they [buyers] may look at their equity and reconsider their purchase.”Five condos in the city of Chicago priced at $4 million and more changed hands as of March 9, compared with just two during the same period last year, according to the Multiple Listing Service. In all of 2021, 42 condos sold for more than $4 million, with an $11.25 million sale of an 8,800-square-foot 26th-floor penthouse unit at 840 North Lake Shore Drive setting the highest-priced condo sale last year.“I think we’ll see also a lot of turnarounds in new buildings,’’ said Coldwell Banker’s Chezi Rafaeli, the broker on the Trump Tower penthouse, who sold 10 units priced between $4 million and $20 million in 2021. “People are trying to update to newer, larger units, newer buildings.”For now, potential buyers are watching the economic fallout from the war. On March 7, the S&P 500 fell about 3 percent, its most dramatic daily decline since October 2020 as investors feared higher energy prices would slow the economy and spark higher inflation, leading the Federal Reserve to raise benchmark interest rates.All of those factors apply to Trump Tower, with one addition: The name.Built in 2009, the property includes retail, parking, a 339-room hotel, and condos. The building has a 20.6-foot tall “TRUMP” sign overlooking the Chicago River.The Trump brand, once considered by some a marker of high-end products and real estate, has been irrevocably tied with his divisive presidency. That brand is further complicated in Chicago, an overwhelmingly Democratic city that Trump regularly denounced as president.“Obviously the building was impacted by the presidency,” said Gail Lissner, managing director at Integra Realty Resources. “It became a little bit more of a building where people definitely liked it or had some issue with the name. It probably had a smaller pool of potential buyers due to the controversy around him.”Lissner said the property has tremendous upsides in its location, design, and views. The property was mirroring the market as it rose, then over the last five years, there was a weakening in prices at Trump Tower that was more significant than the rest of the market.Lissner compiled the average sales price of condos within Chicago’s Trump Tower from MRED, the Chicago area’s multiple listing service. In the first and second quarters of 2021, the average sale price per square foot was $579. That jumped to $662 in the third and fourth quarters.“It was more heavily impacted than other buildings, but condo prices, in general, have not been real robust in the Chicago Downtown market.”The buyer of the $20 million condo wasn’t disclosed, so it remains unknown whether there was a political motivation to the purchase.After the Trump Tower condo sale, the 7,500-square-foot full-floor penthouse unit on the 65th floor at One Bennett Park in Streeterville is now the highest-priced condo on the market at just over $15 million.A 47-story condo tower, known as Cirrus Condominiums, in Lakeshore East is expected to deliver 350 units with prices ranging from $400,000 to $5 million in the first quarter. Luxury condo developments are set to expand to Fulton Market from the Streeterville and Lakeshore East neighborhoods, where One Bennett Park and St. Regis are located. Dubbed Momad, four units for the 10-story, 25-unit condo at 1010 West Madison Street, already went under contract at just under $6 million in November, even before breaking ground.Contact Connie Kim\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Miranda Davis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",30 million.

Brookfield will also assume Watermark’s debt.Watermark, founded in 2008 and based in the West Loop, has more than 8,100 rooms across 25 properties in 14 states.“Hotels and resorts of this scale and quality are difficult to replicate,” Brookfield’s Lowell Baron, said in the statement. “This portfolio is well positioned given its concentration in high barrier to entry coastal destinations, gateway cities and the sunbelt.”Brookfield made waves in Chicago in April, when it walked away from its ownership in Water Tower Mall, an established shopping center on the city’s most famous shopping district, the Magnificent Mile.Brookfield relinquished the mall to its lender, MetLife Investment Management, a unit of New York insurer MetLife. Water Tower Place was the first indoor mall in Chicago when it opened in 1975 and is part of a development that included condominiums, office space and the Ritz-Carlton Chicago.The decision underscored how challenging it’s been for landlords and retail tenants on the Chicago shopping strip to recover even as the pandemic wanes.

Crossing into both is the former Michael Reese Hospital complex the city bought 11 years ago. The 49-acre site would have been the Olympic Village in Chicago’s failed bid for the 2016 Summer Games, and more recently, Amazon’s second headquarters in that unsuccessful offering.Just before the Opportunity Zones selection process got underway last year, Chicago officials chose a team of private developers to embark on a $2 billion megaproject on the Michael Reese site. The pending project was already in line to collect city funds for the construction of a new technology campus, but would now stand to gain significant federal tax incentives with the Opportunity Zone designation.But when city officials drew up an initial list of proposed Opportunity Zones, it did not include the Reese site. The sprawling property did not meet the city’s original guidelines for neighborhoods in need of more investment. Despite that, state officials intervened in spring 2018 to personally add those two tracts, according to interviews with those involved and emails obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.That action highlights a nagging criticism leveled against the Opportunity Zones program. Skeptics contend the initiative, meant to lift up distressed neighborhoods, may instead serve to enhance gains on projects that developers already intended to build.The 100-acre assemblage of public land that includes the Reese site is now split between two designated Opportunity Zones. That will likely help developers raise the $735 million in equity investments they outlined two years ago as part of their plan for the site, to be renamed the “Burnham Lakefront.” The potential is so great that the Reese site tracts could become the most lucrative of all the Opportunity Zones in the state.The city’s chosen developers for the project include Farpoint Development. Led by Scott Goodman, Farpoint has teamed up with Clayco on the newly-formed Decennial Group Opportunity Fund — unveiled in early April — making the Reese site its centerpiece.Goodman “did not have any conversations with any state or city officials concerning [Opportunity Zone] tract designation until well after the zones were designated,” he wrote in an email.Criteria for selectionMost of Chicago’s Opportunity Zone tracts were chosen because they fall under a set of criteria used by the city as a benchmark for struggling neighborhoods: a combination of at least 20 percent unemployment, a 30 percent-plus poverty rate and median family incomes below $38,000.Of the 135 tracts chosen in Chicago, 27 fail to meet at least one of these standards. Eight zones, including the northern Michael Reese tract, meet none of them. That tract’s median income is more than $83,000, Census data shows.The inclusion of the Reese site stood out in part because of how closely city and state officials had otherwise stuck to the Opportunity Zone’s original mission of lifting up high-poverty neighborhoods, said Geoff Smith, director of the DePaul University Institute for Housing Studies.In a report published earlier this year, the institute called attention to three of the 135 zones where property values had already been relatively high and rising rapidly before they were selected as Opportunity Zones. The northern Michael Reese census tract was one of them. The other two were on the Near West Side and in the Illinois Medical District.“From what we found, the city basically did a good job of identifying tracts that were under-invested,” Smith said. “But there were a few exceptions that we flagged with rising prices and growing demand for housing, that could be potentially vulnerable to displacement.”Created as part of the 2017 federal tax overhaul, Opportunity Zones open a range of tax incentives for developers and investors who can substantially raise the value of land in certain distressed areas and hold on to the properties for 10 years. In spring 2018, state governors were allowed to nominate tracts.In Illinois, it fell to then-Gov. Bruce Rauner to decide which of the state’s 1,305 eligible Census tracts to designate as Opportunity Zones. On April 20, 2018, he submitted 327 tracts to the U.S. Treasury Department, with 135 in Chicago — including the two Reese tracts.Chicago’s choices, mostly on the city’s South and West Sides, had been drafted by a trio of top city officials including Aarti Kotak, Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s chief of staff for neighborhood economic development. In an interview, Kotak said she compiled the list alongside city planning department Commissioner David Reifman and then-Deputy Mayor Robert Rivkin.Email sent, change madeKotak, Reifman and Rivkin acted on guidance from Emanuel to “make sure those communities most in need got the most benefit,” Kotak said.She added that Chicago leaders sought to avoid the maps drawn for cities like San Francisco and New York, where part of Amazon’s now-abandoned Queens campus plan had been designated an Opportunity Zone.The three officials drew their map based on the benchmark criteria for poverty, unemployment and average income. They then discarded 15 proposed zones after consulting with various aldermen who suggested other tracts where “we know there is momentum for development,” Kotak said.On March 9, 2018, Kotak sent an email to senior Rauner administration officials Sean McCarthy and Lanae Clarke, with an attached list of 133 tracts. They did not include the two tracts comprising the Michael Reese site.About 40 minutes later, records show, Kotak sent another email to McCarthy and Clarke — CC’ing Rivkin and Reifman — saying she had added the two Michael Reese tracts to the list “per my conversation with Sean.”After state officials switched out about a dozen more tracts, the Reese tracts and 133 others were ultimately certified as Opportunity Zones.Kotak denied any undue influence was exerted on the selection process. The two Reese zones were chosen because they are “challenged tracts,” she said, that city and state leaders all understood would be added to the Opportunity Zone site list. Though relatively wealthy and close to Downtown, the east edge of the tracts is “isolated” and bisected by Metra rail tacks, making them especially hard to build around, she said.“The Michael Reese tracts are a priority for the city and the state,” Kotak added. She cited their proximity to McCormick Place and the “need to better compete for convention business, given the gateway it provides to the broader South Side, and the need to pull up that part of the city.”The Reese site was among several tracts where the city appeared to prioritize accelerating existing proposals over jump-starting new ones.“The city was trying to be strategic in attracting investment” in the Reese site and other high-value parts of the city, Smith said. The combination of Opportunity Zones and current market forces could “drive up values of areas where investments are already happening.”Alderman Sophia KingCity officials never consulted Alderman Sophia King, whose 4th Ward includes the entire Michael Reese site, about the Opportunity Zone designation, according to King chief of staff Prentice Butler. But Kotak contends the mayor’s office met with the alderman about the zones.Butler said the alderman still “wants to better understand what happened in terms of the selection process and the conversations that may or may not have happened to get there.”Developers at the tableThe city has owned the massive lakefront site containing the Reese campus since 2008, when it bought the land for $86 million. In 2016, the city’s planning department issued a request for proposals for a private entity to redevelop it.Eight months later, officials chose a proposal for a “commercial research and innovation district” from a venture including Farpoint, McLaurin Development and Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives.The group is still negotiating a sale agreement with city officials, but the application they submitted in early 2017 included a $144.5 million offer to buy the entire property in phases.Kotak said she did not personally consult members of the development team during the Opportunity Zone tract selection process in early 2018. She also downplayed the likelihood of the “innovation district” proposal becoming reality, saying that the “selection of a team doesn’t mean anything as far as the development getting done.”Even with the selection of a developer, she said, “that site is still going to require environmental and infrastructure work in the tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars. So if Opportunity Zones help accelerate investment in a site that’s been dead for a decade, we were happy to include that as a tool.”Clarke and Reifman both declined to comment on the decision. McCarthy, now a regional executive with Comcast, did not respond to requests for comment.“In the mix”On March 12, 2018, three days after Kotak sent the city’s amended list of recommended Opportunity Zone sites, Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives president David Doig emailed McCarthy and Clarke. Provided was a list of six Census tracts he asked to be designated as Opportunity Zones, including three surrounding the Reese site.“There was a very short timeline from when the legislation was approved to when the governor had to designate them, so we just wanted to make sure we were in the mix,” said Doig, who was superintendent of the Chicago Park District from 1999 to 2004. The Reese sites made sense as Opportunity Zones, he added, because they include vacant land the city has “wanted to see developed for a long time.”In February 2017, when the Farpoint-led coalition submitted its proposal to redevelop the Michael Reese site, the Opportunity Zones program was not on its radar. But its application did outline a patchwork of tax credits and other public financing levers it would seek to help jump-start the proposal. Those included tax increment financing, environmental cleanup grants, New Market Tax Credits and city and state transportation grants.When the Opportunity Zones program rolled out, things changed. Without the benefits investors can enjoy from Opportunity Zones, “a platform like Decennial Group wouldn’t exist,” the venture said this month when the Treasury Department released its latest regulations regarding the program. And it added, the venture “wouldn’t have a pipeline of deals under consideration throughout America’s Heartland.”This story was updated to clarify the guidelines used by the city as a benchmark for selecting Opportunity Zones.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

10:00 AM","The City Council’s recent move to update Chicago’s building code for the first time in 70 years could be a boon for the real estate industry, which long has pushed for changes to make development cheaper and easier.","[""Buildings Department Commissioner Judy Frydland (Credit: iStock; illustration by Kevin Rebong for The Real Deal)The City Council’s recent move to update Chicago’s building code for the first time in 70 years could be a boon for the real estate industry, which long has pushed for changes to make development cheaper and easier.The new code adopts a lot of the standards in the 2018 International Building Code, which architects and designers are billing as a huge win for the industry. For one, architects will have to spend less time becoming acquainted with Chicago’s byzantine code.“It will help standardize how architects complete projects, so Chicago is not as peculiar as it used to be,” said Zurich Esposito, executive vice president of the American Institute of Architects’ Chicago branch.Some of the big changes in the new building codes include requiring sprinkler systems in residential buildings with four or more units, reducing the minimum ceiling requirements in basement and attic spaces to boost ancillary dwelling units, and requiring seismic design features for the first time in the city’s history.Development, particularly of high-rise multifamily and office buildings, still flourished under the previous code. But that doesn’t mean the process wasn’t onerous.Modern building techniques and materials have been allowed in Chicago’s new developments, but using them often required a special approval, which ate up time and resources for the city and developers, city Buildings Department Commissioner Judy Frydland said.“It gives our code a flexibility,” said Frydland, who spearheaded the overhaul.For example, glass as a structural element in buildings was permissable only if the builder secured a special permit, since the previous rules did not specifically allow it. Now developers wanting to use glass in such a way won’t need to seek special permission, said Chris Chwedyk, a licensed architect who also works as a building code consultant.The same goes for new materials used in roof repairs and the use of plastics in certain home projects, he said.The new code will also allow for the use of the “performative method,” which allows for greater flexibility in rehab projects, said Ken DeMuth, partner at Pappageorge Haymes Partners who was co-chairman of the committee charged with reviewing the city’s renovation codes. Previously, rehabbers and developers followed the “prescriptive” method, which required them to stick to the letter of the building code.“It gives you more approaches to use,” DeMuth said. “Especially in rehabs, not everything fits in a nice, neat box.”While the changes will impact high-rise construction, the new code will particularly be a boon to single-family and small-scale development, said Paul Colgan, government affairs director for the Home Builders Association of Greater Chicago.“We’re building a lot of multifamily but not a lot of single-family or two flats,” Colgan said. “These could help construct some of the housing types that are needed in the neighborhood.”Streamlining the permitting process and allowing for new construction methods and materials could make housing development cheaper, therefore reducing housing prices for residents, said Brian Bernardoni, local government affairs director for the Illinois Association of Realtors.“We won’t have an affordable city until we have an affordable building code,” he said. “We’re making strides in that direction.”In overhauling the code, Frydland said an emphasis was placed on making home improvements and historical rehabs easier and more affordable. A pilot program that allowed the use of new techniques and materials in plumbing worked saved Chicago homeowners and landlords $15 million, Frydand said.Real estate advocates did not get everything they wanted in the overhaul. The industry lobbied for allowing more extensive use of plastic piping in some housing development, but it did not make the final cut.And requiring sprinkler systems in new residential construction of four or more units will increase costs for developers. Coglan said he’d have liked to have seen a higher threshold for sprinklers, but that “staying away from single family, two- and three-flats is crucial.” To help with the cost of sprinklers, the city will now allow developers greater height and density in some buildings, according to the city.The city will gradually phase in the new code, to allow for the working out of any kinks that should arise, Frydland said.The new building code book will be published in October, at which point the city will have an invitation-only pilot program that will allow developers to use the new rules. Frydland said developments of all sizes will hopefully participate in the pilot to determine how the new codes impact building projects.The new regulations will become mandatory by August 2020.“There’s still a lot of work to be done,” Frydland said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Both properties were purchased through a joint venture with Texas-based commercial real estate investment company Encore Enterprises, according to AmCap.AmCap also owns the Amazon Fresh-anchored Norridge Commons in Norridge, the Aldi-anchored Mallard Crossing in Elk Grove and the Jewel-Osco anchored NorthPoint Center in Arlington Heights.The pandemic upped the value of assets referred to as daily needs retail. Investors have dropped more than $250 million into such businesses in the Chicago-area over the past several months. Trades of grocery-anchored assets hit a record high in 2021, according to JLL.In August, Tampa’s East Coast Acquisitions picked up Thatcher Woods Center in River Grove from Northbrook retail real estate investment firm Pine Tree for $30.5 million, and Allied Development paid PGIM $30.2 million for the Marshfield Plaza shopping strip in the South Side’s Morgan Park neighborhood, demonstrating interest in properties within the city as well as in the suburbs. In June, California’s Realty Income acquired a 66,000-square-foot South Loop property leased by the grocery Mariano’s for $52.4 million.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

12:00 PM",Even lifelong Chicagoans could be forgiven for thinking they’ve crossed into small-town Indiana when they take Ewing Avenue past 100th Street.,"[""Clockwise from top left: Bungalows in East Side, a “pocket park” fountain in East Side, a vacant storefront in Hegewisch, Hegewisch Marsh ParkEven lifelong Chicagoans could be forgiven for thinking they’ve crossed into small-town Indiana when they take Ewing Avenue past 100th Street.But in some ways, the lunch-bucket communities of East Side and Hegewisch are as Chicago as you can get: small shops and gilded-era workers cottages, built for organized steelworkers and maintained by off-duty cops and firefighters.The area bears an architectural resemblance to other outskirt neighborhoods like Dunning and Mount Greenwood, with corrugated metal houses mixed among brick bungalows and American foursquares.But unlike those neighborhoods, the Southeast Side boasts hundreds of acres of undeveloped land, with plenty of protected natural scenery to boot. East Side abuts the lakefront with the 200-acre Calumet Park, and Hegewisch is surrounded by huge swathes of marshland preserved by city, state and county agencies.The industrial-era enclave has been on a slow decline since the offshoring days of the 1970s and ‘80s, and the enduring vacancy of the nearby 440-acre South Works site remains an ominous sign for investors. But now that warehouse developers in the region can’t seem to staunch their hunger for more space, the Southeast Side could be in perfect position for a rebound.In the beginningIn 1883, steel magnate Adolph Hegewisch picked a remote stretch on the east bank of the Calumet River to build a company town, vowing to build a canal that would connect the nearby Wolf Lake to Lake Michigan.The canal never materialized, but Republic Steel and other manufacturers followed Hegewisch and opened factories along the river in the 1900s and 1910s, juicing home construction for the Eastern European immigrant workers who poured their metal. About two miles up the river from Hegewisch, steelworkers formed another bedroom community they called East Side.As the metals industry expanded in the 1920s and ‘30s, the Southeast Side became a hotbed for union organizing, eventually giving rise to the powerful political submachine that produced City Council titan Ed Vrdoylak. Sue Sadlowski-Garza, daughter of United Steelworkers of America leader Ed Sadlowski, was elected alderman of the far-reaching 10th Ward in 2015.The area’s economic fortunes turned with the American steel industry’s decline in the 1970s, and both Hegewisch and East Side began to bleed population. Republic Steel wound down its production through the 1980s, and U.S. Steel shut down South Works in 1992.But the neighborhoods stayed afloat in part thanks to Ford’s 2.8 million-square-foot auto plant, which has been pumping out cars at 126th Street and Torrence Avenue since 1924.Signs of changeIn 2016, city leaders chose Chinese manufacturer CRRC Sifang America to build a 380,000-square-foot CTA train car factory in Hegewisch. The company paid $87 million this spring to buy the 45-acre property at 13535 South Torrence Avenue, just south of the Ford Plant, from Centerpoint Properties.And this summer, the Missouri-based Northpoint Development announced plans to build a nearly 200-acre campus of spec distribution warehouses along the west side of Avenue O, the main connector between East Side and Hegewisch. City leaders agreed to kick $25.3 million from the Lake Calumet tax increment financing district into the $169 million project.TransportationEast Side is bisected by the Chicago Skyway and Hegewisch offers quick access to the Bishop Ford Expressway, both of which can get drivers to the Loop in 25 minutes on a light traffic day.The Metra Electric Line only runs west of the Calumet River, but the Indiana-based South Shore Line branches out from the Metra tracks around 130th Street and stops in Hegewisch on its way to South Bend.Both Hegewisch and East Side are served by the CTA No. 30 bus, which trails down Ewing Avenue and Avenue O. The part-time CTA No. 100 bus shuttles passengers between East Side and the 95th/Dan Ryan Red Line station via 106th Street.Residential Take“It’s a working-class neighborhood, and a lot of city workers live there because they can get a great affordable house with good schools and lakefront access,” said Louis Silva, an @properties broker who sells homes primarily on the Southeast Side. “You can get a rehabbed single-family home for under $200,000, although that number is now starting to push up. The average price for a fixed-up four-bedroom is around $185,000, which is a little over 2006 levels. We’ve traditionally lost out on a lot of retail and commercial because we’re so close to the Indiana border, but with all this new industrial, those employees are going to want to eat and go out. So hopefully some of those neighborhood bars are going to reopen.”Commercial Take“It’s a very industrial-driven part of the city, and when you get that far east it gets a little dead in terms of multifamily” buildings, said Aaron Sklar of commercial brokerage Kiser Group. “But with so many big speculations going on, I think a lot of people are betting on new multifamily and single-family from the jobs that would inevitably come from that. A lot of that doesn’t exist yet, but I expect to see a huge uptick in both residential and commercial prices in the next few years.“The East Side is similar to the rest of the South Side in that investors are looking for cash-on-cash returns, and you have a handful of out-of-town developers coming in because of these [capitalization] rates that are just unheard of in most of the country.”Demographics (ZIP Code 60633)2016 population: 12,817 (down 1 percent since 2010)Median age: 39.1Median family income: $61,250Median non-family income: $29,179Average residential sale price within the last 12 months$125,000 — $104 per square footAverage current residential listing price$141,411 — $122 per square footPriciest residential sale3853 East 110th Street — $335,000Most expensive home on the market11524 South Avenue G — $289,000Least expensive home on the market10326 South Avenue H — $39,900Price trends (Redfin)The median family home price in Hegewisch hit $153,000 in July, a 28 percent spike over July 2018.

That sale was subject to an unspecified contingency and has since fallen through.The home was then re-listed in December for $9.5 million, and came under contract earlier this month. The listing price doesn’t necessarily indicate what the buyers will pay, which won’t be available in public records until the sale closes.Michael LaFido, of eXp Realty, is the agent for the sellers. He wouldn’t comment on the sale price or the deal beyond confirming the house has a new buyer.Sellers Sam and Geralyn Cecola, owners of the Admiral Theater strip club on Chicago’s North Side, built the home in 2008 and initially listed it for $15.9 million in 2013. Successive price cuts had shaved the asking price down to $9.5 million by 2019 and $7.5 million in May 2020.Starting in 2014, the estate was featured as the home of lead actor Terrance Howard’s character Lucious Lyon on “Empire,” which concluded with its sixth season in 2020. Located between Keene and Heather Lakes, the home has six bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, a large outdoor pool, boat slip and garage parking for nine cars, according to the listing.The home is an anomaly in the Barrington Hills market, which is about 40 miles northwest of Chicago. Should the deal close, it would be the only sale of more than $5 million in the suburb in recent years. The suburban luxury market continues to outperform over sectors in Chicago. Mansions in Kenilworth and Winnetka are at the top of the market, seeking $14 million and $16 million, respectively.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",5 million in May 2020.St

It was built in 1962 and was 10 stories; two floors were added in 1991.The 13th-floor addition will include a 25-seat rotunda board room with views of the skyline, One Development president John Gagliardo told Crain’s. New offices will provide more work space for tenants in the future and allow current tenants to have temporary offices while One Development renovates floor by floor from the top of the building down.Work on the new top floor is expected to start in the fall and be completed in a year, with floor-by-floor renovations to follow.The NAR headquarters sits on a stretch of Michigan Avenue set to see a flurry of activity in the coming years as Golub & Company and CIM Group plan a massive overhaul of the former Tribune Tower complex, which would include construction of Chicago’s second-tallest building.Next door, billionaire Joe Mansueto recently closed on a $255 million deal to buy the iconic Wrigley Bulding.In May, the association raised annual dues 25 percent, from $120 to $150, to go with the extra annual fee of $35 for NAR’s advertising campaign.NAR hadn’t raised dues since 2012, when members were asked to pay an additional $40.

Its founder Jeff Pelock said the business has built up and down the western Chicagoland area over the last 35 years.The commission recommended the plan to the Elgin City Council unanimously, with one commissioner citing historically low housing inventory levels.“Let’s get building,” Commissioner Nancy Abuali said.The townhouses will be arranged across 23 buildings, with each two- or three-story building containing three to seven units. It’s set to be located at the intersection of Randall and Hopps roads.To the south, Milwaukee’s Fiduciary Real Estate Development has applied for zoning approval to develop a mostly-vacant 32-acre property at the southwest corner of South Randall and Hopps roads into 280 residential rental units across 14 two-story buildings.That development, dubbed Seasons at Elgin, would include 28 studio units, 112 one-bedroom units, 112 two-bedroom units and 28 three-bedroom units.Demand for homes in the Windy City’s suburbs has been on the rise. Approximately 13,600 residential units were absorbed in 2021, even though just 4,250 rentals were completed, according to Marcus & Millichap’s latest Chicago Multifamily Market Report.The two best-performing suburban areas — those that saw the biggest drops in vacancy rates and rises in rent — were Schaumburg and Arlington Heights-Palatine, according to the report. Some brokers said the pandemic has made suburbs more attractive places to live as remote work models crimp the need for downtown offices and workers seek more room in suburban settings. The suburbs also have more land available for construction.Another Chicago suburb is also getting an influx of residential units, as the Skokie Village Board approved a 500-unit apartment project this week.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The plan was to annex the 138 acres into the nearby village of Itasca.“Transwestern Development Company has made the decision that, primarily due to changing market conditions, our pursuit of a potential redevelopment of Medinah Terrace is not economically feasible,” Transwestern Vice President Ted Staszak and Regional Partner Darcie Fankhauser wrote in the letter. “We will no longer pursue purchasing any of the homes in our Phase One area or any other homes in the Medinah Terrace location.”As an unincorporated community, Medinah doesn’t have any municipal leaders, therefore residents often govern themselves in situations like this. This summer, when some of the Medinah residents received letters from Transwestern offering to buy out their properties, opponents organized and responded with their own signed letter saying they would reject any solicitations from the developer.Transwestern’s decision to avoid trying to overcome the opposition helps illustrate the ceiling on costs and obstacles developers are willing to endure to obtain increasingly scarce land for industrial construction as rental rates for warehousing have skyrocketed amid record demand and all-time-low vacancies in the Chicago industrial market during the pandemic.Dodging the headache of dealing with the Medinah opponents stands in contrast to Nevada-based Dermody Properties completing its $232 million purchase of the 232-acre former Allstate office campus in suburban Glenview. A fight between neighboring suburbs over which village the property would be annexed into broke out over the summer, but it was resolved and Dermody still closed with its plan to redevelop it as a massive, 10-building warehouse campus.Medinah residents aren’t convinced Itasca will subdue future pitches to developers who could annex the land into the village as part of a new development.“The fact that we got Transwestern to pull out, Itasca has to understand that if they come after us with another developer, whether it’s developer A, B or C, we’re going to fight them again, and we’re going to fight back even harder,” Medinah resident Susie vander Nat told the outlet.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

In March 2018, the firm hired Eastdil Secured to market the store and the 10,000 square feet of retail inside the tower.It’s unclear whether Walton Street is still trying to sell the other retail space, according to Crain’s, which said the roughly $3,900 per square foot Invesco paid for the property is the fifth-highest price paid for a Chicago retail property.The store reportedly pays roughly $125 per square foot in rent, which the Wall Street Journal cited is well below the typical $400 or $500 per square foot charged on the Magnificent Mile. The storied retail strip is dealing with a number of vacancies, including the Apple Store’s former home a few blocks north. The Mag Mile vacancy rate last year was up 4 percent over 2015.

He was represented by Rachel Vecchio of Dream Town Realty.Larrea, who has an estimated net worth of $21.2 billion according to Forbes, paid $3.57 million through a limited liability company to buy a 38th-floor condo in the Ritz-Carlton Residences building in 2014. Two years later, Larrea paid $11.7 million through a different limited liability company to buy the full-floor condo on the 52nd floor of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel’s residential portion. Larrea used this same limited liability company to buy the St. Regis unit.Last week, the buyers of a condo in Trump Tower were identified. Private equity veteran Bryan Cressey and his wife, plastic surgeon Iliana Sweis, spent $20 million on the 14,260-square-foot unit sold at 401 North Wabash Avenue.The $20.56 million purchase, which was $2 million over the $18.5 million asking price, was beat out by two package deals. Billionaire Ken Griffin, who recently left Chicago for Miami, spent $58.75 million for four condo units at 9 West Walton Street in four separate transactions in 2017.

The massive complex was expected to trade for over $200 million — roughly $189,000 a unit — according to the report.Multi-Employer Property Trust Fund owns the two-tower development at 333 East Ontario Street. Toronto-based BentallGreenOak oversees the buildings and is an adviser. MEPT paid $126 million for McClurg Court in 2006. The report noted that BentallGreenOak has poured $35 million into improvements at the nearly 50-year-old complex.The decision to sell comes at a time when the Chicago apartment market has taken a big hit, in contrast to the suburbs, where demand remained strong. The third-quarter occupancy rate for Downtown rentals dipped to 87.1 percent from 93.8 percent in the third quarter of 2019. The latest number was the lowest figure in two decades, and has forced landlords to cut rents more than 20 percent year-over-year and offer more concessions.Because MEPT owns the complex but not the dirt underneath, BentallGreenOak negotiated a longer ground lease on McClurg Court in 2019 — to 99 years from 45 years — after the complex failed to sell.

The properties are part of Combs’ $185 million purchase of nine retail stores and three production properties from the Cresco-Columbia Care marijuana business merger.Combs will run the largest Black-owned cannabis company in the country when and if regulators approve the purchase.“My mission has always been to create opportunities for Black entrepreneurs in industries where we’ve traditionally been denied access, and this acquisition provides the immediate scale and impact needed to create a more equitable future in cannabis,” Combs said in a news release.A prominent rapper and record producer, Combs is set to pay $110 million in cash and $45 million in financing through seller notes. His purchase is on track to be approved around the same time as the merger, which is expected to be decided by the first quarter of 2023.Cresco owns 10 retail dispensaries in Illinois, which is the maximum allowed by state law. Because of this, Columbia Care’s dispensaries, which were recently rebranded “Cannabist,” had to be sold off as a divestment, giving a path to Combs to step in.Since recreational cannabis use was legalized in Illinois in January 2020, landlords of dispensaries have been earning more green. In July, local investor Centrum completed a deal that more than tripled the value of a River North building at 60 West Superior Street occupied by a dispensary branded by Verilife.Cannabis researcher Headset said U.S. cannabis sales are expected to pass $30 billion this year and reach $45.8 billion by 2025.

A local outlet, the Daily Herald, reported that United will use space at the former Motorola campus at 1501 West Shure Drive. About 900 employees including managers and technical support staff are expected to move from Willis, formerly known as the Sears Tower.The shift doesn’t mean United is abandoning Chicago. About 2,500 headquarters staff will stay at Willis Tower, where the airline is investing millions to renovate amenities.“In terms of whether United is considering moving its headquarters out of downtown, the answer is no,” spokesman Charles Hobart told the outlets. “We remain committed to the city of Chicago.”As remote work upends the traditional office model, landlords are fretting about rising vacancy rates in central business districts. About 22.4 percent of Chicago office space was available in the third quarter, compared with 18.6 percent at the same time last year.The biggest downtown office default came at the 915,000-square-foot Civic Opera House at 20 North Wacker Drive, where New York investment firm 601W was hit with a $195 million foreclosure suit after failing to make monthly loan payments since May.Boeing’s nearby headquarters at 100 North Riverside Plaza are virtually empty as many executives and employees work from home.Moving operations closer to United’s main hub at the O’Hare International Airport “offers crucial advantages, particularly the ability to support the anticipated growth of our airline, given the facility’s larger size and potential for expansion,” said David Kensick, United’s managing director.[Bloomberg]\xa0[Daily Herald] – Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1501 W.

The new headquarters will serve as a model for the firm’s future offices, the firm said.The building is designed as a clubhouse that resembles the nearby boutique hotels rather than the typical corporate environment of the Loop. Cresa plans to spend 50 percent more per square foot for it than it did for its previous offices.“Who wants to go to a sterile central business district?” said Tod Lickerman, CEO of Cresa. “This is an office that will be a magnet which people want to use and where they can work together with their colleagues.”While Cresa plans to expand the number of employees three-fold to about 150 over the next couple of years, its floor plate is one-third the space that it originally thought it needed, taking into account a hybrid work schedule. That’s a choice faced by many downtown firms when leases expire because most employees prefer to work remotely at least some days a week.Fulton Market tenants are paying more to occupy office space at new buildings equipped with lounges, rooftops, gyms, and private meeting rooms.It’s the only part of town where availability dropped last year and demand pushed up the average sale price per square foot to $678 in 2021, compared with the central business district’s $431.Other firms that have leased in Fulton Market include local restaurant operator Gibsons Restaurant Group, which plans to lease 15,000 square feet at a yet-to-be constructed property at 917 West Fulton, developed by developer Fulton Street Companies. Proptech firm VTS signed a deal to lease 36,000 square feet at 320 North Sangamon Street, relocating from the 2,600-square-foot office at 312 North May Street.Cresa has about 80 offices in the U.S., Europe and Asia.

James McNerney retired from the aerospace giant as chairman in 2016, and had been CEO for a decade. The French country-style home has five bedrooms and eight bathrooms. It was built in 1930 and sits about a block away from the shores of Lake Michigan. The 2.25-acre property includes a guest house, lap pool and a wine cellar.The McNerney’s decision to sell at the reduced price reflects the Chicago luxury market’s overall struggles. Home sales fell sharply last year and that slide continued in the first month of 2020.But that hasn’t stopped some homeowners from listing their luxury properties far above what they sold them for. In Hinsdale, a couple recently put their 12,000-square-foot Hillcrest Avenue mansion on the market for just under $6 million. They bought it for $3.3 million in 2014.Also bucking the trend are condo units in JDL Development’s Gold Coast condo tower No. 9 Walton.

03:31 PM","A giant corporate complex in Chicago’s northern suburbs changed hands for $190 million, the priciest sale in the suburbs since well before the pandemic, suggesting demand is rising for an office market suffering from high vacancies.","[""Apollo’s Marc Rowan and Kemper Lakes Business Center (Apollo Global Management, Kemper Lakes Business Center)A giant corporate complex in Chicago’s northern suburbs changed hands for $190 million, the priciest sale in the suburbs since well before the pandemic, suggesting demand is rising for an office market suffering from high vacancies.Northeast Capital Group, based in Spring Valley, New York, bought the Kemper Lake Business Center in suburban Lake County. It’s bordered by one of Illinois’ top golf courses, the Kemper Lakes Golf Club, which hosted the Women’s PGA Championship in 2018 and the PGA Championship in 1989.The nearly 1.1 million-square-foot, four-building property was listed for $185 million in October. Apollo Global Management, which bought the property for $127 million in 2014, was the seller.Northeast declined to comment. Apollo didn’t return a request for comment.The building was 94 percent leased as of October to tenants including office products manufacturer ACCO Brands Corporation. Its second-largest tenant, Dovenmuehle Mortgage, which rented more than 18 percent of the offices, renewed a lease for another 10 years during the pandemic, with a lease expiration date of May 2031, according to a 2020 Morningstar report on a commercial mortgage-backed security loan on the property. The recent deal was financed with a new $90 million loan from Bethpage Federal Credit Union, brokered by Meridian Capital Group.Meanwhile, suburban office vacancies as a whole are weighing on the market. Vacancy has set a new record high in each of the past five quarters, hitting 27.1 percent last quarter, JLL found, though the market’s retreat has started to slow. The northwest and north suburban submarkets, which include Lake Zurich, have been hit the hardest, with the northwest area at 35 percent vacant.Northeast’s purchase illustrates current office demand is increasingly focused on high-quality properties along easy-to-access highways that have been recently renovated or newly built. Brokers said much of the suburban office market’s vacancy rate has been driven upward by properties that aren’t as easy to get to and lack modern amenities.When Apollo bought Kemper Lakes, the property had just undergone extensive renovations.Northeast Capital joins New York-based Opal Holdings with among the biggest bets on suburban Chicago’s office market rebounding. Opal spent $660 million on a trio of buildings that included the Leo Burnett building in downtown Chicago and two suburban properties, and then last month took an undisclosed percent interest in the $73.3 million purchase of a Naperville office building with partner Katherine Caragena, a New York-based investor, to raise its bet.Opal’s nearly $180 million acquisition of the Corporate 500 complex in Deerfield — which is home to Caterpillar’s headquarters — was the priciest suburban office sale in at least five years, until Northeast’s Kemper Lakes purchase, according to Collier’s.The Kemper Lakes sale could be outdone if the All-State campus sale closes this year for $232 million to a developer that plans to turn it into warehouses. That deal, though, is contingent upon getting approval from local governments to redevelop the property into a large warehousing complex, and the two suburbs nearby the property are battling over the rights to annex it.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Robie House near the University of Chicago campus in Hyde Park recently underwent an $11 million restoration project that is drawing praise from preservationists and architecture enthusiasts, according to Curbed.The house includes some of the most well-known features of Wright’s Prairie School style, including horizontal lines and art-adorned windows. Despite its fame, years of neglect — and damage from a student demonstration in the 1960s — caused part of the home to fall into disrepair.The Frank Lloyd Wright Trust decided to restore the home to its original standards, and hired Chicago-based Harboe Architects to lead the project. The firm repaired the home’s brickwork, front door, light fixtures and fireplace.Harboe’s work could give a boost to efforts to win the home a designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, according to Curbed.Wright’s work is undergoing a renaissance of sorts. The nonprofit Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation has launched a “lifestyle brand” including products like stationary and playing cards that include Prairie School designs, Curbed reports.A plan to erect a high-rise residential building near Wright’s Unity Temple in Oak Park has been scuttled, thanks to worries about the project’s impact on the historic place of worship.

Cerebrus fueled the buying spree with $1.6 billion in capital investments, including a $500 million fund it launched earlier this year.Homes owned by Cerebrus also racked up 190 property code violations in Memphis between Jan. 1 and Oct. 31 this year, a higher rate of infractions than any other landlord in most parts of the city, the Post found.Single-family homes have been rapidly scooped up by out-of-town landlords since the foreclosure crisis of 2008, often through “iBuyers” like Opendoor and Offerpad.

The allegations stand in contrast to a 2018 study conducted by CBRE Group Inc. and Maastricht University, which called Chicago the most environmentally friendly U.S. city to work in for two years running.After Emanuel took office in 2012, the city launched the Blue Cart program, which provides for curbside pickup of recycling in single-family homes and smaller multi-unit residential buildings.The 2017 changes required all buildings with five or more units to provide sufficient private recycling services and increased the daily fines for violators to between $500 and $5,000.But they also no longer mandated that property owners certify their buildings have recycling, as many other cities require.A spokesperson for Emanuel said the city’s priority is to work with landlords and not against them, and that the inspections have proven successful at winning compliance.[Block Club] — John O’BrienAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Approval of the development was contingent on Solis’ support.Hynes is a former business partner of Solis’ sister, Patti Solis Doyle, a political consultant and longtime aide to Hillary Clinton.After the allegations against Solis went public this week, the alderman resigned his post as chairman of the City Council’s Zoning Committee, passing along the title to Alderman James Cappleman (46th).Neither Solis nor Hynes has been publicly charged with a crime.

There’s research to back that up. A study of California sales found that green-certified homes sold for between 2.1 percent and 5.3 percent more than similar homes with minimal or no green features. A 2015 study of renovated homes in Washington D.C. concluded the average price premium was around 3.46 percent. A study last year in Texas found that green-certified homes sold for 8 percent more than comparable properties.Home builders have told researchers that two-thirds of their customers say they’re willing to pay higher prices for homes with significant green features, such as energy-efficient appliances, heavy-duty insulation, water conservation, healthy indoor air quality and others.So is that it? Going green always nets you more green — case closed? Not so fast. Two recent studies by appraisers with long experience valuing green homes suggest the answer is more nuanced. Some of the researchers’ findings in brief: Though generally it’s true that green improvements will earn you at least a little higher price, the size of the premium may depend on external factors you hadn’t thought about:— Does the Realtor you picked to list your home know enough about green improvements to market them effectively? Is the agent competent to market what you’ve got to sell?— Does the agent have any formal training in this area, evidenced by a green designation in her or his own listing presentation or advertising?— Does the listing for your home in the local Multiple Listing Service (MLS) contain crucial information about your green improvements, such as a “green addendum” that details the special features that make it energy-efficient?— Does the local MLS have “green fields” that allow listing brokers to fill in the blanks with appropriate detail so that other agents — the ones who are going to find your buyers — know what your house really offers in terms of green improvements?— Do Realtors in the area know much or anything about rating systems such as HERS, LEED, ENERGY STAR or others? Do they know where to turn locally to obtain a rating? (HERS stands for Home Energy Rating System; LEED is a globally recognized rating system for residential and commercial green real estate; ENERGY STAR is a federally developed rating for appliances, building materials, entire houses and commercial property.)If none of these key factors is working for you, your green features may be impressive, but may not earn you much of a premium. Worst case, they might even get you nothing.Sandra Adomatis, a Florida-based real-estate appraiser and nationally known expert on valuing green improvements, headed the research teams for both of the new studies — one focusing on “paired-sale” transactions of homes in the San Francisco Bay area, the other in Virginia and Maryland. A paired-sale analysis examines price differences in transactions, comparing virtually identical homes, one of which has significant green features. In the California study, green-certified houses sold for an average 2.19 percent premium. In some Virginia locations, where the local certification company, Pearl Home Certification, had marketed its services to realty agents, the average price premium was 5 percent. But in areas where Pearl had not yet reached out to Realtors and provided information on how to market certified properties, some premiums dropped to 1 percent or lower.Adomatis, author of the Appraisal Institute’s manual “Residential Green Valuation Tools” and developer of training courses on the subject, told me that in interviews, some agents who listed certified green properties in California admitted they “had no clue what they were selling.” A few even said, “I don’t know what makes a house green.”That’s a direct violation of the code of ethics of the National Association of Realtors, which prohibits members from marketing types of property that are “outside their field of competence” and training. The association offers members in-depth courses on green-home marketing and has urged MLS’s across the country to include “green fields” in their listings.Bottom line: If you want to reap the maximum return from your green improvements, make sure that your Realtor understands what they are and how best to sell them.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

08:30 AM",Discovering a property had air conditioning when a government website said it didn’t was a dealbreaker for one Cook County buyer of delinquent property taxes.,"[""Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas (Cook County Government)Discovering a property had air conditioning when a government website said it didn’t was a dealbreaker for one Cook County buyer of delinquent property taxes.Another backed out of taking over a property through foreclosure after a three-cent mistake — a document the tax buyer filled out himself misstated by less than a nickel how much a property owner needed to pay to get current on taxes and fees.In all cases, a judge agreed to return the tax buyer’s money because of the errors, and take funding out of local government coffers in the process. That included the buyer who made what the Cook County Treasurer’s Office called a “self-inflicted error” for the three-cent problem.The idea behind letting investors buy taxes is to give the county a way to keep a full flow of property tax revenue while allowing homeowners a chance to get caught up on past-due obligations over time. The tax buyers, meanwhile, get a return in the form of interest on the loans, with the right to foreclose and assume control of the property if the owner doesn’t keep up.Tax buyers who break deals based on typos or other small errors on government websites are getting what looks to be a sweeter deal. They offer private financing for tax-indebted residents, getting interest rates that range from 9 percent to zero charged every six months — the rate was lowered from a previous maximum of 18 percent as of earlier this year, under state rules. If and when the bet goes sour — when the resident fails to meet the terms of the loan — the tax buyers can back out of the deal based on some small paperwork error, take a pass on foreclosing on the property, and get their principal back in full from the county, often with the interest.Cook County and its local taxing bodies such as school districts, townships and water reclamation districts — which altogether charged more than $15 billion in property taxes in 2019, including the $781 million the county government itself charged — lose the tax revenue they thought they had maintained with the program. And the property will remain in arrears, another step toward the deterioration of property and its value dotting Chicago’s South Side and working class suburbs on its edge.Treasurer Maria Pappas has put such refunds — and the real estate investors in late tax payments who receive them, plus interest in many cases — under the microscope. A study by her office released Wednesday morning reveals nearly $280 million between 2015 and 2022 has been given back to buyers, including $27.7 million in interest, who wriggle out of deals using methods local officials say aren’t allowed in other states.“They’ve taken advantage of our failures,” said Todd Lighty, a treasurer’s office researcher who authored the study. “They may at times, we believe, target government-owned properties, nonprofit properties that the treasurer’s office wrongly offered the taxes for sale on.”The system benefits institutional tax buyers over taxpayers, the study says, and works against the intent of the annual tax sale held for Cook County properties whose owners are late to pay their bills. The burden is disproportionately borne by local governments serving Chicago neighborhoods and southern suburbs made up of mostly Black and Latino residents, with 87 percent of the refunds analyzed drained out of such communities, the study said. And it’s the result of local judges’ interpretation of state law that officials and experts say is far more friendly to buyers than the rules in other states.While Cook County’s tax sale is mandated to be held annually, it’s meant to give property owners some time to catch up on paying their tax bill if they fall behind. That prevents a lien from getting filed against their assets and losing the real estate in foreclosure. Tax buyers step in and offer local governments the revenue they’re missing, and bid against each other at auction for tax certificates, winning by offering the lowest interest rate, starting at 9 percent all the way down to zero percent, to the underlying owner who has to pay back the taxes.Most owners do eventually catch up, and the tax buyers come away having recouped their investment plus some interest. When investors encounter an owner who never repays, though, they’re given the option to foreclose on the property and seek its deed. In fact, many tax buyers bid zero percent interest if they’re eager to take over ownership of the real estate and reposition it for a profit.But the treasurer’s office has narrowed in on buyers who get cold feet when it’s time to start taking over the property through a foreclosure proceeding, and instead opt to pursue what’s known as a sale-in-error refund through Cook County Circuit Court.No one, it seems, is better at navigating the system and poking holes in it than Greg Bingham, according to the study. Entities Bingham controls or is affiliated with were granted $95 million in refunds from 2015 to 2022 on 2,309 sales in error, including $7.8 million local governments paid in interest to the investor. Attempts to reach Bingham were not successful.Even pieces of government-owned highways are mistakenly put up for grabs at the tax sale, and sometimes cost local governments money, in the form of interest, when the tax buyers claim to discover they were unknowingly sold a strip of road that isn’t subject to property taxes.Bingham and his associates obtained at least 45 sales in error involving stretches of highway that were wrongly offered for sale due to a misclassification in government property data or another mistake since 2014, the most of any investor in Cook County’s delinquent property taxes, getting refunded $4.7 million plus more than $500,000 in interest on such deals.Pappas is pushing state lawmakers to change the decades-old law regarding what constitutes sales-in-error that her office says was influenced by property tax investors and has become too liberally interpreted by local judges in favor of the buyers.It allows investors to capitalize on single-character typos on government website data sets of addresses and other characteristics of properties, legal notices being served late by the sheriff’s office even though tax sale buyers can provide the sheriff little time before a deadline to handle them, and other unintentional errors in descriptions of property.Illinois also lets investors receive refunds, plus interest in some cases, for tax purchases on property whose owner declares bankruptcy after the tax sale, even if the bankruptcy occurs years after the tax purchase. In other states, tax buyers have to wait in line at bankruptcy court with other creditors to get their money back. The study found owners of 888 properties in Cook County who had their taxes sold between 2015 and 2022 subsequently filed for bankruptcy, resulting in nearly $17 million being refunded to tax buyers, including $2.5 million in interest.While it believes some buyers are exploiting the system, the Treasurer’s Office admits plenty of the blame is on its own staff and leadership, as well as other government offices and poor communication across separate divisions of the public sector allowing errors to go uncorrected.“We’re not necessarily saying all sale-in-errors are illegitimate, or someone shouldn’t necessarily get refunded if the county made a material mistake, one that affected their ability to make the profit that was anticipated, or a mistake that made it impossible to make a profit, and perhaps with some reasonable interest rate,” said Hal Dardick, another researcher with the treasurer’s office.It’s a statewide issue, with taxing districts in Winnebago County, home of Rockford, refunding more than $1 million to tax buyers in 2019 due to sales in error, or about $3.50 per resident of the county of about 280,000 people. But it’s most concentrated in Cook County, home to suburban Dixmoor, with a predominantly Black and Latino population that had $3.4 million, or $1,142 per person, drained from local government coffers by sales in error between 2015 and 2022, an average of $163 per resident per year.However, judges have granted the most sales in error for mistakes on the Cook County Assessor’s website, which contains listings for nearly 1.8 million properties including some that contain slight inaccuracies. Many of the overturned tax sale deals have been for trivial errors that would have caused no financial loss to the buyer, the study says.For instance, a Bingham-backed entity sought its money back on a dilapidated home in the southern suburb of Harvey with a back bill on taxes that was worth more than the property’s market value. The assessor’s website said there was no attic, but because the home actually did have an attic, a $93,000 refund was granted, including at least $17,000 in interest, the study said.A shift could be taking place, though. In August 2018, Cook County Court Judge Maureen Hannon took the bench, and on her second day initially issued a refund to a Bingham entity because the assessor’s website said a shopping center the tax buyer purchased for $1.4 million in back taxes sat on Dolton Avenue instead of Dolton Road. She later reversed herself, saying that the difference between the address being on an avenue versus a road meant nothing financially.She has since made a crucial ruling that–despite the local reference in the title–a Cook County Circuit Clerk is a state official and not a county one, and thus mistakes such as the clerk sending out late legal notices to property owners that their taxes have been sold can’t yield interest for tax buyers who request refunds from the county for sales in error.And in a trial last month, Hannon similarly ruled Stonefield Investments, a New Jersey-based investment fund specializing in real estate and tax liens, could get its money back for its 2017 purchase of a piece of the Kennedy Expressway on property it didn’t know was a highway at the time for $1.4 million in late taxes. It never should have been offered for sale, and only was because it was wrongly classified as a taxable parcel. In 2020, three years after its purchase, it asked for a sale in error refund with interest. But, while the judge gave back the company’s initial investment, she declined to grant the company $1 million in interest it asked to receive for the mistake, after the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office took the rare step of objecting to awarding the interest.Stonefield leadership made it clear during deposition and trial that it viewed Illinois’ sale-in-error statutes as a “safety-net” for tax sale investors, and that there’s more security bidding at Cook County auctions without doing as much due diligence as is standard for tax sale deals in other states, the study said.“It’s almost implausible to me and inconceivable that they would spend $1.4 million without, at the barest minimum, accessing the assessor’s website that has a picture of a highway on it,” Hannon said, according to the study. Attempts to reach Stonefield’s lawyer in the case, Terry Carter, were not successful.Changing the law by lowering the maximum rate of interest that tax buyers can receive per year, for instance, or disallowing refunds due to owners bankruptcy cases and clerical mistakes on the assessor’s website could clamp down on the small pool of tax buyers exploiting mistakes and the legal landscape to cash in on interest from sales in error.Skeptics of such changes, though, say they could thin down the pool of buyers, scaring them off by shrinking the safety net and thus remove an important source of funding for governments that would then have to fight delinquent taxpayers on their own.“I believe it’s a select few tax buyers that appear to be abusing the sale in error statute,” said Chicago tax sale attorney Emmett McCarthy. “If you tweak the statute to clamp down on these few you risk creating a harsher environment for the vast majority of tax buyers seeking to acquire real estate through tax sales. That may drive down the number of bidders, which would ultimately hurt taxpayers, property owners and the county.”Other experts disagree, pointing to the fact that some of the buyers Pappas’ office is taking issue with also do business in other states, where the rules aren’t as lax and buyers are warned of the potential to lose their investment because of ensuing bankruptcy filings, and aren’t granted interest on deals unwound over typos on government databases.“Sophisticated investors should be required to do due diligence,” said Ralph Martire, executive director of bipartisan Chicago nonprofit Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, who read an early version of the treasurer’s study. “Even if you’re a mom and pop investor, it’s basic due diligence to know the owner isn’t in bankruptcy. It’s not an onerous requirement. If they can’t track down payment from the owner, then utilize the lien they get to go after the property. If you don’t have the capacity to do that you shouldn’t do this kind of investment.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The deal marks the completion of a conversion of 122 hotel rooms — a quarter of the 500 previously there — into 78 studio and one-bedroom timeshare units that Orlando-based Hilton Grand Vacations agreed to buy in phases for $54 million.The four bulk sales of timeshare units posted in Cook County records since that agreement was made with Hilton Grand total just $45 million, and a termination of the timeshare sales agreement was also recently filed on the property along with Hilton Grand’s latest closing on a $15 million chunk of units.Related and Hilton Grand didn’t respond to requests for comment on the discrepancy nor the final cost of the conversion project, which was started well before the pandemic bludgeoned travel. Chicago’s tourism sector has lagged the recovery of other cities, yet records show dozens of timeshares have been sold by Hilton Grand for prices as much as the low six figures over the past two years. The property’s overall performance since its repositioning isn’t clear.Related wrested control of the property from San Francisco’s Chartres Lodging Group, which gave its lender the keys in 2018 in lieu of battling a foreclosure after defaulting on debt, although it remained an investor in the property.Chartres’ ownership was stymied by an expanding supply of Chicago hotel rooms last decade. Some 6,000 were added between 2014 and 2017, when its Ohio Street property fell into distress just after the company lost two other Chicago hotels to foreclosure.Oversupply remains a factor in the recovery from the health crisis and was cited by California’s Sunstone for its decision to sell two Hilton-operated hotels in Chicago for $130 million this year, a big drop from their pre-pandemic valuations.Hilton Grand last year also bought a Midtown Manhattan hotel under development while the property was in distress for $58 million from a lender.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",300 East Ohio Street

The suit charges the joint venture of the two Chicago developers hasn’t made payments on a $47 million loan tied to the hotel since February, according to Crain’s.The hotel owners owe $51.4 million as of July 1, including interest and other charges, according to the suit, which was filed June 29 in Cook County court.Four months ago, a servicer appointed to monitor the loan reported that the hotel owners faced a “critical cash flow crunch” due to falling performance, Crain’s reported at the time.Oxford President and CEO John Rutledge said in a statement the hotel is in negotiations to try to restructure its debt. Lawyer David Neff of Perkins Coie, which represents the lender, confirmed that negotiations are ongoing.The hotel in 2016 saw its property taxes balloon to $945,000 from $256,000 two years earlier, a significant blow at a time when Downtown hotel room inventory is growing. Some 6,000 new hotel rooms came online Downtown between 2014 and 2017, according to the city tourism bureau.The Hotel Felix isn’t the only Downtown hotel struggling: Denihan Hospitality recently sold the James Chicago hotel on the Magnificent Mile to Junius Real Estate Partners for $83 million, almost 40 percent less than what it paid a decade earlier.Oxford and Gettys bought the property for $24 million in 2007. The joint venture took out a $46 million loan on it, renovated then reopened in 2009 as the Hotel Felix.

Not all filings result in foreclosures.Chicago had one of the nation’s highest foreclosure rates as the end of moratoriums pushed the numbers back toward pre-pandemic levels. Some 0.30 percent of the city’s housing units had foreclosure filings, compared with the national rate of 0.12 percent.The data represents a slow, steady climb of foreclosures back to pre-pandemic levels, Rick Sharga, executive vice president of market intelligence at Attom, said in a statement.“While overall foreclosure activity is still running significantly below historic averages, the dramatic increase in foreclosure starts suggests that we may be back to normal levels by sometime in early 2023,” he said.The foreclosures were often on loans that were already in foreclosure or were more than 120 days delinquent before the pandemic.“Many of these loans were protected by the government’s foreclosure moratorium, or they would have already been foreclosed on two years ago,” he said. “There’s very little delinquency or default activity that’s truly new in the numbers we’re tracking.”Just seven of the 223 metro areas analyzed bucked the trend. Lake Havasu, Arizona; Eugene, Oregon; Springfield, Illinois; Shreveport, Louisiana; and Brownsville, Texas, had a lower foreclosure rate than in the first half of last year.Illinois had the highest foreclosure rate among states, at more than a quarter of a percent of housing units. Close behind were New Jersey, at 0.24 percent, Ohio at 0.21 percent, Delaware at 0.2 percent and South Carolina at 0.19 percent.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Gallagher and the insurance giant’s Rolling Meadows office (Credit: Leonardo Companies)Insurance giant Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. proposed expanding its Rolling Meadows headquarters with a new four-story, $45.6 million building that would house 700 more employees.The move by the nation’s fourth-largest commercial insurance brokerage hinges on state and local tax incentives, with Gallagher also considering leasing cheaper space near Houston, where the company has 460 employees, according to the Daily Herald.In 2014, Gallagher paid $13.4 million for the large office tower at 2850 Golf Road in Rolling Meadows, Crain’s reported at the time. It had been in Itasca for 26 years. The same year, the state awarded the company nearly $21 million in incentives spread over a decade to remain in Illinois as part of its move to the new campus.Gallagher then spent some $100 million renovating the 11-story, 315,000-square-foot building.The firm now employees about 1,500 people at the Rolling Meadows site, which also includes a separate two-story building for its information technology and mail departments, according to the Daily Herald. The new structure would go on a 352,000-square-foot parcel and feature conference rooms, “huddle rooms” and phone rooms workstations.Gallagher has applied for a county tax incentive that would reduce its property tax assessment for 12 years. The company also is seeking more incentives from the state.Construction could begin next year and be finished by the end of 2021, the company said.A report by JLL said office properties in the area are in demand, with suburban vacancy rates at their lowest around O’Hare Airport.

12:13 PM","Essex Realty’s Steven Livaditis may have been the last broker in Chicago to close a condo deconversion deal during its glory days, when only 75 percent of sellers had to approve a bulk sale.","[""Alderman Brendan Reilly (Credit: iStock)Essex Realty’s Steven Livaditis may have been the last broker in Chicago to close a condo deconversion deal during its glory days, when only 75 percent of sellers had to approve a bulk sale.Hours before a new rule upping the deconversion threshold to 85 percent of sellers went into effect, his client closed on a 26-unit condo building in Edgewater. Several attorneys told him that other condo associations around Chicago were scrambling to get their votes through before the deadline.“Having gone through this process hundreds of times over the last five years, I can tell you that it’s very, very difficult to get over 85 percent,” Livaditis said, estimating that only about half of the deals that he’s closed have exceeded that threshold.Deconversions, or turning condos into rental apartments, have tripled in dollar volume yearly in Chicago since 2016 — but this year, the market is highly unlikely to see any growth at all, according to an analysis by The Real Deal.1250 North LaSalle Drive (Credit: Coldwell Banker Homes)The full City Council approved the ordinance last month, with co-sponsor Alderman Brendan Reilly calling it a protection against displacement for longtime residents. The new, higher threshold for owner approval on bulk condo sales went into effect on Wednesday.The smart mathThe Chicago deconversion market has drawn investors who are seeking the upside in renovating older apartments at market-rate rents, but don’t want the risk or the higher costs of ground-up development. Often, investors already own a high number of units in the condo building before lodging an official deconversion bid, a way of ensuring a majority vote.Essex Realty’s Steven LivaditisFor them, the math is simple: ground-up development in Chicago can easily hit $400 a square foot. But a savvy investor can take control of a condo building, renovate the units, find tenants and get liquidity flowing in just months. All for under $300 a foot in a hot rental market.But it’s not for the meek — competition can be fierce and the condo owners are often unwilling sellers. Earlier this month, condo owners at Lake Point Tower beat back an effort to force a deconversion of the 758-unit high-rise, prohibiting any individual owner from controlling more than 2 percent of units.Investors are mostly targeting properties where they are sure the owners will be eager to cut a deal, said Interra Realty broker Joe Smazal, who has completed at least eight deconversion deals. Sellers can achieve a 25 percent premium on the value of their home, and they’re often motivated to sell if the building needs repairs and has deferred maintenance, said Avison Young’s Jim Hanson, who commissioned a study on deconversions in Chicago.Those types of deals were already becoming rare before the new rules took effect, according to property investor David Ruttenberg. “It’s been a quieter year,” he said. “The low-hanging peaches have been picked.”Bigger deals, but fewer of themIn 2016, buyers collectively spent $53.5 million on condo deconversions. Since then, that amount has tripled each year, totaling $523 million in 2018, according to a TRD analysis of closed property transactions and brokers’ sales records. But through September 2019, only $240.5 million in deconversions had been announced (many have not closed). At this rate, 2019 sales will likely check in around the $300 million mark — a little more than half of last year’s total, according to our analysis.Investors who are closing deals are stomaching higher prices — per unit costs this year are up 10 percent over last year, our analysis found.2 East Oak Street (Credit: Google Maps)The upward pressure on prices at a time when “skyrocketing” property assessments have upped taxes, said Livaditis, and the prospect of rate hikes in Illinois have driven down the confidence of investors and developers alike, despite continued demand from the Chicago rental market.“That’s the No. 1 concern for investors in the city of Chicago that can significantly hurt or benefit deconversion,” said Livaditis, who is the principal and managing director of Essex.Since 2016, the number of transactions has not grown as aggressively as the dollar volume and number of units purchased, suggesting a slight trend toward fewer but bigger purchases.“It started with the smaller deconversions in the neighborhoods, then it moved to the downtown market. And with that, the properties got much larger,” said Integra Realty’s Gail Lissner, who specializes in deconversion sales.David RuttenbergRuttenberg, who’s the managing partner at Ruttenberg Gordon Investments and principal at Marc Realty Capital, was involved in the largest deconversion in Chicago’s history when just over 75 percent of owners voted in favor of deconverting the 449-unit River City building in the South Loop. Due to the scale of the building, he wonders where $90.5 million deal would’ve stood if it had to reach the 85 percent threshold because that means the owners of about 45 additional condos would’ve had to be on board.Livaditis believes deconversions in Chicago will continue, but not with the same velocity seen over recent years.“There’s no question, but there needs to be better transparency and clarity between all of the parties involved so everyone fully understands the pluses and minuses of going through this process,” he said. “I think 85 percent is a very high barter reach, but I think it is possible if you have the right support, meaning if the deal does make sense.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1250 North LaSalle Drive

07:30 AM",A multifamily landlord in Chicago faces growing opposition to plans to buy suburban condo buildings and turn them into rentals after a two-year housing boom left few affordable options for condo unit owners who sell.,"[""Brian Cunat with 4300 West Shamrock Lane in McHenry and an aerial of Cunat Court in Lake in the Hills (Materra Wines, Cunat, Google Maps)A multifamily landlord in Chicago faces growing opposition to plans to buy suburban condo buildings and turn them into rentals after a two-year housing boom left few affordable options for condo unit owners who sell.Cunat, a suburban landlord and multifamily developer, has a pending offer of just under $34 million on a condo complex of about 300 units named Prairie Point in the village of Lake in the Hills, a distant northwest suburb. That’s an increase of almost $4 million from a previous offer that condo owners rejected. It also follows Cunat’s offer of $11 million for a condo complex in nearby McHenry, the Greens of Irish Prairie, that was supported by the required 75 percent of condo unit owners but is now being challenged in court.“These are never easy deals to do,” said Gail Lissner, managing director of Integra Realty Resources in Chicago. “It really takes a buyer with expertise in the field. It’s not like buying a stabilized apartment asset.”Successfully – and profitably – converting condos to rentals is complicated even further by Chicago’s housing boom, which has driven prices up by more than 10 percent. Some of the biggest gains have come in the suburbs as buyers seek better accommodations to work from home during the pandemic.While Cunat’s offers might look good on paper, in practice, the unit owners would struggle to find comparable housing. At least one owner says the law entitles sellers to funding for replacement housing on top of what they get for a sale. That could amount to tens of thousands of dollars per condo owner and further upend the market for deconversions.Cunat, which owns properties with thousands of apartment units throughout the Chicago suburbs, is seeking to buy condo complexes it developed with hundreds of units each in McHenry and Lake in the Hills to turn into units exclusively for lease.Cunat didn’t return requests for comment.The company made its offer for the McHenry complex in September, and it was approved by its owners, who included a large portion of votes that were already held or acquired by Cunat through individual condo unit purchases within the last 18 months.Two residents who objected are now being sued by the property’s condo board, which has alleged they refused to comply with the terms of the sale by not signing closing documents and continuing to live in their condos, and seeks to compel them to accept the sale and move out or lease their units back.“Next month it’ll be a year I’m in limbo land, paying for a condo that’s going to be stolen from me,” said Ken Dill, one of the holdout owners in McHenry. He would get just $66,500 for his unit, down almost 28 percent from the $92,000 he paid in 2007, if the Cunat deconversion deal closes.Dill says that under a 2018 amendment to the Illinois law governing condo building sales, he’s entitled to receive replacement housing costs from the proceeds of the sale in addition to what he gets for his individual unit.His argument may have merit, according to R. Kymn Harp, an Illinois real estate attorney who doesn’t represent Dill. There’s little case law involving the amendment, Harp said.Hearings in the lawsuits against Dill and the other McHenry holdout are set for Feb. 10.Median home prices in Chicago’s nine-county metro area, which includes the condo projects Cunat is eyeing, gained 8.7 percent in December 2021 over the same time the previous year, rising to $288,000, according to the trade group Illinois Realtors, and the supply of homes hitting the market has tightened, a trend Coldwell Banker’s Dawn McKenna told The Real Deal she expects to continue to drive prices up in the suburbs in 2022.With condo units selling for about $100,000 in Lake in the Hills and less than that in McHenry as part of the proposed deconversion sales, there would be little else owners could buy for similar prices in the suburban market, where condo deconversions are generally trickier to complete because residents have fewer replacement housing options, said Andy Friedman, director of Kiser Group, a mid-market multi-family brokerage in Chicago.Even if the prices were 30 percent higher, residents would still have little available to them at that price, and may have to enter the rental market if they intend to stay in the suburbs, he said. For that reason, Cunat, if it completes the deconversions, would be “feeding its own rental market” with any displaced condo unit residents, Friedman said.“I can’t buy anything nearby with that $130,000,’’ Friedman said. That’s not something a broker can fix. I can solve a lot of problems through a deconversion, but I can’t create available condo housing in the suburbs.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

In the central business district, the vacancy rate jumped to 15.1 percent, in large part because of the coronavirus crisis. That’s up from 13.8 percent in the first quarter, and came only months after the office market posted its best year. Of the 6.5 million square feet of office space under construction, less than half had been pre-leased, according to the report.New York-based Vista is already deeply invested in Chicago, with 19 properties that comprise a majority of its 34 holdings.In December, the company paid $17 million for a 48,000-square-foot brick office building at 435 N.

The gym and rooftop deck and lounge that Toronto-based developer Brownfield Properties added to the Marshall Field building helped draw Vivid Seats out of the trendier West Loop neighborhood, CBRE’s Brad Serot, who negotiated the lease on behalf of Vivid, told Crain’s.“Our new headquarters is not just an investment in Chicago’s growing tech sector, it’s an investment in our current and future employees,” a Vivid spokesperson said in a statement to Crain’s. “This space will support a larger workforce and hybrid model with shared and collaborative workspaces.”Its departure from Canal Street presents a challenge for JPMorgan, which owns the 16-story Gogo Building building.

LaSalle in Chicago (Brookfield Properties, Loopnet)Lenders are taking control of two big office buildings in the Chicago Loop that were struggling before the pandemic and have fallen further behind on their loans.Loop office landlord defaults on the riseCanada’s Brookfield Asset Management is turning over its 22-floor, 1.4 million-square-foot building at 175 West Jackson Boulevard to its lender after becoming delinquent on a $258 million loan, which was sent to special servicing in November, Bisnow reported earlier, citing loan data tracker Trepp.Its occupancy was just 63 percent as of January, according to a Morningstar analysis of the loan, for which LNR Partners is special servicer.Another distressed property in the Loop, 135 South LaSalle Street, owned by New York-based AmTrust Realty, is also set to have its deed handed to a special servicer, after falling behind on payments toward a $100 million loan, Bisnow reported, citing Trepp. The loan’s special servicer is Torchlight Investors, which has agreed to skip filing a foreclosure suit if it gets keys to the LaSalle building, a transaction in negotiations, Crain’s reported, citing Bloomberg data.The seizures by the lenders are the most prominent examples of how Chicago’s office market has been slammed by the coronavirus. The rise of remote work drained the pool of potential replacement tenants for properties that were already facing the loss of large leases ahead of the health crisis, and there could be more trouble ahead in Chicago and across the nation if leaseholders decide to shrink their footprints.While pedestrian counts are up in downtown areas of Chicago, San Francisco and Houston, exciting retailers, office landlords don’t yet have much to celebrate as workers were entering offices at just 41 percent of 2019 levels in the country’s 10 largest office markets as of March 9, according to Kastle, which provides commercial real estate security equipment and software. Many professionals expect to enter the office just three days a week even as the pandemic eases, which could give companies reason to shrink their footprints in downtown buildings.The LaSalle property, known as the Field Building, was hurt by longtime tenant Bank of America’s decision to vacate 830,000 square feet last year to move into its namesake tower, a 57-story building at 110 North Wacker Drive. The value of Field has dropped by $200 million to about $130 million since 2015, leaving the property owner just above water on its loan, according to The Real Deal reporting on a recent appraisal.“[AmTrust’s] apparent willingness to hand over keys is also an obvious negative.

The eminent domain action came after the chocolate company’s offer to buy Eychaner’s land for $825,000 was rejected, according to the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin.Eychaner fought the use of eminent domain to seize his land, setting off a years-long legal battle over the property and its value. A court upheld the city’s use of eminent domain in the case, but it rejected the city’s assessment of the land’s value, according to reports.Eventually a jury awarded Eychaner $2.5 million for the land, but he appealed that amount.The battle culminated with a judge’s order to award Eychaner $7.1 million plus interest, according to a court order issued Dec. 18.Eychaner, a businessman and philanthropist who founded printing company Newsweb, could not be reached for comment, and his attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Chicago Department of Law did not immediately return a request seeking comment.The area of River West that includes the Blommer Chocolate factory and Eychaner’s former land has undergone a transformation since the legal saga began.In 2016, Akara Partners and CA Ventures completed a 227-unit apartment tower in the neighborhood, a property the partners listed for the second time this fall. A block north, Tandem Partners and Rambaud Holdings are building a 23-story mixed-use project at 730 North Milwaukee Avenue.Also nearby, Tribune Media Company is planning a redevelopment of its printing plant into a 30-acre campus with up to 9 million square feet of residential, retail and office space.The family that owned Blommer Chocolate Co. sold the company late last year to Japan-based Fuji Oil Holdings. The company’s River West factory is well known in Chicago for frequently wafting the smell of chocolate through Downtown when the wind is right.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",468 North Jefferson Street

State Street (Credit: Google Maps)As landlords braced for a huge drop in April rent payments amid the coronavirus-fueled meltdown, Rampante Realty Partners saw that fear hit home.The investment firm is now suing the anchor tenant at its Loop office building, Robert Morris University, for skipping out on a $1 million April rent payment, according to Crain’s.But Covid-19 wasn’t the only factor in the university’s decision not to pay.Robert Morris has leased 355,000 square feet at Rampante Realty’s 401 S. State St. location since 1996. The university vacated the eight-story building recently, after it was acquired by Roosevelt University.Rampante Realty’s suit also names Roosevelt University as a defendant. As the 487,000-square-foot building’s only tenant, Robert Morris left the location empty, still owing what would amount to “tens of millions of dollars” in rent payments for the remaining four years on the lease, Crain’s cited in the lawsuit.Rampante Realty’s suit in Cook County court comes more than a year after the investment firm listed the historic office property for $100 million. That amount is a significant markup from the company’s $68 million purchase in 2016 — it did put $5 million in improvements into the building.Unable to unload the prime asset despite a strong office market, Rampante Realty now finds itself in hot water with creditors for its own missed April payment. The company helped pay for the building with a $48 million acquisition loan, and has skipped out on a $168,000 April debt service obligation, Crain’s reported, citing Bloomberg. Its creditors are Wells Fargo and Morrison Street Capital.\nMeanwhile, Roosevelt University was given the go-ahead to purchase Robert Morris, as both schools tried to bolster their sagging enrollment and sinking financials. Chicago-based Roosevelt University in late 2018 sold off 125,000 square feet of space at the Gauge Building on Michigan Avenue to National St. Louis University for $15 million.

The short-term rental company Sonder purchased 92 units in the building soon after it was completed last year.The building’s sale comes at a time when commercial real estate deals have dropped off since the onset of the pandemic as investors remain uncertain about pricing and occupancy.At the same time, Chicago’s rental market has surged in recent years, driven by a number of large companies — including Google and McDonald’s — opening local headquarters and flagships in the city.Developers were increasingly converting condo developments into apartments in a process known as “condo deconversion.” But deconversions in Chicago have become tougher after the city passed a rule that requires 85 percent of a building’s condo owners to approve a bulk sale, up from 75 percent.Nationally, landlords are starting to show some financial strains. About 6 million renters reported either missing, delaying or paying reduced rent during the second quarter of the year, according to a recent report from the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Non-profit developer LUCHA, the Spanish word for struggle, aims to improve housing for low-income Latin and African-American communities.“Affordable housing is a human right,” said Lisette Castañeda, LUCHA executive director. “It really says that for our communities, this is what’s important, and our elected officials are listening to us.”A project aimed at combating gentrification-fueled displacement, church leaders partnered with LUCHA to renovate the Humboldt Park Methodist Church, home to existing 12 apartments, and add 10 units. The City Council approved the project in December 2020, but the $11 million project needs about $7 million more in addition to the existing funds from the government and the state.Initially built for a German congregation in 1928, the Spanish-speaking Humboldt Park United Methodist took over the church in 1968 and has become a community hub offering free legal aid to immigrants. In 1989, the congregation started a ministry helping the homeless and built 10 affordable housing apartments as displacement pressures continued to mount.“We as a congregation have lost our Latinx families who have been displaced out of this neighborhood through the evils of gentrification, Paula Cripps-Vallejo, Humboldt Park United Methodist Church’s reverend previously said.\nThe apartments, consisting of studios, one-, two-, and three-bedrooms, will be available only for households earning up to 60 percent of the area median income, the city’s requirements under the Affordable Requirements Ordinance.LUCHA was one of the 10 developers awarded funding with support from Representative Jesús García. Other projects that were granted federal funds include St. Anthony Hospital, which received $923,000 to build a campus in Little Village and Brighton Park Neighborhood Council that was awarded about $1 million to set up a new community center.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2122 North Mozart Street

It already has offices in the area, comprising the entire 230,000-square-foot Sterling Bay building at 320 North Morgan Street, and another lease at 210 North Carpenter Street for a total of 500,000 square feet in the area.Trammell Crow developed the 425,000-square-foot building at 400 North Aberdeen on speculation with no tenants signed in advance, meaning the Google lease is another boon for Fulton Market. The area landed top-tier tenants even through the pandemic and is the city’s only office district where vacancies declined during the crisis.Google’s commitment Wednesday to physical workplaces – its parent company plans a $9.5 billion investment in offices and data centers, up from $7.5 billion last year – is also good news for wider downtown office markets struggling with vacancies. Its move to 320 North Morgan almost a decade ago sparked corporate migrations to the former Chicago meatpacking district now teeming with busy retail between shiny new office towers.Google could even further expand from the 200,000 square feet it is considering on Aberdeen. It aims to keep hiring in Chicago to add its 1,800 local employees, with several hundred hired in the last two years and plans to add more, Crain’s reported.Even more Chicago square footage could have been occupied by the company if not for the pandemic. It had a deal with Sterling Bay to build a new 18-story building at 1000 West Carroll Avenue that Google would have owned, but it was shelved as the pandemic struck Illinois in 2020, Crain’s reported, citing a 2020 lawsuit involving the former Ace Hotel near the site.Trammell Crow landing Google is also a shift from the tenants it was expecting at the site. The 16-story structure was built as a life sciences lab, and remains mostly empty after its completion earlier this year.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",400 North Aberdeen Street

One local developer is betting it can.Gary Pachucki is working to redevelop three warehouse buildings in the 1300 block of North Kostner Avenue into a mixed-use complex, featuring retail and “creative work space” the developer is calling Humboldt Lit.The loft-style office space will be marketed toward companies in creative fields, which may have been priced out of Fulton Market years ago, said Pachucki, who leads development firm IBT Group.“We’re trying to provide a vertical creative work environment that doesn’t exist in Chicago,” Pachucki said. Cowley Chicago’s urban development team will market the new office space. The buildout is being spearheaded by Ratio Architects.IBT Group is under contract for the three warehouse facilities currently occupied by a furniture company, Pachucki said. The total project is slated to cost about $50 million, including potential extensive buildouts for technology firms.The plan is to turn the 6-plus-acre property into a campus-style office development with 240,000 square feet of space dedicated to retail and office uses. The space could accommodate a number of tenants, or have a single tenant, Pachucki said. He envisions uses like a coffee shop and a bike store. There will be about 1 acre of outdoor space.The booming Fulton Market, which home to trendy restaurants and hotels, along with gleaming office towers, already commands the most expensive rental rates of any submarket. Increasingly, traditional corporate tenants — like Ernst & Young — have moved into the neighborhood.Humboldt Park is an increasingly popular neighborhood, at least for homeowners, with the neighborhood seeing escalating home values and tax bills.Fulton Market’s office and residential developments have steadily inched westward, with projects popping up closer to Ashland Avenue.This is not IBT Group’s first foray into the speculative West Side development game. In 2009, the firm purchased a 4-acre warehouse in the 1100 block of West Jackson Boulevard with plans for 300 residences, a Mariano’s and a movie theater. With the recession throttling development, IBT’s financing partners backed out, though the firm helped to develop a Target store on the site.Pachucki also hasn’t abandoned Fulton Market entirely, The firm has a project in the works there, though it was too early to discuss.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1300 block of North Kostner Avenue

One, on Forest Place, is listed for $5.2 million. The other, on Church Street, is listed for $4.2 million.She’s also listing a three-flat on Lake Shore Drive in Lakeview for $4.8 million — $4 million less than she paid for it, according to Crain’s.Kimberlee Carr at Tawani’s in-house brokerage Honnete Real Estate has the listings.In March she sold a 4,000-square-foot home on Judson Avenue in Evanston for $1.2 million, and listed a 19th century rowhouse at 1234 North State Parkway in Chicago for $4 million. In February she listed a Winnetka mansion for $3.9 million.Last year she put on the market another Evanston mansion for $2 million, and has since lowered the asking price below $1.6 million. The home has a contingent contract with a buyer, according to Crain’s.Pritzker, who retired from the Army in 2001 as a lieutenant colonel, is part of the Pritzker family of billionaires that includes her cousins, Gov.

Willis Tower marks the sixth Illinois location for the tenant, which manufactures electrical and fiber optic hardware.Companies have leased a combined 500,000 square feet inside the city’s tallest tower since the beginning of 2017, and rents there have spiked about 25 percent over the same period, according to Telos Group, which oversees leasing for the 3.8 million-square-foot skyscraper.The flurry of leasing coincides with an ongoing $668 million renovation that’s set to add more than 300,000 square feet of retail and entertainment space to the Willis Tower complex, including a new food hall operated by Urbanspace, in 2020.New York-based Blackstone bought the former Sears Tower in 2015 for $1.3 billion, then the most expensive office transaction ever recorded outside of New York City. Earlier this year, the property owner refinanced the property with a record $1.3 billion loan.A growing glut of Downtown office space is pressuring landlords to either renovate their buildings or shell out for tenant concessions in order to fill space, analysts reported this year.The 94 percent occupancy rate puts the Willis Tower on strong footing compared to the rest of the Downtown office market, where occupancy has hovered around 87 percent this year.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The joint venture also sold the Embassy Suites Rosemont for $24.4 million. The deals closed in late May.By selling the two properties for a total $52.8 million, the joint venture took a significant loss. The venture bought the hotels in two separate deals for a combined $100 million, not including money spent on upgrades, property records show.New Jersey-based PGIM and Seattle-based Dow Hotel bought the 369-key DoubleTree at 5460 North River Road in 2007 in a land lease deal for $61.4 million, according to property records. In 2000, the group picked up the 294-room Embassy Suites at 5500 North River Road for $39 million before spending $10 million in renovations.Minnesota-based Nath Companies and Chicago-based Syndicated Equities Group bought the two hotels from PGIM and Dow last month. TCF Bank provided two loans totaling $46.3 million to finance the deals, records show.The sales come as the O’Hare hotel submarket is riding high. Revenue per available room in the O’Hare market jumped 6 percent year over year last summer, and the airport itself is in the midst of an $8.5 billion expansion and overhaul that will allow it to serve an additional 20 million passengers per year and potentially bring in more guests to area hotels.The O’Hare market even withstood a downturn that hit the overall Chicago hotel industry in the first quarter, and it has not seen an influx of new hotel inventory as Downtown has, hotel consultant Ted Mandigo said.The O’Hare market had even better years leading up to the recession. That, combined with a lack of available sites for new hotels, caused some buyers to pay top-dollar for hotel properties in the market at the time, Mandigo said.PGIM and Dow bought the DoubleTree in 2007, just before the recession. If it sold near its previous price of $61 million, it would have been the priciest O’Hare hotel deal since 2015, when the Westin O’Hare traded for $82 million.Since then, the highest price paid for a hotel in the submarket came in March 2018, when a Hong Kong firm paid $37 million for the Rosemont Hilton as part of a $650 portfolio sale.The value of properties in the are has dropped so much because many are in need of improvements, Mandigo said. And the expansion and redevelopment of O’Hare could make matters worse for existing innkeepers by increasing competition: The project could bring as many as three new hotels to the area, he said.“It’s a very competitive market,” said Mandigo, of TR Mandigo & Company. “There are a number of projects that could come on board. That dampened the enthusiasm of some.”PGIM declined to comment on the deal, and Dow Hotel did not respond to requests for comment. A representative for Nath Companies did not respond to requests for comment. A principal at Syndicated confirmed the company’s preferred equity interest in the deal, but did not disclose the terms of the deal.Nath Companies’ first acquisition in Chicago was in 2017, when the firm picked up the 385-room Renaissance Chicago North Shore in Northbrook for $30 million, Crain’s reported at the time.

Telos oversees leasing at the massive building.The Old Post Office is 80-percent leased, but it remains to be seen how the added amenities will help fill the vacant space. Chicago’s office market has sunk and vacancy rates have shot up.

A spokesperson for Kushner did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.Angelo Gordon has stakes in several Chicago-area properties, and earlier this year teamed with Chicago-based GlenStar Properties in April to buy the Presidents Plaza office towers near O’Hare Airport for $148 million.AJ Capital was a joint investor with Shapack Partners in the Soho House property in Fulton Market.

The trends are encouraging given that they also coincide with a surge of Omicron cases in the area.The average number of pedestrians on State Street and the occupancy rate for Loop hotels both hit 64 percent of December 2019 levels. The pedestrian rate is the highest on record since the start of the pandemic and the hotel occupancy rate ties the pandemic-era high set in July, capping off a four month rally to end the year. Chicago’s hotel industry has been distressed for some time now.The office occupancy rate peaked at 38 percent of 2019 levels, just off the peak set in late November. While that may seem low, Chicago’s occupancy rate outperformed New York and the San Francisco Bay Area.Activity in the neighborhood was likely boosted by holiday attractions, but Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs Commissioner Erin Harkey said ongoing events could sustain the recovery.“We’re hopeful that this increase in pedestrian activity will continue throughout 2022 as new arts and culture experiences open and Chicagoans and tourists alike aim to enjoy the Loop this winter,” she said. “Workers and visitors are vital to our city’s creative economy, and the central business district is buoyed by their energy.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

11:02 AM",Arlington Heights-area residents against using incentives to bring the Chicago Bears to the suburb are speaking out against a potential tax increment financing district and the chance it drains needed revenue from local schools.,"[""Arlington Racecourse and Arlington village manager Randy Recklaus (Arlington Park, LinkedIn)Arlington Heights-area residents against using incentives to bring the Chicago Bears to the suburb are speaking out against a potential tax increment financing district and the chance it drains needed revenue from local schools.Under a TIF arrangement, property taxes above a certain amount would go toward the NFL team’s mixed-use project instead of the local Palatine Township Elementary District, and school officials are already rallying against any such proposal, the Daily Herald reported.While the Bears have said they would redevelop Arlington International Racecourse into a new stadium without using taxpayer dollars, the NFL team has requested local government assistance to subsidize costs of building infrastructure for the entertainment district and mixed use development around the stadium that will include housing, offices and retail. The total project cost has been estimated at $5 billion.“We want a seat at the table,” District 15 Superintendent Laurie Heinz said at a recent community meeting. “We’re going to fight against it all being TIF’ed because we will need money.”If the taxpayer money is diverted away from the school, Heinz says the district will need to seek financial assistance from elsewhere to finance school expansions made necessary partly by the growth the Bears plans would bring.Tax increment districts are popular with Illinois developers as they offer a buffer against property tax hikes for more than the initial two decades after a project is complete, as they allow the value of a parcel to increase without facing higher taxes. Local governments dependent on property taxes to support expansions of public services demanded by growth, though, often oppose them.“They know what we’re looking for,” Heinz said. “And whether it’s land or income, we likely are going to need to build additions.”The Arlington International Racecourse, which the NFL team signed a $197 million purchase agreement for in September 2021, is located entirely within the boundaries of the K-8 school district that covers Palatine, Rolling Meadows, Hoffman Estates and Inverness and parts of Arlington Heights, South Barrington and Schaumburg. The district includes 15 elementary schools, four junior high schools and an alternative preschool, making it the second-largest elementary district in the state.In addition to the existing need to expand the schools, Heinz pointed out that the Bears’ plan includes residential space, which would likely lead to more students living in the area, and therefore even more crowded schools.“My job is to make sure the impact is properly considered and addressed throughout the development process so that District 15 is prepared for potential changes and not negatively impacted by the project,” Heinz said in her letter to the village manager. “District 15 taxpayers … cannot be left to shoulder the costs of the development as it may affect our schools.”While a majority of Arlington Heights village board members have spoken positively of the proposal so far, Mayor Tom Hayes recently said “it’s certainly possible” that local officials reject the plans altogether.— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

That’s all I want to see.”The case, which features 89 plaintiffs, was certified as class-action earlier this month.New York-based Symmetry, alongside local partner Fordham Real Estate, proposed the 60-story Carillon tower in the first block of East Superior Street, which would have featured 246 condo units, 216 hotel rooms and 120 timeshare units. After Reilly rejected it, Symmetry has continued to pursue demolition of the buildings on the site, which has angered preservationists and Reilly himself.Symmetry, run by Jeffrey Leyton, is chiefly relying on the legal argument that because they’re still pursuing the project, the investors aren’t owed any funds. In all, EB-5 investors each contributed $550,000 to the Chicago project, totaling about $50 million.In 2017, Chicago developer Anshoo Sethi received a three-year prison sentence for scamming Chinese investors in a proposed $900 million hotel project.

There is no published asking price, Stern said.But a lawyer for MCZ Development, which owns a number of units in the building, said it will oppose the sale.“They might as well throw in the Brooklyn Bridge and the Sears Tower” into the offering, attorney Bill Choslovsky told Crain’s. “They can’t deliver those and they can’t deliver this building.”MCZ last month sued the board, claiming it illegally changed the association’s rules to try to thwart the developer from buying more units in the building.Key to the spat will be how much of the building MCZ actually owns. Illinois law requires 75 percent of ownership to approve of a bulk sale of a condo building.Choslovsky said his client owns more than 25 percent. Crain’s could only find Cook County records showing 24 condos owned by MCZ, though another attorney for the firm previously said the number was 31, with several more under contract.But the 75 percent threshold is based on the total value of the condominium, not on the total number of units, making it more unclear if MCZ owns the 25 percent of the building to block the sale.Representatives of the association did not respond to requests for comment from Crain’s.

Japanese bank Sumitomo Mitsui provided a $76 million acquisition loan. The deal closed March 27, records show.Developed by Chicago-based CA and Keith Giles, the building known as Eleven40 was delivered last year and was nearly 90 percent leased in four months. The building includes a mix of studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms renting from $1,492 to $3,216. CA and Giles took out a $51 million construction loan in 2016 to finance the project.This is Diamond Realty’s first multifamily acquisition in the Chicago market, according to its website. The California-based firm also owns two student housing complexes and 14 industrial properties throughout the state. Diamond Realty could not be reached for comment.The Eleven40 deal is just the latest sell-off for CA.Earlier this year, CA and Akara Partners sold a 227-unit River West complex to Newcastle for $85 million. The developers originally tried to sell the complex in 2017 but pulled it off the market after failing to get their price.The team of CA and Giles sold their South Loop student housing complex in October to DWS Group for $76.8 million.Even as it’s sold off some of its local holdings, CA is continuing to invest and develop in the market. The firm is working to build a 261-unit apartment building in Old Town. It has also launched an industrial division, promising to invest $500 million in the markets across the country.A representative for CA did not immediately return a request for comment.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1140 South Wabash Avenue

03:00 PM","When Toys “R” Us announced its liquidation last month,  it was expected that some Chicago area retail landlords would be hit hard.","[""(Credit: Wikipedia, Max Pixel, Pixabay)When Toys “R” Us announced its liquidation last month,\xa0 it was expected that some Chicago area retail landlords would be hit hard.Among them could be Chicago-based Bonnie Investment Group, owner of Bricktown Square, a 292,000-square-foot shopping center in the Montclare neighborhood on the West Side, according to Crain’s.The firm has a $2.2 million annual commitment to pay back a $32 million mortgage for the property. The loss of Babies “R” Us, its largest tenant there, could push the firm toward default on the loan.Things started going south for Bonnie at Bricktown Square last year. That’s when Sports Authority went bankrupt and about 36,000 square feet at the center went dark. Bonnie has been able to break up the space and has found a discount apparel retailer to take about 22,000 square feet that had been Sports Authority’s.But the loss of Babies “R” Us, which has a 45,000-square-foot spread at Bricktown Square — one of more than 700 stores Toys R Us is closing as part of its bankruptcy — could be more than the property can financially bear.Numbers cited by Crain’s show the center took in a net cash flow before debt service of about $2.23 million in 2016 — when it had more than $489,000 a year in base rent coming in from Babies “R” Us.Similar centers across the metro area could also find themselves in trouble in the coming months, as Toys “R” Us’ failed Chapter 11 bid impacts about 30 stores here.The recent lower-than-expected bid by Brookfield Property Partners to buy Chicago-based mall owner General Growth Properties served as a reminder that the industry is struggling to find an answer to the ways e-commerce is reshaping how people buy things.The Toys “R” Us liquidation won’t hit every landlord as hard as it will likely hit Bonnie.Connecticut-based Starwood Capital Group holds a ground lease for a 43,000-square-foot Toys “R” Us store at Louis Joliet Mall in Joliet.Tom Fink, senior vice president and managing director at the research firm Trepp, told Crain’s the bankruptcy should be a “non-issue” for Starwood, since the rent Toys “R” Us brought in amounts to a small piece of the pie at the large indoor mall.But at Oakridge Court Shopping Center in Algonquin, Toys “R” Us has a much larger, 64,000-square-foot space that accounts for nearly half of the center’s 146,000 rentable footprint. The loss of that much rented space all at once could spell trouble for the owners, Madison, Wisconsin-based E.J. Plesko & Associates and Chicago-based Equibase Capital Group. The joint venture developed the center in 2008, and holds an $18.7 million mortgage on it.\xa0[Crain’s] – Scott KlocksinAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The Tribune also is partnering with Riverside Investment & Development to continue the project on seven acres north of Chicago Avenue. The commission approved that plan separately earlier this year.The planned development approved Thursday outlines 14 buildings up to 650 feet tall scattered across the property and buffeted by green space, but details of each building have not been finalized. A press release last year predicted up to 5,900 residential units and 19,000 permanent jobs on the site by the time the entire development is fully realized.As part of the multi-year project, the city approved a plan to extend Jefferson Street through the center of the campus as a main thoroughfare.The developer also has vowed to create a publicly accessible riverwalk promenade along its entire 3,200-foot waterfront edge.The first phase of the plan proposes four towers combining for 1,500 apartments between Grand and Erie Street, at the south end of the site. Construction would get underway in early 2020, with the goal of accepting the first tenants by the end of 2021.The entire 37-acre development’s “master plan” will include 20 percent of apartments rented below market rate in accordance with the affordability “pilot zones” created by the city last year. []The developer will also take advantage of the city’s Downtown density bonus program to build with a higher floor-area ratio than would be otherwise permitted under the site’s zoning. In return, Tribune Media will pay about $13 million into the city’s fund for business improvement grants on the city’s South and West Sides.Members of the commission Thursday raised concerns over the development’s potential to clog traffic in the area, but a representative for Tribune Media said the company had worked with city transportation planners to add street extensions and connections that would help area roads absorb more cars.The site sits across the river from Groupon’s 16.5 million-square-foot headquarters at 600 West Chicago Avenue, which Sterling Bay bought earlier this year for $510 million.The Tribune site also faces the southern tip of Goose Island, where the Onni Group recently backed out of a bid to build apartments on the site of Greyhound’s 8-acre bus facility.Developers have swung their focus hard to the city’s North Branch Corridor since the city adopted a mass rezoning last year to encourage the construction of homes and offices on the traditionally industrial-dominated riverfront.Farther north on the river, Sterling Bay has plans for a sprawling mega-development of its own, Lincoln Yards. The Chicago-based developer is currently working through the approval process for that project with community groups and Alderman Brian Hopkins (2nd).All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",777 West Chicago Avenue

The lender made the claim a month after Madison Realty Capital filed a similar lawsuit, alleging that Symmetry owes about $8.7 million, including interest and late fees, after missing payments.The foreclosure bids are the latest problem for the New York-based development firm, which is also facing a lawsuit from 60 Chinese investors demanding to know what happened to the nearly $50 million they pumped into the project through the federal EB-5 program.The developer is also still seeking support from Alderman Brendan Reilly (42nd), who last year downzoned the property to block the proposal. And a city commission gave preliminary approval in March for a proposal by preservationists to landmark the existing buildings on the site, which would hamstring any development.Symmetry maintains that it did not default on its debt, and it denies any other wrongdoing. A spokesperson told Crain’s that the firm “continues to work with the alderman’s office to get the project approved and believes it will ultimately be successful in doing so.”The proposed tower would include 246 condos, 216 hotel rooms and 120 timeshare units.

Those new stations will create more foot traffic in South Side neighborhoods.“We’re talking about communities currently without these types of businesses and without a lot of people visiting the area because of limited public transportation,” Karen Freeman-Wilson, president and CEO of the Chicago Urban League, told the Business Journal. “But just as equally important to strengthening the economy on the Far South Side is more housing built.

10:52 AM","Between a new casino and a push for affordable housing, there’s plenty of interest in developing Chicago.","[""Between a new casino and a push for affordable housing, there’s plenty of interest in developing Chicago.More than 20 projects were added to the Windy City’s development pipeline in the first half of 2022, according to reporting by The Real Deal and other news outlets. Most are residential, a mix of high-end apartment and condominium projects in denser areas and community-focused affordable housing developments. Potential deals total about 16,000 units in the downtown market, said Integra Realty Resources Managing Director Gail Lissner.“Our downtown area has really taken off,” she told The Real Deal. “Neighborhoods like the West Loop didn’t exist in terms of residential before the 1990s,”There’s also big demand for affordable housing, but the problem is figuring out how to pay for it. Some of those projects in the pipeline are part of the city’s $1 billion affordable housing package.Here’s a look at some of the most notable projects.By far the largest development project in terms of both attention and dollars is Bally’s successful $1.74 billion bid to build the city’s first casino. The 30-acre site will also include a hotel, a 3,000-seat theater, an outdoor music venue and other amenities.Lissner said the casino will have a big impact on a neighborhood that was “a little bit more of a sleeper” in terms of residential development and likely spur other commercial development. The plan has so far inspired proposals for high-density high-rise development nearby, which River West hasn’t had before.Shapack Partners, which made its name spearheading the creation of Chicago’s Fulton Market, is now poised to be a major player around the casino. The developer paid $25 million for the Salvation Army’s downtown River West campus and its plans include a 141-key hotel, retail and restaurants on 3.25 acres, Chicago YIMBY reported. The master plan is divided into four parcels across five city blocks. Two designs include four towers and the other has five.Two other Shapack projects proposed this year include a $209 million mixed-use high-rise project at 170 North Green Street in partnership with CRG and adding two floors to its residential project at 1353 West Fulton Street.Also staking its claim to land near the casino is Vancouver, Canada-based Onni Group, which paid $45 million for a seven-acre property near the site. While Onni hasn’t revealed its plans, people familiar with the project said it’s likely to be residential. The site could accommodate as many as 1,000 apartments on 1.5 million square feet.Aiming to curb gentrification in the West Side neighborhood, Humboldt Park Health has proposed building about 300 affordable housing units. The health system broke ground on its new wellness center in June and owns about 60 percent of the land available around it.The real estate team behind the Englewood Square retail development has proposed a mixed-income housing project nearby. Built in two phases, Thrive Englewood will have 108 residential units, 10 of which will be affordable housing.Chicago’s Fern Hill is planning to develop a 34-story condo building in Gold Coast, the city’s epicenter of high end real estate, replacing an existing four story building on the site.One of Chicago’s oldest real estate companies plans to build a nine-story, 129-unit apartment building on the Near North Side on a 14,388-square-foot site. Twenty-six of those apartments will be marked as affordable housing.This joint venture is planning a 21-story apartment building for a corner lot in Streeterville, one block from the Magnificent Mile. The development will have 248 units and also include 41,000 square feet of office space and 8,000 feet of ground-floor retail.A development planned for the heart of Lincoln Square would bring 51 affordable housing units to the neighborhood.This pair of Chicago developers is planning a 362-unit high-rise apartment tower in the West Loop.The Chicago real estate investment firm plans to turn a vacant lot in Ukrainian Village into a five-story retail and apartment development. The building would include 40 units and ground floor retail.This $33 million project would bring a 60-unit affordable housing redevelopment with a ground-floor grocery store to West Humboldt Park.The two local real estate development firms plan to create the Halim A. Flowers Center, which will include transitional housing for the formerly incarcerated, rental apartments and single-family homes. The $28 million project is expected to break ground this fall.This $11 million project planned to convert a 92-year old church in Logan Square into 22 affordable apartments has received $2 million in federal funds and still needs about $7 million more, though it was approved by the Chicago City Council in December 2020.One of Chicago’s oldest nonprofits is planning to step into the affordable housing market with a nine-story structure in the Illinois Medical District. The building, called Foglia Residences, will include 76 apartments reserved for residents making below the area median income, with an emphasis on housing blind and visually impaired residents.A proposed $38 million mixed-income complex in Bronzeville would include 71 units across a complex of eight buildings.The city purchased the largest vacant lot in rapidly gentrifying Pilsen as part of Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s initiatives to revitalize the city’s South and West sides. The plan is to turn the six-acre former industrial site into 280 units of affordable housing, green space and retail spots.In another effort to stave off gentrification in Humboldt Park, this development will offer 64 units of affordable housing and 2,500 square feet of commercial space on a long-vacant lot.The 30-acre development is set to include a new hospital, vocational school, day care, market, affordable housing, restaurants, retail, sports fields, a theater and more.Dubbed 43 Green, this $100 million project will include 99 residential units – 50 of which will be marketed as affordable housing – and more than 5,000 feet of retail space.Two local nonprofits plan to develop the long-vacant Halsted Indoor Mall into a mixed-use complex that will include 250 rental units, 140 single-family homes and up to 20,000 square feet of ground retail space.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",170 North Green Street

Preliminary numbers for June are also strong.“We’re definitely different from what we are seeing nationally in terms of sales declining for four straight months,” the group’s Pete Novak told the outlet. “We are a little ways away from seeing prices decline. We still have a pretty major inventory issue.”Affordability will probably be the biggest challenge for home sales moving forward as demand stays strong, he said.“It’s no surprise the median selling price continues to climb dramatically,” Novak said. “Really, the difference in our market locally versus the national numbers is we are still seeing pretty substantial price increases,” Novak said.While the supply of homes in Indiana is increasing, it’s still limited. Some 1,000 homes were available for sale in May, compared with about 700 a year earlier.Despite signs that the market could slow, there are few signs of a pending crash, according to the group’s Jessica Kish, president of the GNIAR board of directors, who said she doesn’t expect Indiana’s housing market to crash any time soon.“What we will see is a little bit of a cooling off,” Kish told the outlet. “We are seeing things sit just a little bit longer. We are seeing a few price adjustments happening. That is something we have seen for quite some time.”[PT] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Gavin will the private-equity firm’s real estate portfolio as it sells the landmark Wrigley Building, sources told Crain’s, which first reported on his new position.Before joining Sterling Bay in 2011, Gavin spent 14 years running Cushman & Wakefield’s capital markets group.BDT, led by billionaire banker Byron Trott, bought the Wrigley Building and a neighboring lot for $33 million in 2011 and spent $70 million renovating it. It sold the adjacent lot in 2014 for $42 million, and now is poised to sell the two-tower building for $255 million to Morningstar founder Joe Mansueto.The firm primarily invests in private companies for wealthy family business founders, and in recent years has hired away Joe Gutman from GCM Grosvenor and John Dills from GTCR.For Sterling Bay, the Lincoln Yards project is one of several several blockbuster deals. In the past year, it acquired 600 West Chicago Avenue, home of Groupon’s headquarters, for $510 million; and the Prudential Plaza for $680 million.The developer also has been a key investor in the Fulton Market building boom, developing the Google Midwest headquarters at 1000 West Fulton Market, the Fulton West development at 1330 West Fulton Market, the “vendor village” office building at 210 North Carpenter Street near the McDonald’s building and two hotels. It also recently secured a $182 million construction loan for the start of its ambitious plans for the 300 block of North Green Street.

Other tenants include DLA Piper, Mead Johnson Nutrition and Morton Salt.A Hines spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the refinancing, which was provided by AIG, MetLife and a subsidiary of TIAA, according to Cook County records.Hines bought the vacant riverfront property in 2012 for $25.4 million, and the building cost some $500 million to complete, the Chicago Tribune reported in 2016. Montreal-based Ivanhoe Cambridge kicked in $300 million toward the project, with the city pledging $29 million in tax-increment financing money for the development of a 1.5-acre public park on the site.The developers first proposed the project in 2009, but shelved it during the recession when they couldn’t secure financing.Together with Riverside Investment & Development’s office tower across Lake Street at 150 North Riverside Plaza, River Point helped launch a transformation of the area where the branches of the river meet.Hines is building on that across the river at Wolf Point, where it is erecting three soaring towers in a mixed-use project with the Kennedy family.Just south, Riverside and Howard Hughes Corporation are building a 54-story office tower at 110 North Wacker Drive, the former site of GGP’s headquarters.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",444 West Lake Street

It was originally listed at $18.5 million by the tower’s developer, Magellan Development Group. The buyers of the 10,000-square-foot condo are not yet identified in public records.Leila Zammatta of Magellan Realty LLC represented the developer and Rachel Vecchio of Dream Town Realty represented the buyers.

Located at 363 East Wacker Drive, it is the city’s third tallest building. The building’s chief architect is Jeanne Gang, head of Studio Gang Architects.Several other major sales should be coming to the tower soon, but none as high-priced as this sale. The tower’s agents have 11 units labeled as “pending” on public listing sites, including two units over $10 million. In late February, a unit on the 80th-floor went for nearly $8.85 million, a record in the building at the time. A three bedroom, three-bathroom unit was sold for $2.9 million just days after the $8.9 million sale.Prior to this deal, the highest priced sale in the city was an 89th-floor penthouse at Chicago’s Trump International & Tower, sold for $20 million in the city’s second-priciest condo deal ever.The Trump Tower condo was owned by Sanjay Shay, CEO of Hoffman Estates-based software maker Vistex. It sold March 7 after going under contract in mid-February. Shay bought the 14,260-square-foot full-floor penthouse for $17 million in 2014 and listed the unit for $30 million in September.The buyer’s purchase price is the second-highest that anyone has paid for a single Chicago-area property. Citadel Chief Executive Officer Ken Griffin bought four condo units for more than $58 million in the building at 9 West Walton Street in Gold Coast in 2017, in four separate transactions. Only one of his transactions was priced for more than $20 million.The Trump Tower deal is also the latest example of high-end properties in the Chicago area moving at a record pace, despite rising interest rates thwarting buyers in other segments of the market.

After the city approved the plan in 2016, workers razed a decades-old bank building on the site and dug a foundation, but the project stalled when the property owner struggled to find tenants.Since summer 2016, the site has remained a block-sized crater hemmed by chain-link fences.While looking forward to the project, area property owners and renters are wary of another fake-out, according to Tim Ryan, president and managing broker of Monarch Realty Corp., who bears no relation to Ryan Companies.“We’re all kind of waiting to see whether it can be can be done,” said Ryan, who lives in Portage Park and sits on the Six Corners Association’s economic vitality committee.“We always want to know is whether they have the financing in place to begin at least the first couple phases of the project, and whether they have a clear path going forward. No one wants to see a developer walk away from a half-built shell because the winds of the economy have changed.”Once one of Chicago’s busiest retail districts, the Six Corners area suffered a steep decline starting in the 1970s, and this month’s closure of the city’s last Sears outlet at 4720 West Irving Park throws the neighborhood even deeper into flux.But the district’s retail strength has also resurged post-recession, as an influx of young professionals has sent new demand cascading up the city’s northwest side Blue Line corridor.Since 2014, 45 new businesses have opened inside the district’s officially-marked boundaries, according to Kelli Wefenstette, director of the Six Corners Association. And Ryan said retail vacancies within a mile radius of the intersection have roughly halved since 2015.That trend can only accelerate if the Point is seen through to completion, Ryan said.Six Corners “is so far west that it’s been off the map for a while, but we’re seeing a lot of commercial opportunities now that are supported by this growing residential base,” Ryan said. “And if you have elderly people moving in, then their families are going to visit, and inevitably, they’re going to be spending their money somewhere.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","15 a.m., June 21: Clark Street"

The property includes 320 units across 32 buildings at 31 Olympic Drive. It was Silver Street’s only property in the Chicago area.Though public records show the purchase was finalized earlier this month, its financing has been in the works for longer. The City of Chicago Heights signed off on the issuance of revenue bonds to provide up to $25 million to finance an acquisition and improvements to the property in 2019.An attorney for National Preservation Housing Partners told the City Council at the time that the organization planned to purchase the apartment complex with a $28 million loan from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as well as a $22 million tax-exempt bond issue, minutes from the council’s January 2019 meeting show.The Olympic Village purchase rounds out National Preservation Housing Partners’ portfolio in the Chicago area to 700 units. The company also owns properties elsewhere in Illinois as well as in Arizona, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland and Pennsylvania and has preserved approximately 4,000 units in total.The company sold off four properties totaling 755 units in the Chicago area in fall 2018, including Maple Point Apartments in Gold Coast for $53 million, Centennial Apartments in suburban Mount Prospect for $30.2 million and Walsh Park Apartments in Bucktown for $35.3 million. All three of those properties were sold to affordable housing landlord Standard Companies, which recently paid about $43 million for a South Side apartment complex from the Chicago Housing Authority.Another affordable housing provider, New York’s Jonathan Rose Cos., recently poured $63 million into the acquisition and redevelopment of an affordable housing complex on Chicago’s Near West Side, Barbara Jean Wright Court.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",32 buildings at 31 Olympic Drive

Closed sales dropped 14 percent to 1,045 in 2022 from a year earlier..Novak said the Northwest Indiana market, which was outpacing the national average as recently as May, is starting to balance out due to higher interest rates and rising prices.Last year “was kind of historic, to be honest with you,” Novak told the outlet. “Things are certainly less heated than then, but we are still a desirable and heated market.”Northwest Indiana has less than a month-and-a-half supply of homes available for sale, compared with six to seven months in a balanced market. “It is still by far a sellers’ market,” Novak said.While sales are down from 2021, prices are still rising and buyers are still willing to compete for properties. While some sellers are accepting prices below the asking price, that can also be common in normal markets. Median home prices rose almost 10 percent in June to $247,000 from a year earlier.“What we haven’t seen is a decrease in pricing,” Novak told the outlet. “At some point that will happen.

That average is the highest of three condo developments now in development, which include the St. Regis and Tribune Tower.One Chicago is across the street from a McDonald’s where the violence erupted last month. JDL says it isn’t worried about the potential fallout.“It was isolated to their location and didn’t impact our building,” said JDL Principal Jim Letchinger. “We’re obviously disappointed, and we’ve been diligent [in working with the Chicago Police Department.] It’s on every street. It’s a city issue. It’s an every-city issue.”St. Regis is averaging about $1,034 a square foot, according to Crain’s. While there’s less recent data on prices at Tribune Tower, an agent for the tower previously said prices were averaging $1,050 a square foot.\nBuyers who are receiving their units now have probably had them under contract for months, long before the shooting across the street, although they could still cancel. Four closed on May 31 and another 17 are marked as pending sales on real estate sites.The most expensive units, a $28 million two-story penthouse and several $10 million ones that cover a full floor of the building, don’t have buyers.One Chicago has 77 condos on the top 30 floors of the 75-story building.

It exceeded the $3.95 million sale in 2013 for the former home of the founder of the Adler Planetarium.The Woodlawn Avenue mansion was listed in March 2020 at $4.75 million.

The home has a broad stone fireplace flanked by wood bookcases, leaded glass windows and a wood bench built into the base of the windows.The sale of the Woodlawn Avenue house brings the tally of homes sold for $4 million or more to 101 over the past 12 months, doubling the average in the previous six years of 52 sales.

The firm has been a tenant in the Railway Exchange Building for 28 years and leases floors 5, 9 and 10.“Staying in our current location and optimizing our workplace was the best outcome for us,” Stein said in the statement.The Railway Exchange Building was built in 1904 by famed architect Daniel Burnham, who also had an office in the building. It is on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2015, the University of Notre Dame endowment bought out Hamilton Partners’ minority stake in the building, after the joint venture bought the building in 2006 for $53 million, Crain’s previously reported.SOM has designed some of the tallest and most notable buildings in the world, including Chicago’s Willis Tower, New York’s One World Trade Center and Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building.In Chicago, SOM is working on the $1 billion redevelopment of the old Cook County Hospital campus. The firm is also designing Thor Equities’ planned office building in Fulton Market and Related Midwest’s library and affordable-housing complex in University Village.Savills’ Robert Sevim, Eric Feinberg and Joe Learner represented SOM in the lease renewal.

11:28 AM","The building formerly known as Merchandise Mart, once the hotspot for tech companies in Chicago, needs another renovation as it faces new competition.","[""Merchandise MART and Vornado VP Glen Weiss (Loopnet, LinkedIn)The building formerly known as Merchandise Mart, once the hotspot for tech companies in Chicago, needs another renovation as it faces new competition.Just six years after owner Vornado dropped $40 million on theMART, a sprawling River North property, it’s spending another $60 million to keep up with new developments and attract tenants amid the pandemic, according to Crain’s.Most of the renovations will occur on the first two floors of the 3.7-million-square-foot building. Brokers representing tenants say those areas need more amenities than the marble staircase and food hall Vornado added in 2016, according to Crain’s.This time, Vornado plans to add a 27,000-square-foot amenity and conferencing space, a so-called speakeasy lounge and a 23,500-square-foot fitness center, the building’s second gym, on the second floor, according to a presentation from building leasing agency Stream Realty Partners obtained by Crain’s. The changes will be made to the entrance at the corner of Kinzie and Wells streets and the main south lobby. Plans for exterior renovations call for landscaped greenspace along the Chicago River.Vornado declined to confirm the cost of the renovation but plans on beginning work this year with an estimated 12-18 month timeframe until completion.Vornado Executive Vice President Glen Weiss said the trend towards work from home means office spaces need to be more enticing than they were pre-pandemic.“It’s ‘I have to be in a building where my employees want to come to get off the couch and come back,’ ” Weiss told Crain’s.The project’s success could serve as a litmus test for what downtown buildings need to compete with Fulton Market and other places that have added to their leases during the pandemic, according to Crain’s.At theMART, the occupancy rate is more than 89 percent, nine points above the average for downtown buildings. It also recently renewed its lease with 1871 and added Medline Industries to a 12-year lease for 51,000-square-feet.But occupancy at theMART is at its lowest since at least 2007 and its operating income is down 18 percent year-over-year. It also lost tenants like CNC Intelligent Solutions, which left its 125,000-square-foot lease for a new office in the Fulton Market District. Publicis Groupe left a similarly sized space and PayPal, Yelp and VelocityEHS have all listed some of their space for subleasing.Meanwhile, many believe Fulton Market has become the premiere destination in Chicago, with Google and McDonald’s opting for office space there over theMART.“There was a time period where the MART stood alone in many respects, and there was a mystique about the building,” John Dempsey, who helped lead theMART’s leasing team for nearly 25 years and is now principal of Vanderbilt Office Properties, told Crain’s. “Now that mystique has been captured by many others, so how do you go back and separate yourself from the crowd?”\nRead more\n\n\n\nWhat tenants are paying at theMART\nMerchandise Mart gets digital canvas\nJohn Deere signs Fulton Market leaseAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

They listed eight demands to city leaders and Sterling Bay, including that they slow down the planning process and include more local business owners in discussions over the venue plans.“Six venues in that space is going to change the music culture in this city substantially … and our message is that we need a thorough and transparent process to talk about it,” said Robert Gomez, owner of the Subterranean nightclub and co-chair of the venue owners’ group. “It’s time to stop with the closed-door meetings.”The owners of The Hideout, a century-old music venue at the doorstep of the planned Lincoln Yards site, have rallied neighbors to challenge the city’s efforts to create a new tax increment financing district that would fund public infrastructure work around the development.Alderman Brian Hopkins (2nd) vowed this month to designate The Hideout as a historic landmark, and Sterling Bay managing principal Andy Gloor said Thursday his company has no intention of buying the land underneath the bar. In August, the developer bought two other properties on the same block as The Hideout.Owners of well-known Chicago music venues like The Empty Bottle, The Whistler, Metro, Promontory and Thalia Hall also have joined the coalition.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The latest version was approved on June 21.No mortgage appears to have been issued on the property since the Sept. 17 sale, according to Cook County property records.The site barely falls inside the Near North Affordable Requirements Ordinance pilot zone established by the City Council in November, meaning any new plan would trigger a mandate for the developer to make at least 20 percent of its units affordable.The application approved in June calls for 10 affordable units — the minimum number required under the city’s 2015 Affordable Requirements Ordinance — to be included on-site.The city’s buildings department has not issued permits for the property, according to city records.The new tower would rise across the street from the 496-unit K2 apartment complex, which was completed in 2013 by Fifield Companies and is now managed by Lincoln Property Company.Vancouver-based Onni Group also wants to build a 356-unit residential tower at 353 West Grand Avenue in River North. Alderman Brendan Reilly (42nd) appeared to endorse the proposal in his newsletter last week, adding it’s set to go before the plan commission next month.Onni has also signaled interest in buying a 190,000-square-foot property at 901 North Halsted Street, at the southern tip of Goose Island.A spokesman for Onni did not respond to multiple requests for comment Wednesday.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",352 North Union Avenue

The Wards say they’re owed nearly $2 million as well as punitive damages.Eckhardt didn’t comment, but Gramenos repeated her claim that Eckhardt was the licensed developer and contractor on the projects and Gramenos merely did design work. “The projects did not deliver the financial results that everyone was hoping for,” her lawyer Daniel Lynch said, adding that she also lost a lot of money on the projects and has not been able to obtain key documents from Eckhardt.The show’s second season is expected to premiere this month.

The seller was a venture led by developer Paul Gearen.The now-vacant six-story building had until recently been fully occupied by financial services company Northern Trust. It vacated the space at the end of its lease to consolidate operations into a new location at 333 South Wabash Avenue.To redevelop the 2.5 million-square-foot Old Post Office, 601W spent $800 million and inked big leases with tenants like Uber, Walgreens and Ferrara Candy.But now is a difficult time for the office market. Across the U.S., office vacancy has been rising, and Chicago is no exception. But Matt Whipple of Telos Group, which is marketing 801 South Canal, said 601W is betting that a property redesigned for the post-pandemic world will attract tenants, Crain’s reported. The new building will be named Canal Station.601W is also renovating an office tower at 1 South Wacker Drive as well as the Aon Center, where the firm is spending $185 million in upgrades.In New York, 601W has reportedly struck a deal with SL Green Realty to purchase the Amazon-anchored property at 410 10th Avenue for $952.5 million.

12:22 PM","Tishman Speyer’s Fulton Market property, already sizzling, will soon get steaks on plates.","[""Michael and Bryan Voltaggio; 320 North Sangamon St., Chicago (320 North Sangamon, Regalis)Tishman Speyer’s Fulton Market property, already sizzling, will soon get steaks on plates.The New York developer’s 13-story, 270,000 square foot office building at 320 North Sangamon Street will be home to an Italian steakhouse with an 8,200-square-foot main dining room in ground level retail space opened by DineAmic Hospitality, Crain’s reported. Michelin-starred “Top Chef” victor Michael Voltaggio and his brother Bryan, who has also been a contestant on the cooking show, will be the culinary heads of the restaurant, called Fioretta, or “little flower” in Italian.The restaurant group’s commitment to the property, which was co-developed by Chicago’s Mark Goodman & Associates, adds another tenant to an already strong tenant roster.The building filled out amid a pandemic that depleted office demand elsewhere in Chicago and in downtowns across the nation, hitting 87 percent leased after venture capital firm Valor Equity Partners this month said it would take 24,000 square feet, exiting the former John Hancock Center on the Mag Mile. Other firms that signed on during the health crisis include Hazel Technologies across 50,000 square feet as well as real estate tech company VTS, which leased 36,000.Fulton Market was the only area in Chicago to experience positive office space absorption in 2021. Tishman and Goodman just scored a $26.1 million loan on the property from Wells Fargo, a sign of its strong performance and ability to carry more debt after obtaining an $81.4 million construction loan in 2019.The restaurant will be the Voltaggios’ first in Chicago. Its will add to high-end steakhouse options in the West Loop, including the nearby Swift & Sons at 1000 West Fulton Market Street.

01:52 PM","Every Chicago developer, big or small, wants a piece of Fulton Market, the once gritty area where Class A office buildings, boutique hotels and new apartment projects have defied the pandemic that battered commercial real estate.","[""Fulton St. Companies’ Alex Najem (iStock)Every Chicago developer, big or small, wants a piece of Fulton Market, the once gritty area where Class A office buildings, boutique hotels and new apartment projects have defied the pandemic that battered commercial real estate.Fulton Street Companies – the largest smaller developer in the neighborhood, as CEO Alex Najem calls it – has nine projects that are either completed, under construction or proposed in Fulton Market. That’s nowhere close to the scale of the bigger developers Najem is up against, including Sterling Bay, whose dozen or so Fulton Market projects total more than 4.4 million square feet and Shapack Partners, developer of 10 planned projects and two hotels totalling at least 2.5 million square feet in the district.For Najem, the key is focus – not just Fulton Market, but in its most sought-after locations. After all, it’s right there in his company’s name.“Are you really in Fulton Market, if you’re not on Fulton Market (street)?” asked Matt Pistorio, founder of Chicago commercial real estate agency Madison Rose, which manages FSC’s leasing at 1045 West Fulton Market. “It’s a running joke we have, but, if you’re located at Fulton Market (street), that’s a premier address like Wacker Drive.”Unlike other Chicago developers that spread their bets across the city, Najem narrowed his focus. His strategy has been a success so far, even though he jumped into the Fulton Market race in 2017, years after the pioneers such as Sterling Bay and Shapack Partners.About 12 years ago, Najem was representing tenants looking for restaurants and retail spaces as a broker for the development firm Cedar Street. He got his first taste of Fulton Market in 2014 when he led Cedar to buy and later sell four loft buildings. Eight years later, Najem’s company bought those same buildings for $33 million. Of the nine planned sites and completed projects on his firm’s website, seven have Fulton Market addresses.“I had to build my own reputation and the only way to really win for me was to have the best locations, the best architecture, and the most flexibility,” Najem said in an interview. “If I could build the same product as somebody else but I had a better location I would always win the tenant.”Born in Texas, Najem grew up mostly in Indianapolis, frequently visiting Chicago. He started his career as a trader at the Chicago Board of Trade in 2006 and pivoted to real estate four years later.Najem’s love for restaurants and experience in helping his uncle in the hospitality business prepared him to understand what tenants want and build his network.In December 2017, he partnered with longtime friend Ross Babel, a residential developer focused on ground-up development across Chicago. While their business started from buying a three-story fire station on 114 North Aberdeen and leasing it out to two tenants, FSC had plans for bigger ground-up projects based on Babel’s expertise in getting project permits and Najem’s ability to raise money and buy properties.The redevelopment of a dilapidated 15,000-square-foot meatpacking facility at 1100 West Fulton Market put FSC on the map. It created a 45,000-square-foot, three- and five-story showroom, retail, and office space, with large loft-style windows on the ground level, metal awnings, and a rooftop terrace for furniture brand Herman Miller, the single tenant.1100 West Fulton (FultonSt.com)While companies tried to find buildings with large floor plates before the pandemic to fit employees into a single floor, Najem “saw the expectation that people would rather control everything in the building, the aesthetics, the roof deck, and the way people entered and exited the building,” said Jim Plunkard, partner and co-founder of Chicago architecture firm Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture that worked with FSC on the 1100 West Fulton Market project.“It gave him a lot of feedback to stay in this district and to grow in this district,” said Plunkard recalling when FSC signed Herman Miller for a 15-year lease. “Najem was ahead of the trend.”As commercial property sales plummet and firms adapt to remote work, Najem’s strategy created a windfall. The building generated “an exceptional amount of interest and bidding activity” and sold at a record $925 per square foot in December, said Cody Hundertmark, at Cushman & Wakefield, who represented FSC in the $41.75 million sale to Australian Zagame Corporation.Over the past two years, he bought about four acres in Fulton Market and completed a 160,000-square-foot Class A building at 1045 West Fulton Market that’s ready for tenant move-in.“Right when the pandemic hit, they [Fulton Street Companies] decided to launch a project at 1045 West Fulton Market,” said Madison Rose’s Pistorio, who is in charge of leasing at the building. “In a way Alex was kind of gambling, even when the pandemic started, because he knew it was going to take off.”By now, there is “enough interest to lease the entire building,” Najem said of the 1045 West Fulton Market property. “The amount of interest over the last month has been more than I’ve ever experienced in my time in Fulton Market.”1045 West Fulton (FultonSt.com)While FSC’s successful redevelopment helped create a buzz in the neighborhood, Sterling Bay and Shapack Partners are catching up.Sterling Bay has at least eight residential and commercial projects totaling about 3 million square feet either under construction, approved, or proposed in the district, according to local commercial developer SVN Chicago. At a price tag of more than $105 million, Sterling Bay also plans to buy a vacant 2.7-acre site running along the west side of Peoria Street and Metra tracks, the largest remaining development site in the Fulton Market District.Shapack Partners is aiming to build a 28-story residential building at 1353 West Fulton Street and a commercial building at 170 North Green Street with 275 apartments, office space, and 150 hotel rooms. It’s also seeking approval from the City Council to demolish the longtime Bridgford Foods processing plant across the street from 167 North Green Street and develop a 40-story mixed-use project.Najem says the firms’ aggressive expansion will help keep the neighborhood densely populated. He saw the lifting of the ban on residential development in Fulton Market in 2020 as another chance to make the district that much more sought-after.Fulton Market Street is the “real walkable street that’ll draw retail, restaurants after the pandemic,” said HPA’s Plunakard. Adding new residential projects to the scene, Plunkard said the area is going to feed on itself when more retailers want to come in – more good news for FSC.“It’s the best of both worlds because the ban on residential north of Lake Street forced a lot of commercial development,” Najem said. FSC wants to build 1.1 million square feet of residential and office buildings around the 1200 block of West Fulton Street and a 430-unit apartment building on 1325 Randolph Street.Projects lined up to break ground potentially in May are a 39,000-square-foot, 433-unit project at 1201 West Fulton Market and a 530,000-square-foot Class A office and retail building at 917 West Fulton Market. Najem’s first luxury condo development, where he plans to move in upon completion, at the 10-story, 25-unit condominium at 1010 West Madison, will also break ground this year.1201 West Fulton (FultonSt.com)Najem still sees opportunities to buy properties and expand his portfolio, with his latest purchase being four loft buildings on 1144 West Fulton, 112 North May, 1101 West Fulton, and 220 North Aberdeen for more than $30 million.“I walk there every single day, I see every single project,” said Najem. “I don’t focus on any other parts of the city or anywhere else in the country. I solely focus on Fulton Market and that’s it.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","105 million, St"

Farther north, Sterling Bay is transforming a large swath of riverfront property into the Lincoln Yards mega-development, while just to the southeast Tribune Media is planning its own major project called the “River District.”And in the shadow of the new Lyft site, developers including Onni Group are eyeing potential new uses for the heavily industrial Goose Island.

The lender was KKR Real Estate Finance Trust, records indicate.The refinancing comes after CIM renovated the nearly 1-million-square-foot Financial District building. Renovations included improvements to the building’s public plaza, new lounge areas and a new lobby that was relocated from LaSalle Street to Financial Street, hence the rebranding to 425 South Financial Place. Renovations were completed in 2018, CIM said in a press release. Interior renovations were completed by its previous owner in 2015.CIM bought the building in 2016 for $189 milion and financed the deal with a $131 million loan from JP Morgan Chase. Last summer, CIM inked Chicago Trading to a 27,000-square-foot lease expansion in the tower.Built in 1984, 425 South Financial Place includes a 950,000-square-foot office tower and an 83,000-square-foot annex and a 45,000-square-foot outdoor plaza.CIM is involved in a number of high-profile development projects in Chicago. The firm in November secured a $328 million construction loan from JP Morgan Chase for its redevelopment of the Tribune Tower, a project with Golub & Company. Plans for the project include a mixed-use tower that would be the city’s second-tallest building.CIM and Golub are also teaming up to build a 32-unit condo building in Old Town. The firm is also looking to offload its luxury apartment tower atop the Block 37 mall in the Loop.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",425 South Financial Place

Bansal at 1887 Cooper Lane, which is advertised on Airbnb as a “beautiful mansion near O’Hare and Chicago” that can accommodate 15 guests. It rents for $690 to $773 a night.Bansal began offering short-term rentals at the home after moving out of state, and neighbors say it’s frequently the site of big parties.Cooper said a teenager’s birthday party last year drew 300 people and had to be shut down by police. Sometimes, he added, “when the wind comes from the west, one can smell the dope being smoked.”While the Highland Park City Council last year declined to prohibit short-term rentals, it imposed a rule in the Cooper Lane neighborhood requiring all leases to be a minimum of a year.But neighbors said the home continued to be used as a short-term rental.Bansal and his daughter Rania, who is listed as the host on Airbnb, declined comment to the Highland Park News, as did their attorney. But guests of the home continue to post positive reviews about it online — even as recently as last month.Residents of another upscale neighborhood — Chicago’s Gold Coast — faced a similar dilemma with two houses, but pressure from the neighbors and two aldermen led the owners to list the properties for sale.Chicago requires all short-term-rental hosts to register with the city, and allows neighborhoods to ban them via petition.

CBRE, which was the broker at that time, valued the building at around $15 million. The land it stands on, meanwhile, was estimated to be worth more than the building, due to its prime location.The property housed one of Chicago’s oldest private clubs before closing in May of last year. The club, which was founded in 1869 by the city’s Jewish community, faced declining membership and mounting debt and had previously said it hopes to continue in a new location.According to a previous report from Crain’s, the building is in bad shape and the club can’t afford to pay for a renovation.The Standard Club declined to provide any information on the listing. Colliers’ Tyler Hague, one of the brokers handling the sale of the building, also declined to comment, only saying that they received the assignment sometime during the past month.

The couple bought the home on Lansdowne Lane for $2.75 million, less than half of what they are planning to sell it for.Nagy, named head coach of the Bears in January 2018, was fired in January following a dismal record of 34 wins and 31 losses in four seasons. He will be returning to the Kansas City Chiefs as quarterbacks coach.The home, built in 2017, features a home gym, outdoor fire pit, and a Bears-themed basketball court painted orange and blue with a Bears logo on the padding under the hoop. When the house was for sale in 2018, a listing from Premier Realty Group said the house had Amish-built cabinetry, a media room, a bar in the basement, and a rear patio facing Lake Michigan, according to the publication.Co-host of the Bear Down podcast Brendan Sugrue wrote about a “coming soon” listing from Compass for Nagy’s mansion on Twitter on March 5, but was taken down from the brokerage’s website with a “temporarily off market” label the next day. The listing remains actively listed in the private network.Lake Bluff is also home to Chicago Bears quarterback Andy Dalton, who signed a one-year $10 million contract with the team last year. Dalton and his wife, Jordan, bought a five-bedroom, 5,300-square-foot home for $2.48 million in an off-market deal after it initially was listed for $2.595 million.Chicago’s luxury residential market had a record year in 2021, with more than 100 homes sold for $4 million or more, double the average of 51.5 over the past six years.

Legislators also approved a ballot measure that would raise income taxes on residents who earn more than $250,000 and created a “task force” to explore ways to bring down property taxes.The changes come amid Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s pledge to take a tougher stance on the real estate industry, and Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi’s vow to make commercial real estate heavyweights shoulder a heavier share for the county’s tax burden.Goode tried to tamp down fears that Kaegi’s new math will blow up the market for commercial and industrial operators, after some north-suburban property owners saw their assessments more than double this spring.“He’s an elected official, and politicians in all these communities are going to be very upset if all of a sudden he doubles their taxes,” Goode said. “We’re in the first few months of a process … and he can always adjust it back down.”Political obstacles and the shrinking availability of wide-open properties in Chicago have driven industrial developers to cities like Louisville, Nashville and Columbus, Ohio, where warehouse construction has spiked dramatically in the last several years, panelists said.Those smaller cities have seen a “much larger demand” for large-scale new construction and warehouses suited to unique tenants, while smaller in-fill sites are Chicago’s “bread and butter,” said Jim McGill, who leads the nascent industrial division of CA Ventures.But the Chicago area is one of the only regions with enough “human resources” to satisfy companies’ voracious demand for employees in a drum-tight national labor market, according to James Martell, CEO of the Chicago-based Logistics Property Company.“You may see some yield benefits looking at other markets, but Chicago is still the industrial hub of the Midwest,” Martell said. “Everything has to flow through here at some point, so with all of the political issues, there’s still going to be a demand for industrial real estate driven by logistics activity.”Logistics Property Company announced plans this year for a 900,000-square-foot shipping campus in south-suburban Country Club Hills and a 137,000-square-foot “last-mile” facility in McKinley Park on the Near South Side, set to join the more than 17 million square feet it’s already built around the country.It’s among a multitude of developers and other investors cashing in on the region’s 6.3 percent industrial vacancy rate, an 18-year low.This week, New York-based investment giant Blackstone made an eye-popping $19 billion bet on the industrial sector with its purchase of a nationwide warehouse portfolio from Singapore-based GLP Pte.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Class A gross asking rent rose just 0.4 percent in the first quarter, for an average of $44.72. Overall Downtown asking rent rose by 1.4 percent, from $39.36 to $39.91.The slowdown comes as a number of large projects are set to deliver, including the 1.3-million-square-foot tower at 110 North Wacker that will be anchored by Bank of America and the 2.8-million-square-foot Old Main Post office, which has been pitched as a possible home to Amazon’s second headquarters.That doesn’t include ambitious plans along the North and South branches of the Chicago River and the ongoing boom in Fulton Market, Feinberg said.“Every day there seems like a new one being announced or planned in Fulton Market,” he said.“Unless Chicago lands Amazon,\xa0 it remains to be seen whether current demand is sustainable as more than 7 million square feet delivers downtown in the next three years,” Feinberg said, referring to the e-commerce giant’s second headquarters.Put that in perspective of rising interest rates and a declining employment outlook and that could mean downward pressure on rents, Feinberg said.“That’s going to be very good for tenants and not so good for landlords,” he said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Full campaign finance reports for the quarter are due Oct. 15, though candidate committees file standalone reports for larger contributions.Marcus didn’t return a request for comment. He also donated to President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign for the White House.Tying Marcus’ contribution was Richard Melman, the founder and chairman of Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises, a restaurant company that owns, manages and licenses more than 60 brands and 130 restaurants across the nation, including dozens of Chicago locations.Residential players have jumped behind the Lightfoot campaign, too. A contribution of $2,500 came from John Vanderlinden, a broker with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices who’s marketing multiple high-end Gold Coast condos and a suburban development site in Glencoe, all of them for upwards of $4 million, including one $7.3 million condo listing.Lightfoot’s campaign also received a boost from parties in the development sector. Matthew Snyder, a manager at Marmon Group, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary with real estate business lines, contributed $1,000, as did engineering firm Princeton Technical Services, which specializes in complex construction.On the finance side, Lightfoot got $15,000 from Gordon Segal, managing director at Prairie Management Group, an investment firm that seeks real estate opportunities.Outside of Illinois, Lightfoot roped in at least $9,000 from Texas real estate interests since the spring. She visited the state in May, a trip that included meetings with business leaders and venture capitalists in Dallas and Austin, though it’s not clear if the donations were tied to those meetings.Texas Central, the company building a new high-speed rail line in the Lone Star state, contributed $2,500. Lightfoot also received $2,000 from Houston-based construction company JDDA Group, $1,500 from BecTec Construction Resources and $1,000 apiece from Houston’s Ride Development, a group of insulation manufacturing and investment companies called Hart Group and a Dallas-based executive at 1547 Critical Systems Realty, which specializes in developing data centers. The Chicago area has attracted multiple data center projects by the likes of Microsoft, Prime Data Centers and other companies, some of which have been built or planned with $1 billion price tags.Lightfoot faces a crowded field in the February election. Announced candidates include State Rep. Kam Buckner, law enforcement officer Frederick Collins, Alderman Ray Lopez, Alderman Sophia King, Alderman Roderick Sawyer, former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and businessman and philanthropist Willie Wilson, among others.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The suit was filed in Cook County Court earlier this year, but moved to federal court last month.The investors include those from Illinois, Indiana, Argentina and Canada, Crain’s reported. Related is not a party to the suit.\nRelated’s 62-acre development will include 1.5 million square feet of office space, thousands of residential units and 100,000 square feet of retail, hospitality and restaurant space.The investors claim a 2007 deal they struck with Rezko, who had been a partner with GMH, stipulated it would receive future profits, according to Crain’s. Rezko, who was a fundraiser for former governor and ex-con Rod Blagojevich, was convicted on corruption charges and spent time in federal prison. He sold his interest in The 78 project to a GMH subsidiary in 2007.GMH has previously said it dissolved the company Rezko had formed, which comprised his holdings in The 78. The investors were minority partners in that company, according to Crain’s.GMH is also fighting another lawsuit from a different group of investors, which is now being heard by an arbitrator, according to the report.

Its first condo residents did not move in until summer 2017, according to Crain’s.The 3-acre site at 540 West Webster Avenue had been home to the 125-year-old Lincoln Park Hospital until the facility closed in 2008. Sandz, led by co-founder Richard Zisook, bought the property a year later and demolished the building, proposing 95 condos and 75 apartments in its place.Sandz also built the condo high-rises at 530 and 600 North Lake Shore Drive in Streeterville, plus the Dickens Court Townhomes and Eugenie Terrace Townhomes in Lincoln Park, according to its website.Solomon Cordwell Buenz designed a number of high-profile projects locally, and is the architect for CIM and Golub & Company’s condo redevelopment of the Tribune Tower, as well as CA Ventures’ nearly-completed South Loop apartment tower at 1140 South Wabash Avenue.A spokesperson for the architecture firm declined to comment on the suit Wednesday.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",540 West Webster Avenue

Peacock rendering of its mansion at Oakbrook Center opening fall 2022 with Steven and Qi Holtzman (CD Peacock)C.D. Peacock plans to open what it’s calling one of the nation’s largest watch and jewelry stores in the Chicago suburbs this fall.The luxury jeweler will expand its flagship location at the Oakbrook Center mall into a 20,000-square-foot “mansion,” complete with a lounge, restaurant and VIP rooms, the Chicago Business Journal reported.“The investment in our flagship mansion at Oakbrook Center — where 20 million visitors annually spend over 1 billion dollars — is a natural choice as consumer lifestyles and spending shift to the suburbs,” said C.D. Peacock vice chairman Steven Holtzman in a statement. “Open space, eclectic restaurant offerings and ample free parking combine to provide the perfect backdrop for our new location, which will redefine the way consumers shop for luxury.”The retailer, which specializes in luxury jewelry and watches from brands such as Cartier, Rolex and Mikimoto, operates two other locations, at the Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg and the Old Orchard Mall in Skokie.As C.D. Peacock leans into the suburban retail market, other parts of Chicago’s shopping scene are experiencing a revival as well, as Covid cases continue to fall from a winter peak.Retailers are heading into Bucktown and Wicker Park, in part because of elevated rents in the trendier West Loop neighborhood, and commercial property investors have taken notice of a drop in vacancies.“The investment sales market is as hot as I’ve ever seen it,” Marcus & Millichap’s vice president of investments, Mitchell Kiven, told The Real Deal this week. “It’s incredibly active right now, everything is getting multiple offers.”Net rents in those neighborhoods top out at $70 per square foot, as opposed to closer to $100 in the West Loop, according to Chris Irwin, vice president of retail sales at Collier’s. Landlords are also offering more flexible lease teams instead of requiring five-year minimums.In suburban Oak Brook, retail rents are also expected to fetch $70 to $75 per square foot a year, exclusive of property taxes, Paul Bryant, an agent with Chicago-based Mid-America Real Estate, told TRD on Friday.Mid-America has a multi-tenant retail building set for construction just east of Oakbrook Center, and Bryant said he expects to fetch those rates.“In this situation, I think we’ll get it.

About 100 people turned up for a one-hour open house at a new 11-unit condo building in Lakeview, John Grafft of Compass told the outlet. Another Coldwell agent, Anthony Rodriguez, took a client to an Albany Park house on the market for just two days, only to find a full schedule of back-to-back showings.“It’s crazy out there,” Dubray told Crain’s. The third open house “is probably only a day behind” the other two.As the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates again, making mortgages more expensive, many buyers are shopping for homes even before sellers are ready. About 4,100 homes came on the market in Chicago in the first week of 2022, just shy of the 5,350 available in 2021’s first week.A survey by Compass shows that after steep declines in the inventory of homes available in 2020 and 2021, 44 percent of agents expect supply to improve. Yet many say 2022 will still favor sellers over buyers.“You have to pounce when a good new listing comes on the market,” Brian Pistorius of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices told Crain’s. About 37 families came to his weekend open houses in Logan Square, he said. “In this weather, we’d usually be lucky to get five or six.”[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1249 S Christiana Ave

The developer has had recent success with several projects, most notably ultra-luxury condo tower No. 9 Walton.The bible college put its land up for sale last summer, and the offering drew a high volume of interest because of its proximity to Downtown. At the time, The Real Deal reported that a buyer could eventually build up to 5.3 million square feet of new apartments, office, retail or hotels by transferring unused zoning density from the school’s remaining buildings.If the deal moves forward and JDL wins approvals from the city, it could build 2,500 or more apartments and condos throughout several buildings on the site.Down the street from the Moody’s campus, JDL is building One Chicago Square, which will feature 795 luxury apartments, 75 condos and 50,000 square feet of office space between two buildings. The developer bought the site from the Archdiocese of Chicago for about $115 million in 2017.JDL made a splash with No. 9 Walton, in which it has amassed $377 million in sales, according to a recent Tribune analysis.

Others said that aldermen who support the project could be voted out of office.“If you make a mistake tonight, some of you will live to regret (it),” NIMBY resident Oswald Nelson said at the meeting.At the same meeting, council members held a second vote that tentatively approved selling the city-owned lot to Compasspoint for the project.

Adams St. is part of a CMBS loan, and the special servicing move may also be an indication the mortgage terms need to be restructured to avoid default.According to the report, the hotel owner — a unit of Florida-based real estate firm Estein USA — was late on its May debt service payment. The company now contends it has made that payment. The loan was transferred to Rialto Capital Management for special servicing, the report noted.Illinois is one of the last states that has remained essentially locked down amid the pandemic, and in Chicago, overall hotel occupancy rates were at 24 percent, according to the latest numbers from hospitality research firm STR.The desperation in Estein COO Lance Fair’s words were apparent when discussing the situation. “We need the mayor to open the city back up and get the city back open for business,” Fair said, according to Crain’s.Nationwide, U.S. hotel occupancy rates have plummeted — although they are slowly rising as states reopen for business in stages — and the commercial mortgage-backed securities market has seized up. Billions in hotel loans have been sent to special servicing.Locally, Thor Equities skipped its April loan payment on the $427 million refinance it took out on the 1,600-key Palmer House Hilton. Thor bought the Palmer House for $230 million in 2005, and finished a $131 million renovation in 2008.

A sale at that price would work out to more than $500,000 per unit at the 15-story complex, at 1407 S. Michigan Avenue.In River North, UBS Realty Investors has listed the 171-unit building Bernardin, at 747 N. Wabash Ave., Crain’s also reported. The firm paid about $89 million for the 25-story complex in 2005, a year after it was completed.Both complexes are close to full occupancy, having rebounded from a sharp drop as some renters left for the suburbs or their parents’ houses in the early months of the pandemic. But that has changed. And on the sales side, over 12,000 Chicago-area homes were purchased in April, continuing a nine-month hot streak, according to a recent report.Rental properties are also filling up again, and landlords and prospective buyers are taking notice. In late April, the 548-unit Shoreham apartment tower in Lakeshore East hit the market. PNC Realty Investors oversees the Shoreham at 400 E. South Water Street for owner AFL-CIO Building Investment Trust. The asking price was not known, but buildings comparable to the 47-story complex have in recent years sold for up to $500,000 per unit.And last month, Alex Najem’s Fulton St. Companies proposed 1.1 million square feet of residential and office buildings in Fulton Market.

08:00 AM",Jeremy Sclar’s WS Development is putting at least another $46 million into its newly purchased retail assets on suburban Chicago’s North Shore.,"[""WS Development’s Jeremy Sclar with the Plaza del Lago (Bates, WS Development)Jeremy Sclar’s WS Development is putting at least another $46 million into its newly purchased retail assets on suburban Chicago’s North Shore.The Massachusetts-based firm landed a construction loan against Plaza Del Lago, the 100,000-square-foot property on the shore of Lake Michigan that claims to be the nation’s second-oldest outdoor shopping center. Old Second National Bank provided the financing.The planned renovations of the property, which WS Development declined to speak in detail about, mark another substantial investment into Wilmette’s retail scene after the firm bought Plaza Del Lago this year for nearly $59 million. This was mere weeks after dropping $110 million to buy the larger, 343,000-square-foot Eden’s Plaza shopping center in the same North Shore suburb.Eden’s Plaza holds a former Carson’s that closed in 2018, leaving a 152,000-square-foot space vacant until online retailer Wayfair leased it this year to establish a brick-and-mortar presence.Investments by Sclar’s firm have “provided confidence and momentum in the North Shore,” Wilmette Village Manager Michael Braiman said. “There is no space at Plaza Del Lago that is anywhere as big as the Carsons site, only small vacancies. It’s just in need of love and care, in terms of rehabilitating the facades, the architecture, the infrastructure, to restore it to its old glory.”Sales tax revenues in the village are outperforming last year’s spending and have grown each of the last several years, intriguing both retail tenants and real estate investors, he said.“We’re seeing folks spending money in town,” Braiman said. “There is a lot of interest from the development community in Wilmette, whether it’s in our shopping centers or downtown along Green Bay Road for restaurants and small independent retail.”The village recently approved a 100-unit multifamily development by Optima at Green Bay and Central Avenue, about a mile from Plaza Del Lago, which is set to be completed in 2023. Braiman plans to continue pushing for some more housing density in select locations as the village wants to offer more options for empty-nesters and other single-family homeowners to downsize into an apartment in the suburb instead of moving to Chicago.The village has only had high-level discussions with WS Development about its plans to reposition Plaza Del Lago with the $46 million loan. It has yet to issue any formal permits or approval for the project, but is working with the firm to do so by late this fall, Braiman said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Burke, who two days later joined the full Council in approving the tax break, has denied doing anything improper regarding the project.The post office property is in the 25th Ward of Alderman Danny Solis, who at the time of the tax-break vote was working as an FBI mole and secretly recording Burke and others.In addition to the Old Main Post Office documents, agents in November also removed documents and computer files regarding tax increment financing districts in Burke’s ward and businessman Perry Mandera, who just sold his North Side strip club and who recently opened a medical marijuana dispensary, according to the Sun-Times.

It was the sixth consecutive month with a year-over-year decline in sales, mirroring a wider slowdown in the U.S. housing market.But the regional market recovered over the first four months of 2019, when home sales consistently fell between 4 and 10 percent year over year. The May sales were enough to give some comfort to brokers who were holding their breath for the crucial spring buying season, according to Tommy Choi, a broker with Keller Williams and president of the Chicago Association of Realtors.Choi called the market “competitive, but stable,” with low interest rates and relatively affordable prices providing “reason for both buyers and sellers to be encouraged,” according to a press release.The region’s median home sale price continued to creep up last month, hitting $259,000, a 2 percent increase year over year, according to the report.The schism between prices and sales numbers was even sharper inside the city, where the median price climbed 3.3 percent year over year to reach $305,000. But fewer than 2,900 homes were sold, a 5 percent decline year over yearStatewide, home sales declined by about 1.3 percent while the median price nudged up by 2 percent to reach $219,000.The numbers show that Illinois homebuyers are “responding a little more conservatively” than during past years, despite consumer demand growing “more broadly positive nationally,” according Geoffrey J.D. Hewings, director of the Regional Economics Applications Laboratory at the University of Illinois.Chicago-area brokers got more foreboding news Thursday, when county officials announced that Downtown and North Side homeowners will see their property taxes go up by more than 11 percent this year.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Builders that an inspection earlier this month found a “hazardous” temporary electrical system behind a new house in the 6500 block of West Dickens Avenue. An “exposed live electrical cable was looped from building to building” to illegally connect power to three other houses in the Belmont-Cragin neighborhood, the document continued.City buildings officials issued a stop work order on the houses, cut off their electrical service and ordered occupants to vacate the homes.Buildings department records show a permit was issued for electrical wiring at the Dickens Avenue house on Aug. 10, four days after the inspector was said to have visited.The suspension is set to take effect Monday, though the developer has until then to request a hearing with the buildings department to contest the it.Tyler Manic, an attorney representing Noah Properties, wrote in an email that the “matters raised in the notice have been resolved,” but did not specify which violations, or whether the suspension was overturned.A city official said that a partial occupancy permit has been issued for one of the four buildings, but violations remain on all four properties.Founded by Przyjemski and Anita Lisek in 2002, Noah lists dozens of single-family homes and multi-unit residential buildings in its portfolio, most of them on the city’s red-hot Near Northwest Side.A couple sued the company last year, alleging defects in the HVAC system and windows of the Wicker Park condo they bought for $650,000 in 2014. The suit, which remains underway, which spurred Noah to file its own legal complaint against A.L.L. Builders. The city also sued the developer for building violations, then backed off when the violations were addressed.The city’s Aug. 17 notice described an Aug. 7 meeting between city buildings inspectors and Noah Properties, during which the electrician who had been permitted to work on the Dickens Avenue property said he had not handled any of the wiring there. Instead, a man who said “he is not a licensed electrician” and “is not employed by a supervising electrical contractor” installed the system “at the direction of Bart Przyjemski,” the city document reads.The city cited seven explicit violations that led to Noah’s license suspension, including one saying the company and associated contractor “performed or directed work that poses an immediate or imminent threat to the health and safety of workers or the public.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",6500 block of West Dickens Avenue

An $8 million in tax increment financing was also granted for the project.Originally proposed in 2019, the project secured low income housing tax credit financing in 2021. Initial plans called for a five-story building with 5,000 square feet of retail, 51 affordable housing units, 41 public parking spaces and 9 private parking spaces. The project hit a snag, however, when the city told developers there was too much parking and that it needed to be accessed from an alley instead of North Western Avenue.The new plan calls for a six-story building with 65 new affordable units, 5,000 square feet of ground floor commercial space and an outdoor public space. There will be a second-floor parking deck with 36 spaces — 18 for public use and 18 reserved for residents. The building will have a green roof and rooftop deck for residents.Despite initial traffic concerns, the parking entrance will remain on North Western Avenue, as many local businesses said the alley entrance would cause more logistical headaches.The city-owned parcels, which have been appraised at $4.925 million, will be sold to the developers for $6 — or $1 per parcel. The $35.7 million project will be funded by a $3.5 million mortgage, $8 million in TIF, $8 million in a DOH loan, $1.5 million in state tax credit donations and $14.5 million in low income housing tax credits.The funding funding plan is now headed to City Hall for approval.

All of them have pledged to make zoning more collaborative and transparent, and to either dissolve or democratize Solis’ Pilsen Land Use Committee.Whoever wins will be empowered to chart a new course for development in the gentrifying Pilsen neighborhood and in parts of the booming South Loop. The winner will also preside over the 62-acre field where Related Midwest won approval for its The 78 campus. Two candidates, activist Byron Sigcho-Lopez and nurse Alex Acevedo, earlier this month called for the city to delay the approval process for The 78.Unlike in the nearby 27th Ward, where developers have made at least $160,000 in contributions for a far less competitive race, real estate groups appear to have mostly stayed away from the contest to succeed Solis, according to an analysis of campaign donations by The Real Deal. Industry professionals appear to have spent just over $34,000 to influence the race, a fraction of the $392,000 raised by all five candidates as of Wednesday.Alex AcevedoAcevedo, the son of former state Rep. Edward Acevedo, appears to have received more donations from the real estate industry than any of the five candidates, with at least a quarter of his $94,000 fundraising total coming from developers, brokers or building groups.Most of Acevedo’s real estate donations came from builders and building trades, including $5,000 each from John James Construction and LiUNA Chicago Laborers, the union that also donated $250,000 to Susana Mendoza’s mayoral campaign.Acevedo also received $5,000 from James Horan, who owned the property at 1061 West Van Buren Street before selling it to Ohio-based developer Pizzuti Companies. Pizzuti later teamed with Related Midwest on plans for a 300-unit apartment building on the site.The Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters donated $2,500 to Acevedo’s campaign, and Heat & Frost Insulators Local 17 donated $2,000.“I’m proud to be endorsed by the unions, like LiUNA, Operating Engineers, Carpenters and Plumbers, which continue to offer our communities careers and living wages upon which our residents can raise a family,” Acevedo wrote in a statement. “I have also been outspoken on our need for a full audit of the development process, including my call to review Chicago’s zoning process in the wake of Solis’ corruption.”Aida FloresFormer school principal Aida Flores received the second-most real estate donations in the race, with at least $8,000 of her $76,000 fundraising total coming from the industry.But the bulk of that sum came from her sister, Century 21 agent Areli Flores, who donated $5,000.“I really believe in what she’s doing,” Areli Flores said. “She’s a great human being, and she’s always worked hard.”Flores also received donations of $1,000 each from DSO Properties and Jeffrey Malk of Keeler Real Estate.Hilario DominguezHilario Dominguez, a 25-year-old teacher endorsed by U.S. Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, landed the largest single donation in the race: $32,000 from Purple PAC, a group that has heavily supported Northwest Side Alderman Gilbert Villegas (36th) and Mendoza’s mayoral candidacy.But as far as real estate industry donors, Dominguez has counted few supporters. Acme Refining, a McKinley Park scrap metal shop, donated $1,500 last month. He got another $1,000 from Wells Plumbing & Heating.In all, about 5 percent of the $98,000 raised by Dominguez came from the real estate industry.Byron Sigcho-LopezSigcho-Lopez appears to be the top fundraiser in the race, with just over $106,000 donated so far, no thanks to real estate donors.The community organizer raked in tens of thousands of dollars from public-sector unions like the Chicago Teachers Union and Service Employees International Union, the same groups buoying Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle’s campaign for mayor.But TRD could not identify any developers, brokers or builder groups that have signed checks in support of Sigcho-Lopez’s campaign.Troy HernandezNone of the nearly $18,000 in donations received by data scientist Troy Hernandez’s campaign can be directly tied to real estate professionals or interest groups.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1061 West Van Buren Street

That home has a few other distinctions in addition to Barbie: the state’s largest residential pool and palm trees that have been flown in annually from Florida.Other top sales in the area ranged from $1.3 million to $1.6 million, a narrower range than June, when the top five ranged between $1.06 million and $2.2 million. The data was collated by Zillow from information provided by Midwest Real Estate Data and doesn’t include off-market deals. Read on for thumbnails of the top five.1) 13360 W 167th St, Homer Glen, $5.3 million\nThe 15,000-square-foot home sits on 4.5 acres on 167th Street, about 40 miles from downtown Chicago. It has a fountain court with a triple-arched entry and cut-stone walls, five bedrooms and nine bathrooms.The home includes multiple chandeliers, one in the primary bedroom and another in the two-story primary bathroom, which also has a jacuzzi and Greek columns. It has what the listing called the largest home pool in the state, inspired by parts of the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. The home, which has a movie theater, bar, spa and professional gym, also has a 20-car garage.Christine Wilczek and Jason Bacza with Realty Executives Elite represented the sellers and Mark Wright with Baird & Warner working with the buyers.2) 9761 Dewey Cir, Frankfort, $1.6 million\nThis 9,000-square-foot home sold for $1.6 million on July 18. The property includes four fireplaces and an outdoor fire pit, a heated four-car garage, wet bar, custom trophy cases, workout room, basketball court and in-ground saltwater pool.Built in 2005, the home is on about half an acre and has a four-car garage. Jessica Jakubowski with @properties Christie’s International Real Estate represented the sellers and Sunny Burfeind of Landen Home Realty the buyers.3) 1219 Bonnema Ct, Naperville, $1.5 million\nThis 6,600-square-foot home closed for $1.5 million on July 15.

Kim Scott of @properties Christie’s International Real Estate represented the sellers and Antonia Dimeola with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Chicago the buyers.The home was listed on May 28 and was under contract two days later, selling for the asking price. That’s significantly less than the $1.89 million that it sold for in 2002, according to Will County property records.4) 3908 Littlestone Cir, Naperville, $1.3 million\nThis 5,000-square-foot home, a six-bedroom, seven-bathroom home built in 2004, closed for $1.32 million on July 11. That’s well below the $4 million it was asking on April 22, and it went under contract May 2. The property includes a home theater and a 2,800-square-foot outdoor living space with custom European pavers imported from Denmark. The owners spent more than $750,000 to renovate the home during the past 10 years, according to the listing.Deepak Mehta with RE/MAX Professionals Select represented the sellers and Bob Dellutri with Wall Street Property Group the buyers.5) 12 Baker Ln, Naperville, $1.4 million\nThis 5,000-square-foot house, a five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home built in 2006 on one-third of an acre, sold for $1.4 million on July 15, compared with $1 million in 2009.

Under Reschke’s plan, floors 13 through 17 will remain offices.Prime Group CEO Michael Reschke told Crain’s he thinks there’s a “huge market” for a “small, five-star hotel” in the Loop, even in the midst of a recent explosion in new hotel capacity.About 6,000 hotel rooms came online in Downtown Chicago between 2014 and 2017, and 2,700 more are planned by the end of 2019, according to city tourism officials.The city’s largest cluster of luxury hotels remains in River North, where Denihan Hospitality sold the 297-key James Hotel for $83 million earlier this month, taking a $54 million loss on the property.Nearby, investor Hotel Capital recently bought the 122-room Tremont Chicago Hotel for $26 million, and Bixby Bridge Capital refinanced its Kinzie Hotel with a $30.5 million loan.\xa0[Crain’s] — Alex NitkinThis story has been updated to clarify Prime Group and Reschke’s role in the building.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",208 S Lasalle Street

The document also describes “multiple mixed-use buildings with ground floor commercial space, publicly accessible open spaces” and a riverwalk.Proposals don’t typically make it to the commission until they’ve been endorsed by the local alderman, whose support is crucial for any zoning decision to pass the City Council, thanks to the unwritten rule of “aldermanic privilege.” Hopkins said Tuesday that he is still undecided on Lincoln Yards, adding he wants to see the developer further pare down the massing of the plan’s tallest towers.Sterling Bay officials announced during the project’s last public meeting in November they had shaved a combined 100 stories off buildings throughout the site plan and boosted its planned park space from 13 to 21 acres.Unrelated to the plan commissions review of the proposal, city officials are expected next month to advance their plan to create a 168-acre new tax increment financing district surrounding the Lincoln Yards site, which could net up to $800 million for public infrastructure improvements over its 23-year lifespan. Hopkins on Tuesday suggested he would support the new TIF, pointing to successful nearby street improvements that also leaned on the funding mechanism.Outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel predicted Wednesday that Lincoln Yards will eventually become a reality in some form.\xa0 [Curbed] — Alex NitkinAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The couple paid nearly $1.4 million for the 4,000-square-foot house after it was featured in a January 2019 episode of “Windy City Rehab.”The Morrisseys claim they have since spent $80,000 to fix the problem-”plagued” home at 2308 West Giddings Street, including severe leaks, along with an improperly installed roof and windows.The Morrisseys filed a lawsuit against co-stars Alison Victoria Gramenos and her former partner, Donovan Eckhardt, to reverse the sale receive compensation for the repairs. Last month, the couple Discovery Inc., the parent company of HGTV, in the lawsuit.“Discovery’s promotion, endorsement, sponsorship, approval and certification that Victoria and Eckhardt were experts in real estate renovation and development was a determinative factor in Plaintiff’s decision to enter into the agreement,” the couple said in a motion filed late last month in Cook County Circuit Court. The couple is seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting Discovery from endorsing, sponsoring and promoting the “Windy City Rehab” hosts.In a separate motion, Gramenos and her lawyers argue that the couple’s request to shut down the show violates freedom of speech rights. They’re trying to get the entire case tossed.Gramenos previously offered to buy back the house and live in it.Production was put on hold for half a year as the show faced a dozen stop-work orders and a suspended contractor license.\xa0[Sun-Times] — Brianna KellyAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2308 W.

Valor’s two leases there expire by the end of next year.It’s the latest win for Tishman, which developed the 270,000-square-foot Sangamon Street property with Chicago’s Mark Goodman on speculation, without signing tenants before the pandemic drained downtown demand.The partnership defied the public health crisis. The building has been among Chicago’s best-performing of the pandemic, landing tenants such as biotech startup Hazel Technologies across 50,000 square feet as well as real estate tech company VTS, which leased 36,000. It’s now 87 percent leased. Hazel’s buildout of its lab and office space was just completed by Skender Construction, and its needs for lab space helped motivate the developers to alter their plans to include features required by life sciences and research and development teams.Tishman and Goodman just scored a $26.1 million loan on the property from Wells Fargo, a sign of its strong performance and ability to carry more debt after obtaining an $81.4 million construction loan in 2019.Valor’s exit from the Mag Mile is the latest tenant loss for Chicago’s Hearn, the firm that owns 875 North Michigan. One of its largest tenants, software firm SMS Assist, exited 85,000 square feet in the skyscraper six months ago when it moved to the Prudential Plaza complex at 130 East Randolph Street. The former Hancock Center’s landlord is in the midst of adjusting much of its office space for medical office tenants, rebranding it as the Mag Mile Medical Pavilion to market to doctors and hospitals that might want clinics in the building.Four new medical office leases totaling 35,000 square feet are being completed on the Mag Mile landmark, and the landlord may dedicate even more space within the tower to medical users than the 125,000 square feet planned now, Hearn President and CEO Steve Hearn told Crain’s. “We’ve had a very strong response,” Hearn said.Robert Sevim of Savills negotiated the Valor Equity lease on behalf of the firm, while Tishman’s Adam Mitchell and Ellen May oversee leasing at the Fulton Market building.[Crain’s] — Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",320 North Sangamon Street

His wife, Mae, and mother, Teresa, signed the deed for the home, paying $5,500.Capone did not return to the home after getting out of prison in 1939, moving instead to Florida, where he lived until dying in 1947. The family owned the home until his mother died in the 1950s, according to the Tribune.The six-bedroom building, which was lost in foreclosure in 2018, sits on nearly three full standard Chicago lots. MTGLQ Investors, a distressed-property subsidiary of Goldman Sachs, bought it in November and listed it in February.A previous owner listed it in 2009 for $450,000, cutting the asking price several times before taking it off the market in 2016 at $179,000, according to the Tribune.

01:00 PM","After years of major downtown office deals, investor activity in the sector has virtually gone dark.","[""Investment sales of Downtown office properties have cooled, hitting a 20-year low (Credit: iStock)After years of major downtown office deals, investor activity in the sector has virtually gone dark.Investment sales of office buildings in the central business district dropped to a 20-year-low this year, according to a new report from MB Real Estate. Through two quarters, only seven office buildings totaling less than 1 million square feet have traded, the report said.The lack of investor activity comes despite a surge of available properties in the central business district. In May, 22 office buildings were being marketed for sale, likely the most available at one time during this economic cycle, experts told The Real Deal. Currently, there are 16 buildings on the market, with five others under contract, according to MBRE.The downtown office market had a particularly quiet second quarter, with only one building trading: the $22 million sale of 19 South LaSalle Street, which was bought by local investor Ruben Espinoza. Four other buildings went under contract in the second quarter, according to MBRE. Six office building sales closed in the first quarter.The quiet investor market, plus the surplus of available properties, can be chalked up to changing dynamics in the Chicago office market and changing political headwinds, experts said.For one, a rash of new office developments has increased the competition for tenants. Over 3.5 million square feet of downtown office space was delivered in the last two years, with 2.7 million more square feet expected to come online this year, according to MBRE. The vacancy rate for the Downtown office market stood at 12.5 percent at the end of the second quarter.Some of the city’s biggest office tenants, including BMO Harris and Bank of America, will leave the Central Loop for new office buildings. The large vacancies that will be created by those moves dampened investor appetite for some properties.But the single biggest factor hurting the office investor market in Chicago is the uncertainty over future commercial property taxes, said Kevin Purcell, president of Leasing and Management Services for MBRE.“The uncertainty involving real estate taxes is causing a lot of people to think twice about investing,” Purcell said.New Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi is working to overhaul the property tax system that he said unfairly penalizes homeowners in favor of commercial landlords. Some commercial properties, including apartment buildings in Evanston, have already seen big tax increases. Downtown properties will be reassessed in 2021.Investor activity will likely be at a minimum until there is more of an idea of what taxes could look like in the future, Purcell said.“Pushing more of the burden onto commercial assets, that will have a detrimental effect going forward,” he said.The lack of recent deals does not mean investors have completely tuned out Chicago, Purcell said. Job creation and corporate relocations to the city remain strong, both good indicators for the office market.Guidance on the future of real estate taxes — and the continued strong absorption and lease signings — will likely lead to a return of the investment sales market, Purcell said.“When you see pricing on the coasts, Chicago still represents a value,” Purcell said. “There’s strong interest.

Tenants leased 4.9 million square feet of spec buildings between July and September.Build-to-suit made up 68 percent of industrial space built during the three-month period. Of 24 projects, eight fit that category, totalling 11.2 million square feet. They include two five-story Amazon warehouses in suburban Markham and Matteson that contain 7.2 million square feet.Some 24.6 million square feet was under construction in the third quarter. The largest building was a 1.2 million-square-foot facility for furniture e-commerce company Wayfair on Renwick Road in Romeoville. That project is expected to open in mid 2022.The increased need for last-mile warehouses and distribution centers driven by e-commerce demand fueled the industrial real estate market in Chicago this year. Industrial real estate sales totaled $1.52 billion in the first half of this year and are set to surpass last year’s $2.13 billion.Silver Creek Development’s $130 million acquisition of a Michelin warehouse property in Wilmington is the largest industrial sale in 2021.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

DeCab, Will, Lake, Kane, Kankakee and Cook Counties in Illinois, and Lake county in Indiana all ranked in the top 20.“A lot depends on the nature of the recession,” Attom’s Rick Sharga said in an interview. “What it means is that a market like Chicago is much more vulnerable to a housing downturn.”Attom ranked counties by four areas of concern: The jobless rate, the percentage of underwater loans, the percentage of a median monthly income that it would take to make a monthly mortgage payment and the number of properties that are in some state of foreclosure.Granted, a recession wouldn’t have nearly the impact on the market similar to what happened in 2008, mostly because there are few signs that unemployment is on the rise. That means it would have a more muted effect on housing.“If we do enter a recession it’s going to be almost entirely because of the Federal Reserve’s activity,” he said. “The economy isn’t doing too badly, but the Fed may need to slow it down because of inflation. Normally you go into a recession because you have some sort of weakness in the underlying economy.”Population attrition, the high cost of living and taxes, plus an increase in working from home all contributed to Chicago’s weakness, Sharga said. The Chicago area also elected to restart in-process foreclosures from before the pandemic sooner than other cities, causing additional strain.“Chicago real estate trends have not been as strong as a lot of places in the country, even prior to the pandemic,” Sharga said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

With east- and south-facing walls of windows, “we see the whole lake and the whole skyline.”The couple decided to sell their sky-high Chicago home after splitting their time between the city and New York, where Glenn is based as CFO of International Flavors and Fragrances. The condo, a combination of two separate units, has an L-shaped main area with sections for the living room, kitchen, media room and dining room.“People have their affinity for lake or city views,” Danielle Richter said. “But we don’t have to decide because we have both.”The flooring throughout the home is travertine, a nod to the building’s mid-20th century origin. The media room, at one end of the L-shape, can be separated from the rest of the home with a movable wall that retracts into the ceiling.The kitchen is decorated with white and mirrored surfaces, including the extra-thick slab of quartzite used for the island. Wall-height antique mirrors also “reflect the lake and the sky” in the kitchen.The primary bedroom suite, which includes a sitting area and a fireplace, was built in the space that used to be a separate studio apartment.

The West Loop, River North and North Michigan Avenue submarkets averaged the sharpest rent spikes, all posting year-over-year gains of more than a dollar per square foot.But the rent numbers hide the widening popularity of tenant concession packages landlords are offering to fill their buildings, which drag down net effective rents, Colliers International senior vice president Corby Marx said.“We’ve been seeing landlords in (class) B or B-plus buildings having to get really aggressive in fighting over that class of tenants,” Marx said. “Tenants are less willing to pay new-construction rental rates, so I thought these numbers would be ticking down a bit further.”The sharply higher tenant demand for class-A office buildings is pushing class-B landlords to shell out for major renovations, Marx added.About 139,000 square feet of Downtown office space were absorbed into the market last quarter, a positive but significantly slower figure than the 662,000 square feet Colliers measured during the second quarter.Rents and absorption were both boosted by WeWork’s pair of new leases totaling more than 200,000 square feet in River North this fall. The coworking giant’s expansions into 330 North Wabash Avenue and 515 North State Street accounted for the bulk of River North’s positive net absorption last quarter and helped shave the neighborhood’s vacancy rate from 9.1 percent to 7.6 percent.Big names like Facebook,\xa0Salesforce and CIBC\xa0are shepherding a pack of new tech and finance tenants to “buoy the overall market” for office space while other firms are shrinking or consolidating their footprints, Marx said.Landlords took a hit when W.W. Grainger and Holland & Knight both shrank their Chicago footprints last quarter, weighing down rents and cutting net absorption across the map.A CBRE report earlier this month measured a jump in the third quarter Downtown vacancy rate to 13.3 percent from 13 percent the previous quarter\xa0and 12.9 percent during the first quarter of 2018.Newmark Knight Frank, meanwhile, found that citywide office rents hit record highs last quarter.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",515 North State Street

But the lower parking requirements are “where the big savings come from,” according to John Brown, vice president of development at the Inland National Development Company.Inland last week secured a permit for a 100-unit apartment building along the Blue Line in Logan Square that took advantage of the ordinance by including just 29 parking spots.“Parking is usually under the building or on a podium, and that’s some of the most expensive space you can build, especially considering it generates almost no revenue,” Brown said.Emanuel’s announcement comes a day after he touted the launch of a $30 million fund he said would dole out low-cost financing to residential developments that include at least 20 percent affordable units. Details on the fund are scarce, but Emanuel said it would be seeded with $5 million from the city’s budget with the goal of attracting $25 million in private investments.Emanuel has signaled that he’s preparing a major speech on preserving affordable housing, set to be a key plank in his third-term platform. The mayor is amassing a suite of new proposals in advance of February’s election, when a growing field of challengers will vie to end his reign at two terms.The expanded transit-oriented development ordinance could go a long way to ease the path for developers planning new apartments, but it may be harder for the investment fund to make a dent, Lev said.“$30 million is nothing to sneeze at, but that just doesn’t sound like it’s very robust when you’re talking about the entire city,” Lev said. “But the devil is in the details.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

That makes it one of the most expensive deconversions in Chicago.The deal to sell all 449 units in the South Loop complex at 800 Wells Street came months after the owners balked when Marc Realty abruptly lowered its offer for the building, according to the Chicago Tribune.Marc Realty had sought to buy the complex since early 2016, and in December the sides agreed to a $100 million sale. In May, Marc Realty and partner Wolcott Group lowered their offering price to $89 million, saying they’d discovered costly repairs that would have to be made.Owners rejected that price, and Marc Realty came back with a revised offer of $90.5 million that was accepted Aug. 28, the owners’ attorney Kelly Elmore told the Tribune. The deal was approved by 78 percent of owners, just above the 75 percent required under Illinois law to force a bulk sale.Marc Realty will add another $1 million if all sale documents are in order within the next three months, Elmore said.The deal would be the second-highest price in Chicago for a deconversion, behind the pending $112 million sale of the 391-unit building at 1400 N. Lake Shore Drive to New York-based ESG Kullen.The most expensive deconversion by per-unit price would be a deal in the works for JMB Realty Corp. to pay $36 million for a 68-unit condo tower at 110 East Delaware in the Gold Coast, which works out to more than $529,000 per unit. Most deconversions average in the $200,000s per unit.Owners at 110 East Delaware still have to approve the deal, brokered by CBRE’s Sam Haddadin. Marc Realty earlier had been offering $30 million, or $441,000 per unit for the building.\xa0[Chicago Tribune] — John O’BrienAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",800 Wells Street

Providing the loan was Angelo Gordon’s mortgage investment trust, property records show.The new loan comes less than two years after Sterling Bay took out a five-year, $41 million loan from Mesa West for the Talbott Hotel. That loan came in late 2017, shortly after Sterling Bay unveiled a $20 million renovation of the hotel that added 29 rooms.Sterling Bay acquired the hotel in 2015 as part of a joint venture that included Conlon & Co., actor John Cusack, retired hockey player Chris Chelios, restaurateur Bill Rancic and billionaire hotel investor John Pritzker, Crain’s reported at the time. The venture bought the hotel for $51 million, the paper reported.The Talbott Hotel has 179 rooms and was built in 1927. A representative from Sterling Bay did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Sterling Bay is less known for its hotel investments than its major development projects, many of them in Fulton Market. The Lincoln Yards developer earlier this month unveiled plans for two new Fulton Market towers, one to be used as apartments and one as office space. The firm has also recently put up for sale its Fulton Market headquarters, seeking $200 million for the property.Sterling Bay also recently received initial city approval for its plans to construct a 46-story tower on North Michigan Avenue that would house 289 residential units, a hotel and ground-floor commercial space.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",20 East Delaware Place

09:00 AM",Damla Gerhart gained a new outlook on Chicago’s commercial real estate market on Monday.,"[""Damla Gerhart, principal and managing director, Avison Young (Avison Young, iStock)Damla Gerhart gained a new outlook on Chicago’s commercial real estate market on Monday.She landed a new role as Toronto-based brokerage Avison Young’s principal and managing director for its Chicago office, a change that will have her working with investors and landlords as well as tenants, after a career that emphasized tenant representation, most recently as CBRE’s leader for occupier services in the area.Her move comes at a pivotal moment for the city with the nation’s second-largest central business district, one pummeled by a pandemic finally waning after two years, giving landlords a chance to refill some of the record amount of commercial space abandoned during the health crisis. Gerhart’s paying close attention to the volume of workers returning to offices over the rest of this month, an indicator of leasing activity over the course of 2022.“While the recovery has probably been slower than we would have wanted in some cases, I think it’s going to continue, even specifically in the office sector,” Gerhart said in an interview with The Real Deal. “A lot of companies are planning on April being the time when they start getting some of their people back in the office. Even in the next month, we’re going to see some of that recovery really take place.”She’s filling a position recently held by Beth Phillips, who took the helm of Avison Young’s Chicago office in 2020 and left last year to join Caleb Hayes Enterprises, a real estate investment firm based in Wisconsin.Read on for Gerhart’s take on how much longer tenants will hold an advantage in office leasing and the influence retail and amenities will have on drawing workers back to Chicago.This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.It is still a very strong tenant’s market, from what I’ve heard. As this year continues, we will start to see some shifts, especially as people start coming back to the office. Some of these companies, their people have not stepped foot in their offices for two years. They’re going to come back into the same space they left and realize they have to make some tweaks.Working remotely, people got used to having privacy whenever they wanted it. When you go back to the office, you’re not going to have that everywhere. There are certainly going to be changes made with how space is designed and what people need to be productive going forward. As that happens, I think companies make changes. They will move, reevaluate, reconfigure their space. When that demand picks up, certainly it’s going to soften from being strictly a tenants’ market.I won’t share the name, but we did have a client earlier in the pandemic out in the market looking for space, and they knew there were going to be changes with hybrid working. They actually lost out on the space they wanted. This was in Fulton Market, so it’s very competitive. Another company came in and took it.When our client reentered the market and continued their search, they actually took on more space than they were initially looking for on the deal they lost. A lot of companies went really far across the pendulum, from thinking remote work will stay forever and we’ll do it frequently, to thinking we are going to grow and probably want people to spend some more time together than not.I was at CBRE for almost 10 years, and prior to that I was at JLL for almost seven. So I’ve made my way through some of the much larger organizations in our industry. Most recently at CBRE, I was the market leader for the occupier business. It’s a pretty critical time in our industry, so I felt like this was the perfect moment to take a leap.The recovery for retail goes hand in hand with more return to the office. A lot of companies are saying they need to earn their people’s commute. If I’m going to have you come in, even if it’s only two or three days a week, I have to earn that because [employees] are giving up a lot by getting in the car and trekking all the way into the office. Retail is going to play a big role in that.The flight to quality is real. If you look at the companies that did actually make moves in the last two years during the pandemic because they needed to, and their lease was up and they weren’t in a position to wait, they went to a nicer building.We’ll continue to see landlords and investors in some older buildings start to look at what they can do with those assets. Whether it makes sense to invest in an old office building and try to bring some life into it is up for debate. They might also consider, if they’re really trying to create more of the live, work, play scene in the Loop, that we all saw how much that died when the work went away. There wasn’t a lot of living or playing to do there. There might be opportunities to convert some of that into multifamily housing and some residential projects. Any smart investor is looking at their old assets to figure out what they can do to continue to compete.The occupier side of the business is where I spent the majority of my career so I know that really well. A big component of why I took the role is the chance to work more with investor clients and do some of that side of the business that I hadn’t had a chance to before. I’ve met some of the principals and a lot of the leadership team that I’ll be working with, so I’m thrilled with who I’ll be surrounded by.A big initiative is continuing to work in a really nimble way, which I think is one of Avison Young’s strengths. We have to continue to innovate and keep on this growth trajectory we have been on. This is our moment, especially as we come out of this [pandemic] and the industry is continuing to be disrupted.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The application didn’t say whether the project is an apartment or condo building, and Shapack didn’t return calls seeking comment. If it’s apartments, the firm will have to set aside 20 percent of the units for affordable housing.Jeff Shapack, who leads the firm, bought the 27,000-square-foot parcel for $8.5 million in 2018. His company has built or redeveloped properties including the 182-key Hoxton Hotel, a 29-story residential building dubbed The Parker, and the 84,700-square-foot WeWork office building. The firm has at least nine projects totaling 960,000 square feet that are either completed or proposed, according to CoStar.Last month, Shapack filed a zoning application to the City Council to replace a 156,000-square-foot facility at 170 North Green Street with a building of 275 apartments, office space, and 150 hotel rooms. The tallest portion of the building will rise at the corner of Lake and Peoria streets, while the rest would be about 14 stories high.Fulton Market was largely immune to the pandemic as developers bought the last remaining parcels to develop them into Class A buildings.

The gears appeared to have been set in motion in September 2019, when Churchill Downs announced it would not seek a casino license for Arlington Park, something it had previously said the location needed to survive.The company’s portfolio includes race tracks — the most famous is Churchill Downs, which hosts the Kentucky Derby — along with casinos and online betting. It purchased Arlington Park in a $72 million stock deal in 2000. No price was given for a potential sale.At the time of its decision not to seek a casino license, Churchill Downs said that Arlington Park faced a 20 percent tax hike compared to what gambling competitors pay. And even before the pandemic, the historic track saw declining revenue and rising costs.The potential redevelopment of such a large property comes at a time of high demand in the suburban housing market. January saw homes in 30 suburbs sell in half the amount of time it took for homes that sold in the first month of 2020. Home inventory is also a record low.The company said it would still hold its upcoming racing season from April through the end of September, and that it didn’t expect a sale before then.Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen said the firm expects “to see robust interest in the site” and that it looked forward “to working with potential buyers, in collaboration with the village of Arlington Heights, to transition this storied location to its next phase,” Crain’s reported.[Crain’s] — Alexi FriedmanAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Patton.The CEO of 548 Development, which has led projects city officials viewed favorably, said he has acquired property in the 3800 block of West Chicago Avenue with plans to include adjacent vacant city-owned land in a 60-unit housing redevelopment with a ground-floor grocery store, the Sun-Times reported. Project costs would be $33 million.While terms of Patton’s purchase in the West Humboldt Park neighborhood have not yet been disclosed in public records, the property containing single-story industrial buildings is bookended by vacant city parcels and last changed hands for $300,000 in 2019, when its current owner, Denis Vulich, bought it.The new mixed-use housing project will use solar panels to produce energy and include triple-pane windows to improve insulation, which will help make it the city’s largest “passive housing” structure, Patton told the Sun-Times, referring to housing designs maximizing energy efficiency.He wants its residents to have electric bills that are half the cost of comparable buildings and to cut the need for natural gas.“We’re solving … multiple community issues here,” he told the outlet. “It will be affordable, sustainable housing,” and he plans to have minority-owned contractors lead the project. “We’ve been very intentional about that,” he said.Patton’s foray into development began with rehabs of small apartment buildings a few years ago, and, as a Black entrepreneur, he has emphasized hiring minority-led contractors. He has obtained financing from sources other than banks that are less willing to invest in communities of color, and minority-owned firms Milhouse Engineering & Construction and Powers & Sons Construction will lead general contracting duties on the Chicago Avenue project, should it move forward.Chicago’s top planning official Maurice Cox has called Patton “an up and comer,” according to the Sun-Times.The Chicago Avenue site is along a business corridor Mayor Lori Lightfoot is aiming to improve through the Invest South/West initiative, a program meant to bring economic development to areas that have been ignored by investors.It usually involves developers making competing bids for blighted or underdeveloped property that owners have agreed to sell, and the city picks a winner. Patton has been awarded three other parcels through the Invest South/West program, his largest being the 21-acre former Copenhagen chewing tobacco plant where 548 Development is working with Related Midwest to build solar-powered warehousing.The project still requires approval from the city for a zoning change to move forward, and Patton is asking the city for $8 million in tax increment financing, which allows local governments to put property tax revenues generated by new development toward covering the costs of the improvements. The tax increment financing also still has to be approved by the city.Patton plans to break ground in the fall and open the project in 2024.[Sun-Times] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",3831 W Chicago Avenue

In the city and suburbs, some companies with expiring leases have downsized in moves or renewals, sometimes by as much as a quarter of the space they rented pre-pandemic.It is unclear where Fubo Gaming will head next. A spokeswoman for the company told Crain’s that Fubo Gaming “continues to be committed to locating its headquarters in Chicago.”Sublease offerings are drawing tenants looking for savings by renting at discounted rates from a tenant that has downsized or left a lease early rather than directly from a landlord at full price. A sublease offering at 515 North State Street is being considered by publicly traded cannabis company Verano Holdings, while marketing software company Braze subleased 50,000 square feet at 1 North State Street from another software firm Showpad early this year.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1 North Dearborn Street

(Russell Group, Getty)A proposed senior-living complex in Highland, IN, is still on track despite delays.The Highland Plan Commission granted an extension for The Russell Group to begin work on its planned development, the Post-Tribune reported. The Iowa-based developer now has until June to get approval for U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development financing.Commission President Doug Turich and member Hunter Balzco were the only no votes in the 5-2 decision to grant another extension for the project. Last June, The Russell Group was granted a six-month extension due to health issues as well as negotiations between the company and the property owner.Project attorney Jennifer Smith said this summer that the firm’s financial advisor suggested they apply for HUD financing. Gathering the information needed for the application took until fall, leading to the need for the extension.The Highland Town Council already approved rezoning the Griffland-owned land on Kleinman Road from its previous use as single-family residential. It’s now zoned R-3 planned-use development, contingent on an agreement that the full 20 acres would never be used as any sort of housing other than the $39 million senior-living facility. In addition, no one under the age of 55 will be allowed to live at the senior center for more than 90 days unless that person is a resident’s caretaker.The project calls for 70 independent-living apartments with full kitchens, in-unit laundry and parking; 50 to 60 assisted-living apartments with kitchenettes and laundry; and a memory-care unit with 18 to 20 apartments designed specifically for residents with Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia-related illnesses.Residents will have multiple dining options including meals prepared by an on-site chef. There will also be game rooms, a general store, a library and a salon. An on-site wellness center will have exercise equipment and offer daily fitness classes.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

If it fetches its asking price, it would be the priciest suburban sale of the year and the biggest residential deal in Kenilworth since 2014.The mansion includes multiple terraces, a grand staircase and a 100 feet of private Lake Michigan shoreline. It was built in 1907 by Paul Starrett, who worked for famed architect Daniel Burnham and later constructed the Empire State Building in New York City, according to Crain’s.Homeowners Mary and James Glerum bought the mansion in 2008 for $6 million. Mary Grant of @properties has the listing.The Glerums might find it hard to get their asking price in a North Shore luxury market that has cooled considerably in the last year.The popularity of Downtown luxury condo buildings has pulled buyers from the North Shore, where luxury inventory has ballooned in recent months. Even lakefront mansions have been hit by the phenomenon.This year’s priciest suburban sale to date was a lakefront mansion in Glencoe that traded for $5.2 million after originally being listed at $5.5 million.

It also gives brokerage some entree with a customer base for the auction house that operates with the same brand name.

02:00 PM","In a little-noticed audit summary last week, the Treasury Department’s Inspector General for Tax Administration said that the IRS continues to have “ineffective” controls to ensure that “legitimate taxpayers authorized the release of their tax transcripts” and that the agency “delayed actions to reduce unnecessary taxpayer information from being disclosed.”","[""In an era of unceasing horror stories about breaches of sensitive consumer information, here’s some disquieting news for homebuyers: Federal auditors say the popular “tax transcript” program run by the IRS and used by millions of mortgage applicants a year lacks adequate security protections against disclosures of tax-return details to people who shouldn’t be allowed to obtain them.In a little-noticed audit summary last week, the Treasury Department’s Inspector General for Tax Administration said that the IRS continues to have “ineffective” controls to ensure that “legitimate taxpayers authorized the release of their tax transcripts” and that the agency “delayed actions to reduce unnecessary taxpayer information from being disclosed.”In 2015, the IRS suffered a major breach of its “Get Transcript” program, which allowed individual taxpayers to obtain tax transcripts. Using taxpayer information stolen elsewhere, criminals were able to pass IRS authentication procedures to access the files of more than 334,000 taxpayers, opening the door to potential tax-refund frauds. Treasury auditors say the Equifax hack of more than 145 million consumer files last year makes it of the “utmost importance” that the IRS fix security deficiencies “to ensure against unscrupulous individuals compromising this system to gain unauthorized access to tax information.”The current audit targeted in part a specialized IRS service — one that provides lenders and others transcripts of loan-applicants’ tax filings. Mortgage borrowers routinely fill out an IRS Form 4506-T, which grants permission for third-party vendors to access their tax records and send them to banks and mortgage companies. Lenders use the service to verify applicants’ income.Following a home-loan-related request, mortgage companies and banks generally receive tax transcripts within two to five business days. The overall transcript delivery system (TDS) program — which includes services for lenders, tax professionals and others — is massive: According to auditors, nearly 169 million transcripts were issued during calendar years 2014 through 2016.A key security issue in the mortgage-related portion of the program is whether the third-party “requester” of a transcript has been properly vetted by the IRS and found eligible to receive transcripts. Some third-party players are giant corporations serving banks and the mortgage industry and order vast numbers of transcripts a year; others are small entities that order far fewer. After criticism about poor vetting, the IRS tightened its procedures in 2016 and required third-party entities to re-submit basic qualifying information. But auditors found the IRS still allowed more than 29,000 transcripts to be sent to parties that had not complied with the revised rules by its deadline and whose permission to participate should have been revoked.Auditors also noted the intersection of transcript issues with identity theft and fraudulent requests for tax refunds using stolen consumer information. During tax years 2013 through 2016, they found that 222,534 taxpayer accounts “had a total of 647,208 tax transcripts requested for the same tax year” of a confirmed identity theft. Investigators also highlighted the current transcript system’s absence of limits on the numbers of transcripts that can be obtained on a single individual taxpayer.Among the recommendations by auditors: Suspend the transcript service until better controls are established. The IRS declined to do so. But in a statement for this column, the IRS noted that it has now initiated the stricter controls sought by the audit, including multifactor authentication. This better enables the IRS to know “who is accessing its system and why and helps prevent account takeovers.” Auditors say they will monitor the recent changes to assess their effectiveness.Asked what a shutdown of the transcript program would mean, Brandon Brahms, senior product manager for CoreLogic, one of the highest-volume providers of transcripts, said “it would grind the [mortgage] industry to a halt.” Curtis R. Knuth, president and CEO of NCS, another major provider, told me that although data security “needs to be tightened” further, changes undertaken by the IRS since late 2017 have improved protections. “Is anyone satisfied? No,” he said, but the IRS is making efforts despite severe budget cuts.Bottom line for you as a mortgage applicant: Take the 4506-T form seriously, not just as another piece of the paper blitz involved in obtaining a loan. Most important: Never leave blank line 5 of the form, which identifies the third party that will obtain the transcript, and always fill out the specific tax years you agree to share.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Alderman Harry Osterman (48th) did not say whether he would support the proposal, according to Edgeville Buzz.The meeting was organized by the East Andersonville Preservation Task Force, whose members have said the proposal is crucial to warding off developers who would demolish existing homes and replace them with three-story condo buildings.The eight short blocks bounded by Clark Street, Bryn Mawr Avenue, Glenwood Avenue and Foster Avenue mostly comprise two- and three-flat apartment buildings, but they’re surrounded on three sides by single-family zoning designations. The three blocks directly to its south are also zoned RT-4, but they’re represented by Alderman Ameya Pawar (47th), who generally supports denser housing in wealthy areas near transit stations.Osterman said he would decide during the next few weeks whether to request a zoning change in the City Council.Data published last week by DePaul University’s Institute for Housing Studies showed that Chicago lost more than 20,000 walk-up apartments and condos between 2010 and 2016, leaving fewer affordable options for renters.\xa0[Edgeville Buzz] — Alex NitkinAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

An above-ground parking garage would be built immediately to the east to service the entire development.The first phase would also create a tree-lined pedestrian “slipway” leading into the site from Southport Avenue and a partial extension of Kingsbury Street. Scott Duncan, a partner at lead architecture firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, said Kingsbury would be a “shared street” like Argyle Street in Uptown, but a diagram of the road showed distinct sidewalks and unprotected bike lanes.“It’s important to be able to create a destination on day one, and create a sense of neighborhood immediately by defining the streetscape,” Duncan said. “At this point, the site is so empty that putting a single building there wouldn’t really achieve that.”Planners also shaved a combined 100 stories off the heights of buildings across the development since the previous version of the proposal, including lowering its tallest building from 800 feet to 650 feet. But principal Keating Crown said Thursday the site still would be built to accommodate up to 5,000 residents and 23,000 permanent jobs, the same benchmarks the company set in July.Sarah Astheimer, a principal of the landscape architecture firm James Corner Field Operations, showed lush renderings of the seven publicly-accessible parks and plazas being proposed under the expanded 21-acre collection of open spaces.The north section of Lincoln Yards would include a “foundry playground” with tube slides that mimic the Finkl Steel foundry, a “furnace garden” with open firepits, a “great lawn” facing the river and three overlook decks allowing people to step down to the water.Plans for the south section of the site include two soccer fields and a baseball field just north of the 20,000-seat stadium where a United Soccer League expansion team would play.Sterling Bay and city officials have both pointed to a proposed “transitway” between Downtown and Lincoln Yards as a key to managing the heavy traffic that would accompany a professional sports venue. But few details have been released on the proposed route, including which agency would operate it.“Overlook decks” over the North Branch of the Chicago RiverAlderman Brian Hopkins (2nd), who earlier this year moved to block City Council discussion of the proposal until it earned his approval, said he was noncommittal on the newest version of Sterling Bay’s plan but said that “there seems to be something close to consensus for something like” it.The alderman also rebuffed a resident’s request to hold his decision until next year’s mayoral election, saying he would not “intentionally slow it down for no good reason.”Earlier this month, city planners proposed creating a new tax increment financing district they said could raise up to $800 million to help fund public infrastructure improvements around Lincoln Yards.Erin Lavin Cabonargi, Sterling Bay’s former director of development who presented Sterling Bay’s plan during the July meeting, has since left the company to run her own development and consulting firms.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1515 West Webster Avenue

The area’s 1890s heyday left it with one of the highest concentrations of historic greystone buildings in the city, and a two-mile L-shaped boulevard carves a lush green path to the 173-acre Douglas Park.It’s one of just a few neighborhoods outside Downtown that’s accessible by two CTA rail lines, and it’s home to the 1,700-seat Central Park Theatre, one of Chicago’s most grandiose Vaudeville-era venues. Some buyers have begun to take notice, with home prices appearing to jolt in 2018 after years of flatlining.Today, the combination of creeping interest in adjacent neighborhoods and an accelerating revitalization effort around Sears’ former Homan Square headquarters is mapping out a hopeful future for North Lawndale.In the beginningThe eastern half of North Lawndale was annexed into Chicago in 1869, immediately becoming a home for Bohemian immigrants. Everything west of current-day Pulaski Road, an area known as “K-Town” for its alliterative street names, followed 20 years later, earning a reputation as a mini-metropolis of Czech workers and their families.The neighborhood’s early-20th century ascendance can be tracked through the dozens of ornate houses of worship that still line its streets: Baroque-style Central European Catholic churches were joined by synagogues starting in the 1920s, and Southern Baptist congregations began setting up inside both kinds of buildings after World War II. By 1960, nearly 125,000 people lived in the 11-square-mile area roughly bounded by Western Avenue, Ogden Avenue, Cicero Avenue and Taylor Street.But almost as soon as African-Americans began settling there, the politics of White Flight drove the neighborhood’s wealthier residents to the suburbs, hurried along by “panic-peddler” real estate investors who encouraged homeowners to sell low and fast.The 1968 race riots that scorched the West Side after King’s assassination kicked off a domino effect of big businesses abandoning North Lawndale, most significantly Sears, which shuttered its Homan Square campus in 1974. The neighborhood’s population and wealth have been in freefall ever since.Signs of changeResidents in the northeast corner of the neighborhood saw a turning point starting in 1989, when developer Charles Shaw drew up a redevelopment plan for the 14-story tower and surrounding brick office buildings that used to be Sears’ company headquarters.Homan Square Community CenterSince then, the Homan Square Community Center reopened the 112-year-old tower, which is now home to a hodgepodge of nonprofits and community groups. The Shaw Technological and Learning Center opened in the company’s former power plant building, and last year Mercy Housing Lakefront completed a $65 million redevelopment with 181 affordable apartments in the company’s former mail-order plant.In 2015, the late-summer music festival Riot Fest moved to Douglas Park, pleasing surrounding business owners and introducing thousands of young music fans to the neighborhood.The view from Nichols TowerIn 2016, the leaders of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago decided to focus their “community engagement” efforts exclusively on North Lawndale, and they opened an office in the redeveloped Homan Square tower, now called the Nichols Tower. The school is piloting a five-year project called The Oaks of North Lawndale, modeled after a similar effort in Germany, aiming to plant up to 7,000 trees in the neighborhood by 2023.Also in 2016, the North Lawndale Community Coordinating Council and the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning began working on North Lawndale’s first comprehensive development plan in decades. A seven-chapter draft of the plan, released earlier this year, suggests chartering homeowner groups and launching a marketing push to attract outside investors, among a raft of other recommendations.TransportationNorth Lawndale is hugged by the Blue Line near its northern boundary and the Pink Line at the south, where the Central Park station drops visitors in a growing commercial district anchored by the Lawndale Christian Health Center and a Lou Malnati’s pizzeria.At one time a nexus for a half-dozen streetcar lines, the neighborhood now sees buses run every day along Roosevelt Road, Central Park Avenue, Pulaski Road, 16th Street, Kedzie Avenue and Cermak Road.Separated bike lanes along Central Park Avenue, Independence Boulevard and Douglas Boulevard give cyclists a continuous, if bare-bones, path through the neighborhood.Residential take“I grew up in Logan Square 30 years ago, and it felt kind of like what Lawndale is now — an impoverished community, but one that still had a little bit of everything,” said Moe Pacheco, an Oak Park-based broker with Baird & Warner who sells single-family homes and two-flats in North Lawndale. “It’s become a diverse community with some restaurants and grocery stores, but it hasn’t gentrified. The real estate value in Lawndale hasn’t boomed in the way that it has in neighboring areas like East Garfield Park and Tri-Taylor, which is interesting because it has more amenities and less vacant land than Garfield Park. There’s this misconception that it’s crime-ridden and you have to dodge bullets, but other than construction workers getting their tools stolen, I haven’t run into a lot of [brokers or contractors] who deal with violent crime.”Unity ParkCommercial take“It’s a unique, somewhat thinly-traded market,” said Niko Voutsinas, a Redfin broker who represents buyers of multifamily buildings on the West Side. “For investors who are comfortable with the business model, which is largely Section 8-oriented, it can work. What’s a little frustrating from an agent’s perspective is how little transparency there is in marketing — often it’s either a flip of a flip and the seller knows nothing about it, or it’s a landlord who’s worn out by their tenant and wants to disclose as little as possible. But the risk is baked into the prices, and you can get a steal of deal if you’re comfortable taking it on. You could get some eight-unit buildings for $250,000, and make up to a 20 percent annual return.”Demographics2015 population: 35,276 (down 1.8 percent since 2010)Median age: 28.6Median income: $22,383Average residential sale price within the last 12 months$79,250 — $64 per square footAverage current residential listing price$120,000 — $67 per square footPriciest residential sale1672 South Albany Avenue — $461,000Most expensive home on the market2546 West Grenshaw Street — $550,000Least expensive home on the market1428 South Kedvale Avenue — $34,900Price trends (Redfin)North Lawndale’s median home sale price shot up by 73 percent between June 2017 and June 2018, jumping from $60,000 to $104,000.

They’re projected to open a combined 1.26 million square feet of apartments, offices, hospitality and retail during the next several years.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1672 South Albany Avenue

Lake Park Ave., Chicago (Getty, Google Maps)Preservationists are pushing to landmark a Chicago home that legendary blues singer Muddy Waters bought in the 1950s.The group includes city officials and a Waters descendent who owns the North Kenwood home that has fallen into disrepair, according to Crain’s. Local Alderman Sofia King plans to host a virtual community meeting on the proposal in early June, in hopes of getting the proposal to the City Council sometime this year.The home at 4339 S. Lake Park Avenue — called a two-flat — is vacant and has seen better days. Waters’ great-granddaughter Chandra Cooper owns the property. She is raising funds to turn it into the Muddy Waters Mojo Museum; “Got My Mojo Workin’” was one of the singer’s best-known songs.Waters, whose real name was McKinley Morganfield, was born in Mississippi sometime between 1913 and 1915 — dates differ. He spent the first few decades of his life there before moving to Chicago in the early 1940s.He bought the Lake Park Avenue home in 1954 near the height of his fame, and lived there for about 20 years, according to Crain’s. The property passed onto family members after he died in 1983, and has been with the family since.The National Trust for Historic Preservation and Landmarks Illinois have awarded grants toward restoring the property. If landmarked, it would be the second home of a prominent Black historical figure to be designated in the city this year. In January, the Woodlawn building where Emmitt Till once lived, at 6427 S. St. Lawrence Avenue, was landmarked. Till’s 1955 murder in Mississippi at the hands of two white men was a catalyst for the civil rights movement.[Crain’s] — Dennis LynchAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",4339 S.

J.B. Pritzker halted a proposed racetrack and casino in Tinley Park after it was revealed that a gambling operator pushing for the project has deep real estate ties to a banking executive whose alleged affiliation with the mob helped kill the Emerald casino nearly two decades ago.Gold Rush Gaming owner Rick Heidner has several active real estate partnerships with Parkway Bank & Trust chairman Rocco Suspenzi through shell companies, according to an investigation by the Chicago Tribune. Heidner and the Suspenzi family have borrowed millions from Parkway Bank to buy commercial properties in several states, the paper found.Suspenzi, his son Jeffrey, and a reputed mob figure were exposed by the FBI in 2003 for concealing their ownership stake in the Emerald casino project, which had its license revoked. Parkway Bank also made a seven-figure loan to another alleged mobster involved in the casino project, according to the Tribune.Pritzker informed village officials this week that it would not sell state-owned land to the village for the “racino,” though he didn’t cite the Tribune’s investigation into Heidner’s business relationship with Suspenzi.On Tuesday, Heidner testified under oath that Illinois Gaming Board investigators had full knowledge of his business ties to a convicted bookie and Suspenzi. He also denied having any affiliation with the mob.In addition to the “racino,” Heidner has proposed a hotel and entertainment complex at the site of the former Tinley Park Mental Health Center.Heidner may have bigger problems to deal with: his name came up during the FBI’s sweep of Democratic state Sen. Martin Sandoval’s Capitol office last month, and separately, a search warrant of McCook Mayor Jeff Tobolski’s office.Parkway Bank, meanwhile, has been rumored to be for sale since at least 2017. Parkway is the second-largest privately held bank in the area, with $2.7 billion in assets. But 84 percent of its $2 billion in loans is in commercial real estate, with over 18 percent issued to affiliates of just one company — Inland Real Estate Group. Another aggressive real estate lender, Bank of the Ozarks, was reportedly interested in buying Parkway but didn’t make an offer. Earlier this year, Byline Bank began negotiations to merge with Parkway but it’s unclear where things stand now.

Another project is set to bring senior housing to the area.An apartment building at the northwest corner of the intersection was demolished for the project and a city-owned building that was once home to Magna Electric will soon meet the same fate, Ed Cage, Oak Forest’s director of economic and community development, told the outlet.The four-acre site is in unincorporated Cook County and will be annexed into the city of Oak Forest.The first phase calls for row houses along 157th Street, close to Lamon Avenue to the west. A later phase would include a four-story building with apartments and ground-floor commercial space.Demolition for the $26 million project, which will cover a full city block, is expected to be completed by the end of September with some site preparation done before the winter weather arrives.“I would expect the majority of the work to start next year,” Cage told the publication. “It’s a major project [and] the city is very excited about the development.”Like other southern Chicago suburbs, Oak Forest has been trying to increase transit-oriented developments. The addition of housing and retail near the community’s Metra station works toward that goal.The other project, which is expected to break ground next year, calls for a senior housing development at the northeast corner of Cicero Avenue and 151st Street.

Neighbors and preservationists had been outraged when the congregation had to leave to make room for condos.“I am deeply committed to preserving the historic Epworth Church building,” Osterman said on Facebook. “I am working with the city of Chicago’s Commission on Chicago Landmarks to landmark Epworth and ensure it will not be demolished.”The church at 5253 North Kenmore Avenue was built with the help of noted architect Frederick B. Townsend. It expanded in the 1930s when a community house was added to accommodate the growing congregation.The church, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, was classified as “orange-rated” under the city’s historic survey, meaning it has “architectural or historic significance in its community.” That meant the demolition requests were subject to a 90-day delay for city officials to decide if it would be appropriate to tear down the structure.The demolition request “flies in the face of what the community wants,” Osterman said.Plans for the redevelopment haven’t been released and the owner hasn’t made any public comments about the project. Osterman said he hasn’t seen the final plans.The Epworth site is already zoned for residential use and has served as a homeless shelter for decades for Cornerstone Community Outreach.

It includes a pool and a private beach on Lake Michigan. The home is listed at $6 million, but it won’t be clear if the sellers took a price cut until the deal closes.Jena Radnay, an agent with @properties Christie’s International Real Estate is representing the sellers, who are not identified in public records. She did not respond to a request for comment. Radnay is also the listing agent for the $8 million listing directly next door. The five-bedroom, seven-bathroom modernist home, which has 130 feet of frontage on Lake Michigan, last sold for $5.1 million in 2019.Radnay said in the listing that both properties are available to purchase so a buyer could “combine both lots to make one grand private lakefront two-acre estate.”The home next door is still listed as active on public listing sites, meaning the two will likely have different buyers.The properties join several other ultra high end listings in Glencoe, as the priciest segment of Chicagoland’s housing market is proving most resilient to the broader real estate downturn. Across Chicago and its suburbs, the luxury market continues to have plenty of deals, though many sellers had to take price cuts.The neighboring mansions aren’t the only high-priced properties in the village–and certainly not the most expensive. Glencoe’s priciest homes on the market, at 505 and 595 Longwood Avenue, were both listed through a private network for $14 million each earlier this year, and the property at 595 Longwood has since been publicly marketed.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",333 Surfside Place

Ventas’ net operating income was $466.5 million, up 1.1 percent year over year. That came despite its senior housing portfolio seeing same-store net NOI decrease 2.2 percent year over year, to $157.7 million.Ventas Chairman and CEO Debra Cafaro said the senior housing industry continues to see a “mismatch” in deliveries and demand, thanks to increasing supply that’s hit the market recently.“We continue to feel the effects in our senior housing business in elevated openings” of new facilities, Cafaro said during the earnings call.Industry wide, a flood of new senior housing inventory has caused occupancy rates to drop to 88 percent, a 20 basis point decline year-over-year.Ventas officials were hopeful that slowing construction starts will boost their senior housing portfolio. Starts in the first quarter were at the lowest level since the third quarter of 2012, Cafaro said. That’s coupled with the aging of the Baby Boomer generation, which should increase demand increase in the coming years, she said.“As a result of these positive trends … the supply-demand equation will flip in our favor after we work through” current supply, Cafaro said.Ventas is marketing for sale 20 of its senior housing facilities, and expects to net $120 million from the sales, officials said.The stalling of the senior housing market was made up for by Ventas’ investments in research facilities, Cafaro said.Earlier this year, Ventas announced a $1.5 billion investment pipeline into research and innovation facilities, starting with a $77 million development at Arizona State University. In April, Ventas paid $128 million to acquire a research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, between Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Rents at the facility have grown more than 10 percent per year since 2015, according to Ventas.Ventas also signed Yale to a 25-year, 250,000-square-foot lease at its New Haven, Connecticut facility. The university’s school of medicine, which is now Ventas’ largest research and innovation tenant, is replacing Alexion Pharmaceuticals. Alexion paid a termination fee to exit the lease, a move that helped Ventas’ first quarter performance, the company said.Net operating income from its medical and research holdings increased by 3.8 percent in the first quarter year over year.Ventas will begin the rest of its $1.5 billion research and innovation pipeline within the next 15 months, Cafaro said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",77 million development at Arizona St

A 40-unit row of townhomes at 10509 South Michigan Avenue in Roseland was the sole South Side property to change hands in the sale.Neighborhood Housing Services bought all the properties during the 1990s and built or renovated them with help from a patchwork of federal and local affordable housing tax credits. But as debts mounted over the decades, the buildings faced potential foreclosure before Villa Capital offered to pick them up in a privately-funded purchase, Villa principal Erik Hubbard said.The City Council last year forgave a series of loans the city had extended to NHS, and the nonprofit paid a $2.1 million settlement to the city in return. The agreement also stipulated Villa would buy the units, spend $3 million on building upgrades and keep the apartments affordable to renters who earn roughly half the city’s area median income.The sale comes on the heels of a new report from DePaul University’s Institute of Housing Studies showing a dwindling supply of affordable apartments all over the city, especially on the West Side. The number of affordable units in the Humboldt Park/Garfield Park submarket dropped by 5.3 percent between 2012 and 2017, and the number fell by 6.2 percent in Austin and Belmont Cragin during the same period, according to the report.David Goss of Interra Realty, which brokered the sale, said Villa’s takeover of the properties could help stem some of the forces squeezing low-income renters on the South and West Sides. Villa had already been managing the properties since 2015.“There’s not necessarily a lack of affordable housing in these neighborhoods, so much as there is a lack of quality affordable housing,” Goss said. “So for a respected operator like Villa to come in with a commitment to put money into the properties, to keep them clean and safe all while keeping them affordable, it’s a win-win for everybody.”Hubbard and co-founder John Pagone launched Villa Capital in 2006.

The firm is set to go before the city’s Zoning Board of Appeals next week for setback and open space variations, along with parking approval because the property would just 19 spots.If approved, the building would rise on land that was once part of the larger complex that housed Cuneo Memorial Hospital and later Maryville Academy, and dominated the intersection of Montrose and Clarendon.Harlem Irving Companies and JDL Development are building a 27-story, 373-unit tower there dubbed Eight Eleven Uptown. The project is expected to cost $125 million, according to Curbed.A Harlem Irving-led venture acquired a number of parcels in the area from the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart in 2016, taking out an $80 million mortgage from JPMorgan Chase Bank.The Mavrek building would sit just west of the larger project and feature units ranging from one-bedroom, one-bath; to two-bedroom, two-bath, said Katey Moore, controller for the firm. Rents have not been determined, she said.Moore said the deal to acquire the lot is pending.

Any additional property tax revenue generated through new development is directed to a special village-controlled fund and used to pay for improvements within the boundaries.Over the past several years, Mount Prospect has been incorporating a number of parcels expanding the south side of the village. The need for infrastructure development, such as roads with bikes and pedestrian access, prompted the need for a tax increment district.The proposed TIF area is bounded on the north by Dempster Street, on the west by Busse Road, on the east by an area just west of Elmhurst Road, and on the south by Oakton Street. Properties within the TIF district include a $2.5 billion data center complex on the former United Airlines headquarters. Village board members are set to vote on final approval in May.[Daily Herald] – Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The site is zoned for office, research and industrial uses.BP spokesperson Michael Abendhoff said the company expects to maintain the roughly 1,000 employees on the campus. But it has gradually moved hundreds of employees from its Naperville campus to Downtown Chicago over the past decade, most recently in 2016 when it shuffled about 200 jobs to its office at 30 South Wacker Drive, according to Crain’s.The large abandoned corporate campuses include the former GE Healthcare property in Barrington and the former Motorola Solutions headquarters in Schaumburg. But Schaumburg officials are looking at ways to convert the Motorola property into a large mixed-use development, and New Jersey-based Somerset Development is eyeing the former AT&T campus in Hoffman Estates for a similar overhaul.Franklin Partners, meanwhile, bought the former OfficeMax headquarters in Naperville, with plans to revamp the 350,000-square-foot property and lease it in smaller pieces.\xa0[Crain’s] — John O’BrienAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",150 Warrenville Road

Tenants and landlords pushed vacancy rate to an all time low of 4.4 percent in the third quarter, slightly dropping from 4.9 percent between April and June.U.S. Medical Glove inked the largest least in the third quarter, for nearly 1 million square feet at a former Caterpillar manufacturing plant in Montgomery, Illinois, about 40 miles southwest of Chicago.

It’s unknown, however, when Neiman Marcus’s lease ends — critical information that will determine how much the buyer will pay for the property. A longer lease will prove more lucrative by giving the owner more time to collect rent.It’s also unclear whether a buyer can tear down the property to develop a new hotel or a residential building, Crain’s reported.UBS bought the Neiman Marcus store and office space in 1998 for $104 million. It wasn’t until 2020 that UBS split up the retail and office space. The offices aren’t on the market,, according to JLL’s listing.Retail on the Mag Mile has suffered during the pandemic.

Physically distancing from others and avoiding large groups remain vital to slowing the spread. However, taking a scenic drive can be a refreshing, safe way to get out of the house. Here are a few of our favorites across the city and suburbs.Chicago’s grand lakefront highway is obviously a tremendous place to start. Stretching over 15 miles from Jackson Park to Edgewater, LSD is easily Chicago’s most picturesque ride. With traffic at record lows these days, there is hardly a better time to enjoy the drive. It’s not only traffic that’s missing from the lakefront, though: warming temperatures usually brings Chicagoans by the thousands to the adjacent Lakefront Trail and beaches. Seeing as these areas are closed for now, a cruise down LSD is essentially the closest you can get to the lakefront.Who says Chicagoland isn’t hilly? A stretch of this small road about two miles long between Lemont Road and Joliet Road is a local gem. It cruises along the side of, you guessed it, a bluff, and offers a great view of the adjacent Goose Lake and Des Plaines River. As the road and views are unlit, this one is definitely best enjoyed between dawn and dusk.The North Shore has its own answer for hilly and windy roads in a famous stretch of Sheridan Road. Heading northbound, around Tower Road in Winnetka is where things start getting interesting. Through many curves both soft and abrupt, you’ll wind your way through beautiful forestry and homes in a handful of communities along the way. It’s easy to get carried away, especially as Sheridan continues over 40 miles to the north into Racine, Wisconsin.Ever notice certain large Chicago streets that are flanked by green space on both sides, with homes set back significantly and accessed by smaller service roads? You’re probably on the city’s historic Boulevards system, an interconnected inner ring of such streets that wrap almost entirely around the city, connecting many notable parks along the way. It begins along the famous Midway Plaisance at the University of Chicago’s campus and continues to the west and north, connecting Washington Park, Gage Park, McKinley Park, Douglas Park, Garfield Park, Humboldt Park, and Logan Square. Conceived by a developer to raise property values on what was then the outskirts of the city, it began construction in the 1870s and remains not only a beautifully coordinated system, but a fascinating cross section of dozens of diverse communities.Many streets run through the Cook County Forest Preserve, but this stretch of Thatcher Ave is particularly pleasant. Some parts divide quiet residential areas from forest land, while others are wholly surrounded by woods. It also provides easy access to the Jerome Huppert and Thatcher Woods, as well as the Des Plaines River Trail.When you think of scenic drives in the city, what comes to mind first? Perhaps Lake Shore Drive or vibrant neighborhood corridors? It certainly isn’t this stretch of Stony Island, which few people ever have reason to take as it’s arguably the sparsest area of the entire city. But take it you should, as you’ll find a stunning expanse of desolate prairie right in the city. You’ll also find Big Marsh Park, a massive park known for biking, hiking, and even bird watching.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

These seven properties and eight others previously belonged to the Rev. Leon Finney’s nonprofit management company Woodlawn Community Development, which filed for bankruptcy in October 2018 amid mounting debt and allegations of fraud.“The city wanted to make sure it could ensure the fate and affordability of the lots, consistent with the fair and equitable development of the neighborhood,” Department of Housing spokesman Don Terry said in an email.When the city approached Community Initiatives about acquiring the interest in the properties, it didn’t specifically mention real estate pressure from the Obama Presidential Center, but “it’s no secret there’s a desire to try to have some influence over the planning process and what’s happening with vacant land in Woodlawn,” director Jonah Hess told Crain’s.Despite its unclear construction timeline, the Obama Presidential Center is already drawn out-of-town investors to nearby neighborhoods, including Woodlawn. This activity is prompting gentrification concerns among housing advocates and residents who worry it will encourage home prices to skyrocket. The Real Deal previously reported that the Obama Presidential Center has attracted multifamily investors from across the U.S. to buy land in Woodlawn.About 30 aldermen support an ordinance that would allow for the creation of a community benefits agreement for the Obama Presidential Center.The auctioned-off properties would become part of the city’s Troubled Buildings Initiative in which turns vacant and abandoned structures into affordable housing.

The developer plans to incorporate a mural on the building by artist Antonio Beniquez.Hispanic Housing bought the vacant lot for $1.2 million in 2019 after developer City Pads and startup Common’s proposal to build an apartment complex geared toward millennials for the property fell through.The building will comprise 40 three-bedroom, 15 two-bedroom and nine one-bedroom units, according to a presentation from the Chicago Department of Planning and Development.\nApartments will be affordable to households making between 30 and 60 percent of the area median income.Affordable housing has been a priority for Mayor Lori Lightfoot. The city will invest in 24 developments to create or preserve 2,428 rental units as part of a $1 billion package it announced last month, double the allocation of $398 million in 2019.

They said the planned parking lot also doesn’t support the city’s goals to prioritize public transit over personal vehicles.According to city officials, Martin and Community Builders haven’t made the requested changes to their plans or communicated the cause of the delay to residents. One official said Martin, instead, led “an extensive process that was divorced from the reality of what the city would support.”Martin said that while the issue came up before the project was chosen to be considered for tax credits, he thought there would be more wiggle room moving forward.“It’s one thing to share policy preferences; it’s another thing to say, ‘This is not going to happen after a certain point unless X, Y and Z are changed,’” Martin said. “I was not told, especially in writing, prior to the December announcement, that parking was a nonstarter in any way. … I think that this [current design] is a fair compromise.”Housing Commissioner Marisa Novara said the purpose of these affordable housing developments is supposed to be to “reduce parking, increase density and maximize affordability.”[BCC] — Victoria Pruitt\xa0\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",4715 North Western Avenue

Construction began in July and the project is expected to be completed in the summer of 2024, said Sterling Bay spokeswoman Julie Goudie.The only announced tenant for the building so far is anchor Boston Consulting Group, which closed a deal to occupy about 200,000 square feet. Goudie said Sterling Bay is in advanced talks with other possible tenants. The building will have a total of 490,000 rentable square feet, according to its website.The project is moving forward in a bifurcated office market as downsizing tenants seek newer, amenity-rich buildings. Class A and trophy offices accounted for 90 percent of new leases in the second quarter, according to JLL, with business concentrated in the West Loop. Fulton Market is the fastest-growing urban office market in the U.S.Construction on Sterling Bay’s first multifamily project in Fulton Market is also underway. Along with Denver real estate private equity firm Ascentris, the group landed an $81.8 million construction loan from Chicago-based CIBC Bank USA for a 30-story, 2828-unit apartment building and more than 2,600 square feet of retail space at 160 North Morgan Street.The firm’s biggest ongoing project in Chicago is Lincoln Yards, a 53-acre, $6 billion mixed-use megadevelopment on former industrial land along the North Branch of the Chicago River that will include residential, retail and office space; hotels and restaurants; a life sciences research center; a soccer stadium; a six-acre park and an expansion of The 606 Trail.Sterling Bay’s previous major projects include Google’s headquarters at 1K Fulton, the 159-key Ace Hotel at 311 North Morgan Street, and the 575,000-square-foot McDonald’s global headquarters at 110 North Carpenter Street.

The state announced plans to auction off the 23.4-acre riverfront property back in August.The Chicago-based company plans to demolish the old grain silos, which were declared useless in 2005, and build a new corporate headquarters in its place. MAT’s owner, Michael Tadin Jr., said the property will also include infrastructure that will serve its trucking fleet, which currently operates out of Stockyards Industrial Park in the Back of the Yards and includes waste hauling and construction vehicles.Work to prepare the site will likely take a year before the firm can even start planning the redevelopment, Taldin said.The deal contributes to Gov. J.B. Prtizker’s overall plan to sell off properties in the state’s real estate portfolio that are either too old or too expensive to maintain. In a higher profile deal, it already unloaded a downtown property when Google bought the James R. Thompson Center for $105 million this summer. Officials said they estimate that sale will save taxpayers nearly $1 billion over the course of 30 years in maintenance of the dilapidated building set to be overhauled for the tech firm.The Damen Silos property, located at 2900 South Damen Avenue along the Stevenson Expressway, was previously used to mix road-construction materials for the Illinois Department of Transportation. The almost century-old site was also the backdrop for scenes in the 2014 film “Transformers: Age of Extinction.”MAT also helped develop the 633,000-square-foot Marina Crossings warehouse project in nearby McKinley Park.Minimum bids of $3.25 million for the Damen Silos property were due by Oct. 19 and Illinois’ Central Management Services received four.

(Google Maps)A businessman’s effort to curb eminent domain laws across the country ended Friday when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear his case involving a 15-year lawsuit against Chicago.On the last day of its term, the high court refused to hear Fred Eychaner’s case, which stemmed from the city’s 2005 decision to hand his River West property over to Blommer Chocolate Co.Blommer wanted to expand its candy-making factory and needed Eychaner’s vacant parcel at 460-468 N. Jefferson Street. Blommer had offered $825,000 for the property that at the time was surrounded mostly by former meat-packing warehouses.When the two failed to reach an agreement, the city swept in with its power of eminent domain and seized the property for Blommer, arguing it “may become a blighted area.”Eychaner, who founded Newsweb printing company in Lincoln Park, sued the city in 2006, charging that allegations of speculative decay abused the “public use” requirement.In 2019, he was awarded $7.1 million for the property, which now sits on the edge of bustling Fulton Market. But he wanted the high court to overturn a controversial 2005 ruling, Kelo v. City of New London, that allowed governments to take over property in a push to revitalize an area.Three judges were willing to hear it — Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — but a fourth was needed for it to get on the agenda.In his three-page dissenting opinion, Thomas called the 2005 decision a “mistake” that did a “disservice” to the Constitution. He also noted Chicago “decided to use the coercive power of the government to give the company a valuable parcel of not-yet-blighted-land.”Blommer, whose sweet chocolatey smells have drifted over the city for 80 years, is now owned by Fuji Oil Holdings.

The master plan is divided into four parcels across five city blocks.Shapack is working with New York-based architecture firm ODA to design three different possibilities for the buildings. Two of them include four towers and the other has five.A rendering of one of three massing options for NOMA development (ODA)The four-tower options each call for one of them to be 600 to 700 feet higher, significantly taller than the others. All the plans call for an L-shaped development, with floors that either taper in or cantilever out.The project joins a slew of others rising along the North Branch corridor. Sterling Bay is spending $6 billion developing the Lincoln Yards megaproject, which will include life science space, while Onni Group is planning a massive redevelopment of Goose Island that is expected to yield more than 2,500 apartments. In addition, earlier this year Bally’s won a bid to develop a $1.7 billion casino project on the Chicago Tribune Publishing Center in River West.Shapack is aiming for walkability and multiple public spaces, and is in talks with the Chicago Department of Transportation to gauge the impact of a network of corridors, known as The Mews, that would run throughout West Town and West Loop. Shapack is also taking into consideration points made by the committee on the impact the project could have on the local skyline and the neighborhood’s architectural feel.NOMA shown in gold (Model by Jack Crawford)The Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning and Chicago City Council would have to approve Shapack’s plans before the development can move forward.

Coppola (Macerich, The Magnificent Mile)Retail landlord Macerich has left Chicago’s Magnificent Mile.Macerich sold its 50 percent stake in The Shops at North Bridge building for $21 million, a fraction of the $515 million that it and partner the Alaska Permanent Fund, paid in 2008, Crain’s reported. The deal was for the 670,000 square foot property at 520 North Michigan Avenue as well as its 50 percent stake in a Wabash Avenue building, bought by the Alaska fund.The transaction could mean the North Bridge building’s owner is underwater on the $375 million mortgage. The sale price may represent only the price for the Wabash parcel, which doesn’t have debt, Crain’s reported. In that scenario, the Alaska fund would have paid nothing for North Bridge itself, as there may be no equity in it with its mortgage.The partnership was still able to extract money from the property since its purchase, even as the Magnificent Mile was hit hard during the pandemic. The partners refinanced in 2016, using some of the money to repay a $189 million loan and keeping the difference, reflecting the mall’s increase in value from 2008.Retailers have been vacating the Mag Mile, including Forever 21, which left 42,000 square feet along North Michigan Avenue before the pandemic. In some cases, landlords are struggling to replace them and building owners have tried to create smaller spaces for retailers. The North Michigan Avenue retail vacancy rate rose to 26 percent in 2021 from 5.3 percent in 2017, Crain’s reported, citing Cushman & Wakefield.New retail tenants are still seeking mall space. Leap, a Chicago startup that provides brick-and-mortar space for e-commerce brands, helped fill first-floor stores recently left empty by Sephora, Lucky Brand and Alex and Ani. The stores, totaling about 8,400 square feet, have been leased to Frank & Oak, United by Blue and Good Life, a Leap spokesman told Crain’s.North Bridge’s occupancy rate was 79.5 percent at the end of 2020, down from 86.3 percent in 2019, Crain’s reported, citing SEC filings.With the sale, Macerich reduced its assets in the Chicago area to just one Rosemont property, the 537,000-square-foot Fashion Outlets of Chicago shopping center, the outlet reported.“It definitely fits within their narrative of reducing urban locations,” Alexander Goldfarb, managing director and senior analyst at Piper Sandler in New York, told Crain’s.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",520 North Michigan Avenue

Nine of 22 storefronts don’t have a tenant and at least one was never leased, according to the outlet. In 2015, Lakota proposed changing traffic patterns around the plaza, building entertainment stages and installing outdoor seating. That never happened.Lakota suggested two concepts for the plaza at a meeting this week. One option was to reduce auto traffic and eliminate some parking spaces to create more open space for pedestrians, which gained overwhelming support from council members. The second was to maintain the current traffic pattern and the parking areas.Mayor Goczkowski cited an improved economic outlook, including the newly renovated Des Plaines Theatre, for reviving the discussion to develop the plaza. The theater reopened last October after a $6.6 million renovation that preserved an art deco-style stage front and built a new speakeasy-style bar and a restaurant on the top floor.Now that the project has the city council’s backing, Lakota needs to complete a concept drawing, said Kevin Clark, the firm’s principal and design director.The project, which will cost more than $6 million, could take about two years to complete, a city spokeswoman said. The development would include roadwork and streetscape improvements on Metropolitan Way near the plaza.[Daily Herald] – Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The first building for the Domaine apartments will begin accepting tenant applications in early 2023.The old Carson’s building, along with most of the food court area and two-story walkway connecting the two, were demolished rather than repurposed. Developers suggest a ground-up build better fits the vision. A four-story residential building with retail and restaurants on the ground floor will fill that space.The mall’s Center Court, which opened in 2019, will remain intact with the new plan, and it will have an added exterior wall that overlooks a 3-acre outdoor plaza, which will serve as a gathering space with room for events and other activities.Centennial said the new plaza will act as a central point that connects phases one and two to the retail space.Village officials approved the plans with the slightly relocated residential building.

Two months later, he scaled back his plans to include a seven-story, 72-unit building with ground-floor retail.The Chicago Plan Commission approved the scaled-back plans Thursday.Moyer is also redeveloping the landmark theater itself, planning to spend $70 million to convert the building into a 5,000 capacity entertainment venue, 16,000 square feet of retail, a 50-room hotel and 14 affordable housing units.The troubled concert venue shuttered in 2013 and Moyer bought it in 2015 for $16 million.“It was the wild west over there,” Alderman Joe Moreno (1st) said of the theater’s previous management. “This gem needs a lot of polishing.”The design for the residential building is not yet finalized and is still going through a city review process, city officials said Thursday.The city’s Community Development Commission in June approved using a total of $10.4 million in TIF funds for the overall project, according to reports.

Six individuals and teams from the hometown brokerage took home the top award of the night. Compass, the national brokerage that entered the Chicago market in late 2017, came in second, with three platinum winners.In all, six individual brokers received the platinum trophy, awarded to those with sales volume of at least $64 million. It was a good year for increasingly popular broker teams, with 16 such teams meeting that threshold.The threshold for Platinum Award winners was increased this year, perhaps thanks in part to a record-breaking year for luxury sales. In 2017, Platinum Awards were given out to individuals and broker teams with sales of at least $57 million. Eight individual brokers and 14 broker teams topped $57 million in sales volume in 2017, according to CAR.“It’s been a great year of growth,” association CEO Michelle Mills Clement said.The Chicago housing market got off to a solid start in 2018 that was followed by a severe cooling off in the second half of the year. Sales in the local market dropped by 3.7 percent, though prices rose by 3.2 percent. Chicago is forecast to have one of the weakest housing markets in 2019, though local experts believe an increase in inventory and Millennial homebuying interest could boost sales.The 2018 CAR Platinum Award winners for individual sales volume are: Nancy Tassone (James Sotheby’s International Realty), Robert Picciariello (Prello Realty Incorporated), Jena Radnay (@properties), Kathleen Malone (@properties), Sam Shaffer (Chicago Properties Firm) and Carrie McCormick (@properties).Winners of the 2018 platinum award for team sales volume are: The Lowe Group (Compass), The Hebson Team (Dream Town Realty), Dawn McKenna Group Chicago (Coldwell Banker), Matt Laricy Group (Americorp), The MG Group (Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Koenig Rubloff), Emily Sachs Wong Incorporated (@properties), Ames Group Chicago (Engel & Volkers Chicago), Leigh Marcus (@properties), The Biazar Group (North Clybourn Group), Brad Lippitz Group (Compass), Bari & Elena Real Estate Group (@properties), Barbara O’Connor & Company (Dream Town Realty), The KlopasStratton Team (Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Koenig Rubloff), The MVP Team (Compass), Home Discovery Team (Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty) and Weingberg Choi Residential (Keller Williams Chicago-Lincoln Park).There were seven individual brokers and seven teams honored with Platinum Awards for exceeding 142 total transactions.

The 2.3-acre development will include studio units as well as one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments. There will also be 10 two-story row houses with rooftop terraces along the riverfront. The low-rise apartment building will also have a rooftop terrace on the third floor for its residents.The city’s chief management officer, Alex Alexandrou, compared the project to Chicago’s River North area, and told the outlet that the city was going to be “creative and inventive” about developing the new neighborhood.Windfall Group, which is currently developing the Pacifica Square shopping center on the far East Side, has developments across the country using the Pacifica branding.Pacifica Riverview, at 309 North River Street, is being billed as a transit-oriented development due to the nearby bike trails and its proximity to the transportation center. Because of this designation, the development only has to have 1.5 parking spaces for each unit.

We saw some lower productivity as we were expanding rather quickly,” Brian Olsavsky said on the call. “We also saw some costs were moving — buying more inventory and moving inventory around in our network to have it be closer to customers.”Chicago’s industrial sector has been particularly hot, with developers showing no inclination to slow down. Some 18 projects totaling 4.7 million square feet of industrial space came online in the second quarter, according to a report from Colliers International. That’s the most new space delivered in a single quarter since the end of 2017. The same report found that more than 12 million square feet of space would be delivered by the end of the year.Since 2013, 227 speculative industrial projects totaling 61 million square feet have been delivered.

It’s owned by a retired couple, the investor Tom Harter and his wife Brenda, who planned to move to Florida after living in Naperville for more than 40 years, according to published reports. Lauren Dayton with Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty is the listing agent on the property.Jameson Sotheby’s Lauren Dayton (Sotheby’s International)Lauren Dayton with Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty is the listing agent on the property.It’s likely among the suburb’s most expensive single-family listings ever. Last fall, a 15,450-square-foot home on Van Buren Avenue near downtown Naperville was listed for just below $15 million. At the time, that was more than double the next-highest county listing of just below $7 million.In August, DuPage County’s priciest home sales ranged from $2.5 million for a newly-constructed six-bedroom to $4 million for a five-bedroom built in 1922 that last sold for $3.2 million in 2020, with most in the western suburb of Hinsdale.The Van Buren Avenue listing was removed in May. Both properties spent months on the market despite a surge in high-end buyers in the Chicago area this year.Midway through the year, 55 homes in Chicago had sold for $4 million or more in 2022, and have since surpassed last year’s record 101 homes that met that threshold. This year’s figure has at least 113 to set a new all-time high.Still, it’s possible that growing fears of a recession could rattle buyers and sellers, slowing an overheated real estate market. Plus, the single-family homes that command eight-figure prices in the Chicago area are concentrated on the North Shore’s suburbs, much closer to or on Lake Michigan’s shoreline.Yet one nearby high-end sale at a price well above much of the rest of the area’s luxury market closed earlier this year in an off-market deal in the western suburbs. In Hinsdale, the estate of Frederick Krehbiel, the late electronics company founder and nephew of a former White Sox owner, sold an 11,000-square-foot home for $7.5 million in a May.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Now, the Los Angeles-based mall owner has hired JLL to market the property at 1610 Deerfield Road, whose 50,000-square-foot Toys R Us store closed two years ago after the retailer went bankrupt, Crain’s reported. The mall is now 64 percent vacant.A new developer could demolish the existing buildings on the 7.6-acre property and construct up to 381 residential units, according to Crain’s, citing JLL’s marketing material.Balboa was formed in 2011 and has acquired over 3 million square feet of retail assets across 18 states, according to its website.The move comes at a time when retail continues to get pummeled. A new report from Coresight Research showed as many as 25,000 retail stores may close this year because of the pandemic, with a majority closing in shopping malls. That number would dwarf the prior record of 9,800 retail closures set in 2019, according to the report. Already, 15 national retailers have elected not to pay May’s rent, according to a separate report from Datex Property Solutions. And Macerich, which owns 47 shopping malls across the U.S., said it collected about 25 percent of rent owed by tenants in April, and a similar number as of mid-May.Simon Property Group, the nation’s largest mall owner, sued The Gap earlier this month for $66 million in unpaid rent across its properties and this week exited a $3.6 billion deal to acquire mall operator Taubman.Locally, Simon also skipped its $1.3 million May payment on the $257 million mortgage for Gurnee Mills mall; and a KKR venture with Pacific Retail Capital Partners missed its $333,000 payment on a $107 million mortgage for Yorktown Center mall.

Both it and a 7,100-square-foot Gap Kids location at 1740 North Sheffield Avenue will not reopen, according to the outlet.The pandemic has pummeled the already wounded retailer. In April, the Gap stopped paying rent on its more than 2,700 stores under various brands nationwide. Brookfield has been among the landlords that have sued the Gap for non-payment of rent. In July, the Gap responded, arguing in a lawsuit filed in Cook County Court that its leases with Brookfield should be modified or terminated. The Gap claimed coronavirus-related restrictions made the core purpose of those leases “illegal, impossible, and impracticable.” The retailer has used a similar argument with other landlords.In late October, Gap Inc. announced it would be exiting malls and closing 350 of its stores — 220 of its namesake Gap shops, and 130 Banana Republic outposts — by early 2024. The company has said 80 percent of its remaining stores will be in off-mall locations. The move came as the Gap has attempted to reinvent itself, focusing predominantly on outlets and e-commerce.Macy’s has followed a similar playbook. The recent decision to shutter its 170,000-square-foot store at Water Tower Place was months in the making. Macy’s is also moving to smaller stores along with larger fulfillment centers for online shoppers.In addition to the two locations that will not reopen, the Gap previously announced it would shutter its 28,000-square-foot store at 555 North Michigan Avenue, also along the Mag Mile. That will close later this month, Crain’s reported.A spokesperson for the company said it was “looking thoughtfully at our real estate to support the best path forward.” [Crain’s] — Alexi FriedmanAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1740 North Sheffield Avenue

That said, we have about 38 buildings under contract scheduled to close already.Noah Birk: The buildings that we sell in the South and West Side are lower price points and it’s in a high velocity area. We’ve seen a huge push from people around the country kind of flocking to Chicago because of the high cap rates that you see here versus New York. New York buyers have probably been the heaviest buyers in the Chicago market lately. The price points here in Chicago are just so much lower than the coastal cities. So a lot of these people have been priced out of their local markets in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami. Because of that they’re venturing outside of the cities that they’ve been playing in for a while. The areas where we specialize in the South and West Side of Chicago tend to have the highest cap rates at a lower price.Aaron Sklar: Unlike a lot of the other markets, Chicago does not have any rent control, which has been another catalyst that is pushing people out of California, New York and into one of the largest cities in the country.Aaron Sklar: We have a number of bids and offers on all of our listings. But when you’re selling an investment property, there’s more variables and factors to consider than just the price. What makes one buyer’s terms better than the other, sometimes it’s about track record. What has that developer done for the neighborhood? It’s us working with the sellers and buyers to find out who the best buyer ultimately is going to be.Aaron Sklar: Rents are slowly trickling up. The South and West Side of Chicago are still very affordable places to live. Given the tight supply of housing, rents are certainly not aggressively being pushed up to the point where people cannot afford it. I wouldn’t say there’s any displacement going on unnecessarily where people are and higher renters are coming in. But I think it’s a healthy correction where numbers are slowly trickling up while still being affordable.Noah Birk: Rents are somewhat of a lagging indicator to the housing market. Everybody’s seeing the housing market just exploding and prices on single family homes going through the roof. A lot of people have been priced out, not being able to buy a house. Because of that, the supply of renters has continued to go up. Demand for rental units is definitely going up. Chicago hasn’t had quite that kind of explosive rent growth. But it has been a healthy rent growth.Noah Birk: These are neighborhoods that had a lot of run-down, vacant buildings that had been just completely neglected for years. Developers have been coming through and taking these completely disheveled buildings, and just bringing them back online over the past 10 years. But even the buildings that were online and were available, weren’t really quality ones with nice finishes in these units. So we’ve seen a lot of investors coming through and just making these other buildings nice, clean, affordable, places for people to stay recently. As opposed to gentrification, what we’ve seen more on the South and West Side, is that there’s been stable, affordable, nice units coming to the market that didn’t really exist before.Noah Birk: Absolutely, I mean, that’s what we’ve seen for the last two years. It is 100% a seller’s market, there’s, there’s, you know, extreme demand for these products and low supply of them. So because of that, sellers have been able to ask pretty crazy prices and they’ve been getting it just because there are so many people that are seeking multifamily housing.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

CRG is the development arm of Clayco, and Duke’s sale was completed this week.The hires were made as CRG plans to grow by picking up existing logistics properties, with the expectation they identify deals to put about $2 billion into buying buildings over the next two to three years, said CRG President Shawn Clark. He’s bullish on the sector due to a convergence of factors, including rising interest and land costs at the same time as growing rents.“There is a unique opportunity to acquire properties at a lower basis point than we could have in the near past and still capture the rent growth that’s in the market,” Clark told the outlet.During 16 years at Duke, Crawford led the largest portfolio acquisition in the firm’s history, overseeing the $515 million deal for Chicago’s Bridge Development Partners — now Bridge Industrial. That entity had owned properties in north New Jersey, south Florida and southern California.Hawkins joined Duke’s acquisition team in 2011, and played a role in 150 purchases and developments that increased the firm’s West Coast portfolio more than sixfold to 30 million square feet.Lau, who was hired by Duke last year, will be based in CRG’s Los Angeles office, while Crawford and Hawkins will split their time between the new Indianapolis office and the headquarters in Chicago.CRG put more than $1 billion annually into industrial developments in recent years.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The business is currently overseen by Chicago Blackhawks Chairman Rocky Wirtz and includes real estate holdings on Chicago’s North Side, the United Center and an office tower in New East Side.With occupancies and rents on the rise for suburban apartments, owners have been able to sell similar properties for sizable profits.The portfolio sale, which hasn’t officially closed yet, was a rare opportunity for an investor to buy a lot of properties within a small area in a single transaction.The properties included in the sale are a 41-unit building at 605-617 Hinman Avenue, a 39-unit property at 1000-1010 Hinman Avenue, a 40-unit building at 800-810 Michigan Avenue, an 18-unit property at 929-935 Michigan Avenue and a 26-unit building at 910-916 Judson Avenue.North Park plans to invest a total of $42.2 million in the properties, including renovations.

This will save a three-bedroom 2,750-square-foot unit about $9,600 a year. Homeowners in the building such as Michael Rosenblub, who is also a Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices KoenigRubloff Realty Group agent, told Crain’s he’s hoping “this could jump-start sales” with the six listings he has at the building units he represents.Units in the building, which has $28 million in reserves, have sat stale on the market. Crain’s found that 12 condos at the building at 835 North Michigan Ave. which sold this year spent an average of 202 days on the market.With the exception of some pricey new condo towers, it has been a tough year for the residential market. Home sales earlier this year fell by almost 10 percent in the Chicago metro area and fell by 13 percent in Chicago itself, according to the RE/MAX Chicago Housing Report.But it hasn’t been all that bad for the Mag Mile condo building. Earlier this year, co-founder of Vivid Seats Eric Vassilatos wanted to combine six units in the tower to assemble a 14,000-square-foot luxury condo. This is similar to what Oprah did in the 1990s with her 9,600-square-foot space from four condos in the building.

The move comes two months after parent company Starwood Capital Group lost control of a seven-property regional mall portfolio.The Chicago property is the nearly 1 million-square-foot Louis Joliet Mall. Starwood last made a payment on its $85 million CMBS loan in March, and is over 90 days past due. The loan went into special servicing in May.According to the latest report from Trepp, Chicago-based Starwood Retail is in negotiations for a deed in lieu of foreclosure or a foreclosure sale.It has been a rough couple of years for the Joliet Mall, which is about 40 miles southwest of Chicago. One of its anchors, Carson’s, closed in 2018 and a year later, the Sears there shut down. The 40-year-old mall’s surviving anchor retailers, JCPenney and Macy’s, are facing severe problems of their own.The mall was last appraised at $131.8 million in 2012, when Starwood Retail acquired it and the Chicago Ridge Mall as part of a larger deal. Barclays provided the $85 million loan in 2012, records show.The Joliet Mall loan is part of CMBX 6, a mortgage derivative index that is heavily exposed to debt tied to retail and mall loans. It has become a popular way for investors such as Carl Icahn to short regional shopping malls.Starwood declined to comment through a spokesperson.As the pandemic has stretched into months, more owners have sought to give up on struggling malls, especially those with CMBS debt that is tricky to restructure because of covenants the servicers have with bondholders.

Wacker Drive and iManage CEO Neil Araujo (Credit: Google Maps)A Chicago tech firm that works in the cloud is looking for room to grow, albeit closer to street level.Cloud-based document management-tech company iManage is negotiating a lease deal for 80,000 square feet at Irvine Company’s office tower at 71 S. Wacker Drive, according to Crain’s.Should the deal happen, iManage would leave its 48,000-square-foot space at 540 W. Madison St in the West Loop, a venture led by Florida-based Third Millennium Group and New York investor David Werner.According to Crain’s, iManage would lease part of the 145,000-square-foot block left behind by Goldman Sachs as it moves to higher floors at Irvine’s 1.75 million-square-foot tower, formerly known as the Hyatt Center.Irvine, based in Long Beach, California, has been trying to repopulate the office property since the hotel company left in 2017. The tower was 86 percent leased last year, according to Crain’s.IManage’s departure isn’t a huge one for Third Millennium. The investors, who landed a $400 million refinancing in 2016, were able to ink anchor tenant Bank of America to a big extension and expansion to 405,000 square feet. Other tenants include DRW, SAC Wireless, Caterpillar and BMW.The list of other tech companies that have expanded in Chicago in the last year includes Google, Uber and Lyft, though their real estate preference tends toward new product in Fulton Market.

News of the New York firm’s plan to buy the 40-story building from Manulife John Hancock for $310 million surfaced in September.The deal on the 36-year-old tower officially closed last week, according to Cook County records.Roughly 70 percent of the Blackstone loan went to the acquisition, with the remaining 30 percent — $93 million — earmarked for improvements, said 601W Principal Mark Karasick.The building is nearly 25 percent vacant, well above the average vacancy rate for Downtown and up from nearly 15 percent when Manulife bought it in 2015.“We’ve got a lot of leasing to do,” he said.601W plans a number of changes to tenant amenities, including an updated lounge and conference center. The biggest and most expensive project will be replacing the tinted glass that is part of the Helmut Jahn-designed facade, which Karasick said would likely be unpopular with potential tenants.“We’re going to make it more light-friendly,” he added.601W has embarked on similar facelifts at other Chicago properties, including Prudential Plaza, which it sold earlier this year to Chicago developer Sterling Bay for $680 million.601W is also in the middle of a $185 million overhaul at the Aon Center that includes plans for an exterior elevator and observatory.Its biggest reclamation project in Chicago is the ongoing conversion of the hulking, long-vacant Old Main Post Office into 2.8 million square feet of new office space.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1 South Wacker Drive

The buyer is a wealthy Swiss investor whose name hasn’t been disclosed in public records.Dean’s company bought the building in 2015 for $14.5 million, the same year that Google opened its Midwest headquarters and set off a wave of commercial redevelopment that sent property values soaring in the former meatpacking district. Metonic didn’t respond to a request for comment.The six-story property includes 40 surface-level parking spaces, providing its new owner potential to redevelop the asset and add rentable space.The Swiss buyer paid $357 per square foot, only a bit more than a Spanish investor paid to the northeast of Fulton Market. That investor, whose identity has similarly been shielded from public records, paid $14.4 million, or $351 per square foot, in a sale-leaseback of the office lofts at 311 West Walton Street occupied by marketing firm AgencyEA, in the Near North Side.The Fulton Market building isn’t fully occupied like the Near North Side building. A listing shows a space slightly larger than 10,000 square feet is available for lease, giving the Swiss investor a chance to land a tenant and generate more rental revenue than the property yields now.The Jefferson Street building was built in 1938 and was well-known as the Schwinn Bicycle Company headquarters, with the company using the name Arnold, Schwinn, & Co. at the time, according to the lease listing.Keely Polczynski and Blake Johnson of CBRE represented Metonic in the sale.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",217 North Jefferson Street

12:57 PM","If Quintin Primo hadn’t launched a nonprofit that blazed real estate paths for Black and Latino people in 2003, Chicago’s office market within the Loop could be facing a significant gap coming out of the pandemic.","[""Quintin Primo and Thompson Center in Chicago (Linkedin, Getty, ajay_suresh/CC BY 2.0/via Wikimedia Commons)If Quintin Primo hadn’t launched a nonprofit that blazed real estate paths for Black and Latino people in 2003, Chicago’s office market within the Loop could be facing a significant gap coming out of the pandemic.Instead, the Capri Investment Group executive chairman forged a connection with Mike Tabb through the Real Estate Executive Council, the entity focused on career development in communities of color. That led to a surprising 1.2 million-square-foot commitment from Google, which plans to renovate and occupy the dilapidated Thompson Center in a move that holds the potential to give a major boost to the LaSalle Corridor in the Central Loop.Primo convinced Tabb, Google’s property guru, to sway the tech giant into purchasing the entire Thompson Center for its Chicago expansion, and allow Primo and partner Mike Reschke to undertake the massive renovation necessary for a 2026 move-in.“After a tour of four or five properties, Mike [Tabb] told me, ‘You were right about the building, the Thompson Center is the most intriguing and interesting for us but it probably has the least chance of getting done,’” Primo said. But the building’s history as a civic center and the chance for Google to change the tide of the city’s office market were the appeals that cemented the deal.While it’s being hailed as a boost for the Windy City and a bridge to the central Loop’s renaissance, Primo admits he doesn’t always win. Perhaps most notably, a fund he controlled sold the Los Angeles Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza last year after two previous scuttled deals. The property fetched $111 million, according to published reports – $25 million below the price Primo paid 15 years earlier, even after $35 million was spent on improvements. And also after it gained approval to add 1,000 apartments on the property following a long fight with the community.His attitude embodies his favorite Winston Churchill quote on defining success, “going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” The 67-year-old, who graduated from high school in Chicago’s south suburbs, sat down with The Real Deal at the Peninsula Hotel near his Gold Coast home to discuss his professional journey, his relationship with Reschke, the Google deal and more.This interview has been edited for space and clarity.We have been friends and associates for many years and we’ve looked at a lot of things to do together, many of which did not come to fruition. But we had talked about the Thompson Center a while back, as it was being speculated that the state would sell it. Mike is very active in the LaSalle corridor, and we actually worked with him on his hotel at 208 South LaSalle, providing equity financing for the entire project.[For] the Thompson Center, we had a number of meetings, and for a number of reasons we decided not to pursue it with him. I said, ‘Listen, why don’t you win it first? I don’t have a great deal of patience or tolerance for RFPs, but if you win it let’s sit down and see how we could be of assistance.’ Traditionally, we have been a capital provider, lending to Reschke and other major developers across the country. But over the last five to seven years we’ve slowly become much more of a developer making principal investments as opposed to investments on behalf of institutional clients, pension funds and others. So this transition for the firm first began at a project in Los Angeles called Baldwin Hills Crenshaw.Unfortunately the asset was in a fund and when the fund comes to the end of its natural life after agreed-to extensions, you have to sell the assets. And so we had to. A third party was hired to sell the asset. We had an interest in buying the asset ourselves, but we were not the successful bid. So we sold it.Retail malls almost without exception across the United States have suffered from the advent of the internet. So you had that headwind and Baldwin Hills was not unique in fighting that. But then on top of that, you had two to three years of the [pandemic’s] impact. We survived because we had so little leverage, and we did that purposely. We deleveraged over many years because of the uncertainty. As we talked with many prospective investors, kind of like the Thompson Center, Baldwin Hills was more than simply an asset. It was the center of the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw community in so many different ways. At Capri, we’ve always gravitated toward large, complex investments that we try to limit the downside risk and maximize the upside, so Baldwin Hills, the Thompson Center, these transactions are par for the course.Yes it is.I’ve been in the real estate industry for 43 years. I’ve seen numerous cycles. I’ve benefited in the up times and taken it on the chin from time to time. Capri, which is now in its 30th year of business, has had many failures, too many. But we’ve also had some magnificent successes. As long as the trend is generally up, even though it may have downturns, you’ll be in good shape. As we have transitioned from a traditional investment manager to a principal investor and developer, there have certainly been many challenges.Things don’t always go as planned. Who would’ve thought after having assets redeemed as a pension investment advisor, we would land one of the most significant transactions in the city and perhaps the United States?Best of luck with getting rid of that. I don’t see it disappearing and I really don’t believe it should, honestly.I think like any mayor, Mayor Lightfoot has learned on the job. Rarely do you have mayoral experience when you become a mayor. She started in the teeth of the pandemic and had to address all the economic and social issues literally from day one. But I think she’s done a magnificent job and I think she will be even better in her second term, which I am sure she will take. She brought on [Department of Planning and Development Commissioner] Maurice Cox, who I think is brilliant, and really cares about what goes on in the city. He’s very opinionated, and that’s OK. There’s no one in my business who’s not opinionated.CORRECTION, 11:35am, 9/2/2022: This story has been corrected to show Primo’s updated title in the subheadline and second paragraph.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Though the industrial market shows signs of cooling, demand still outweighs supply. The firm’s four purchases added almost 1.7 million square feet of space to the local development pipeline as tenants wait for developers to finish projects to relieve historically low supply.The firm, founded by James Martell and other former Ridge Development leaders in 2018, has developed more than 55.3 million square feet of logistics buildings since 1995, and its portfolio comprises 52 buildings across 23 million square feet in North American markets with an estimated value of more than $3 billion, according to its website.Aaron Martell, its central region executive vice president and son of the founder, previously told The Real Deal that the firm’s recent good luck with land acquisitions is a reflection of strong capital source and expertise “so that brokers believe in our ability to execute.”Vacancies in Chicago-area industrial buildings of 200,000 square feet or more rose for the first time in nearly two years last quarter, according to Colliers, showing the impact on demand of developers putting a record amount of projects in the pipeline.

The Art Van store had occupied the 71,400-square-foot building built in 1996, just east of a Target in the same shopping center.It’s the latest example of a Chicago-area big box building landing leases with legacy retailers that have been consolidating their real estate for years and changing their business models to match them to smaller spaces. Earlier this month, Macy’s leased to refill a former Carson’s that closed in 2020 in a two-story, 120,000-square-foot store in the southern suburb of Evergreen Park.It’s unclear whether Kohl’s is taking the entire building or a portion. A CBRE commercial leasing team was marketing the former Art Van space as potentially divisible into three 24,000-square-foot blocks. Neither Kohl’s nor Hubbard Street returned requests for comment.Hubbard Street’s purchase of the property in December marked its latest slide in value. Arizona’s STORE Capital had paid $12.3 million for it before Art Van closed and terminated its lease, which had about 17 years remaining as of 2019, according to a former LoopNet listing marketing the property for sale.The Schaumburg shopping strip also hosts a Dollar Tree and International Fresh Market and has Raising Cane’s chicken and Jersey Mike’s sandwich restaurants in outlot buildings.

It includes five private terraces, direct elevator access to a private on-floor lobby, and features both city and lake views, a theater room, a wine cellar, and amenities such as a humidor room, a screening room, a spa and year-round pool, maid and room service, and a four-car private garage.25 East Superior Street (Zillow)The 52-story Fordham Building at 25 East Superior Street was completed in 2003 and in River North. The listing is a rarity in the building, where other units for sale range from $385,000 to $2.7 million. Tim Salm with Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty is representing the listing and did not respond to a request for comment.It’s been a complicated time to sell and buy condos in Chicago. Two of the priciest sales to ever happen in the metro — the $20.6 penthouse sale at the St. Regis and the $20 million penthouse sale at Trump Tower — have shown the strength at the top of the condo market. But overall condo sales have lagged behind single-family home sales in a year where the pandemic has delayed return to office plans and more buyers are seeking larger spaces.The St. Regis sale closed last week — showing the strength at the top of the Chicago market even as a likely recession looms. Rising interest rates don’t hit buyers in this segment of the market often because they rarely borrow for their acquisitions nd instead pay cash.The listing joins 27 other publicly listed condos at about $7 million or above in Chicago. At the top of the market there are several major listings, including two condos at Park Tower listed by Ken Griffin at $15 million and $13.5 million, and at the Waldorf Astoria one condo is seeking $15 million and another is asking $12.5 million.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",25 East Superior Street

The 5,700-square-foot condo has four bedrooms, five bathrooms and two balconies.The sale follows a slew of recently closed deals at the tower, including one at $6 million and two at almost $9 million each. It’s also the third priciest sale in Chicao this year, only bested by the $20 million sale at the Trump International Hotel & Tower and a $17.4 million sale at No. 9 Walton.Laura England, an agent with Compass, represented the buyers, who are not yet identified in public records.“What I loved about it is that it’s lakeshore east, it’s this really cool pocket that is kind of hidden and tucked away, but close to everything,” England said.The privacy and views attracted the buyers, who England said initially considered the building for several investment property units. She said the price tag didn’t include finishes and estimates the buyers will move in after another year of construction finishing the apartment.The sale is the 55th in the Chicago area at or above $4 million this year. The pace of luxury home sales would put 2022 ahead of 2021, when a record-setting 101 homes sold in the same price range.The buyers put the property under contract in January 2021.

Ashland(Credit: Google Maps)Real estate investor Phil Denny has a problem. One of his anchor tenants, the photo and video production arm of Crate & Barrel, just left his 80,000-square-foot building on the outskirts of Fulton Market. And the $12.5 million loan on the three-story property at 240 N. Ashland Avenue recently transferred to a Miami-based special servicer, according to Crain’s.Denny, whose company Peppercorn owns about 25 properties in the West Loop and the city’s Near West Side, told Crain’s that he wasn’t worried about losing the property to a default.But if tenants at several other properties don’t pay rent in the next few months, he’ll face a serious cash crunch. “We’re preparing for a situation where the demand is so much less that it might be a challenge to carry the buildings for a prolonged period of time,” Denny, who has embraced the moniker “The King of the West Loop,” told the outlet. “That, in my opinion, warranted getting to know the special servicer and getting their opinion.”Denny’s situation could be a preview of what’s to come for many owners of commercial property in Chicago, as the economic shutdown continues to depress rental collection rates, while mortgage payments pile up, and the prospect of finding new tenants remains slim.Peppercorn bought the building in 2008 for $13 million and took a $12.5 million loan out in 2015, which was bundled with other loans as part of a commercial mortgage-backed security. Denny tried to sell the property in 2018 as an Opportunity Zone play, but found no takers.

It came on the market for $4.75 million in October and was under contract within 62 days, Crain’s reported.On average, houses priced at $2 million or more take a year to sell in the Barrington area, according to Redfin.

Since then, the price has been reduced from $29 million to nearly $15 million.In Burr Ridge, the asking price for a 30,000-square-foot-plus house once listed for $25 million has dropped to $5 million since it was relisted for nearly $11 million in 2016.

All eight buildings are scheduled to be completed by September.A Redfin listing advertises a three-bedroom, 3,100-square-foot condo at 1370 West Walton for $829,900.“This is a very special project to us because we believe that Noble Square is the next upcoming neighborhood,” Lisek wrote in an email. “We see this neighborhood becoming the next ‘hot neighborhood to be in.’”The $87 million mortgage from LoanCorp Capital is nearly seven times the nearly $13 million in total estimated construction costs registered in buildings department records for the eight properties. Lisek did not comment on what the loan proceeds will be used for.The site is one block from the Augusta Avenue exit off the expressway. It sits about a half-mile each from the Division CTA Blue Line station in Wicker Park and the Chicago station in River West.The new condos will face competition from Stas Development, which is converting the St. Boniface Catholic Church into condos one block south at 1358 West Chestnut Street.Noah lists a portfolio of nearly 100 single-family homes and 50 multifamily properties scattered across the city’s Northwest Side, especially in the Wicker Park and Ukrainian Village neighborhoods.

The pitch: early investors have the most to gain.The approach paid off for the Chicago firm, which started investing in the neighborhood in 2004. Its newest condominium project, 72 four-bedroom luxury townhomes at 311 S. Racine Avenue, sold even before construction was completed, demonstrating the area’s resilience, according to Belgravia CEO Jon McCulloch.It’s an anomaly in Chicago’s overall condo market, where units sit on the market longer and sell for lower prices than single-family homes. The West Loop is different: Home to tech companies like Google, it’s attracting both residents and commercial tenants. Some 9,000 West Loop apartments have been proposed or are in the planning stages, although rising rates may scupper some of them.Many potential buyers in the area are young families looking for larger homes, McCulloch said. The condos range from 2,160 to 3,157 square feet and have either three or four bedrooms, and include 12 four-bedroom penthouses with rooftop terraces – up from five based on demand. Prices range from $850,000 to $2.1 million. The four-bedroom condos are performing so well that the company’s next project, CAX, will have both four- and five-bedroom floor plans.Because Belgravia is offering high-end homes that aren’t priced at the top of the market, the company has had to be creative about where it builds. “When you’re kind of in more of the high mid-market space you have to find ways to push boundaries,” he said, choosing locations outside the typical boundaries of a neighborhood.McCulloch said Belgravia is evaluating where to turn next and is scouting locations on the fringe of the West Loop where they expect development to follow.The almost-completed S. Racine project, dubbed CA6, is the sixth condominium project the firm has completed in the area.

08:00 AM","Chicago office broker Matt Pistorio got his groove back on Goose Island right before the pandemic. He’s spent the past three years as a principal at developer R2 Companies, telling anyone who will listen that he can help turn the gritty industrial area once known as “Little Hell” into a thriving, diverse neighborhood.","[""“You’d have to beg for people to go over there. Now you get inquiries all the time.”Chicago office broker Matt Pistorio got his groove back on Goose Island right before the pandemic. He’s spent the past three years as a principal at developer R2 Companies, telling anyone who will listen that he can help turn the gritty industrial area once known as “Little Hell” into a thriving, diverse neighborhood.“You’d have to beg for people to go over there,” said Pistorio, who joined R2 from the brokerage Telos Group, which he co-founded in 2012. “Now you get inquiries about Goose Island all the time.”Debates have raged for decades over whether the factories and warehouses on the 160-acre landmass on the Chicago River should be replaced by multifamily housing for the wealthier people who started trickling to the city’s Near North Side in the 1980s.Now, more than three decades after then-Mayor Richard Daley pushed through its zoning as a Planned Manufacturing District, the city is about to find out whether the artificial island has outgrown that designation.Several big projects are poised to transform its southern tip. Canadian developer Onni Group is close to breaking ground on thousands of apartments that will be walking distance to River West, where Bally’s is building a $1.6 billion casino and entertainment complex.Chicago’s biggest industrial real estate players are also circling, pouring almost $200 million into the island where FedEx and Amazon and candy maker Mars, with its made-in-Chicago Wrigley’s brand, have hubs. About half that investment came from Prologis, the nation’s largest owner of industrial real estate, which bought a 340,000-square-foot warehouse at 930 West Evergreen Avenue. The property is fully leased to a logistics venture of Related Companies and Greenfield Partners, as well as a division of Mars, which broke ground this year on a $40 million research and development facility adjacent to its offices.“You have access to all the major neighborhoods and you’re close to Interstate 90,” said Jason St. John, founding partner of Greenstone Partners, a commercial brokerage whose headquarters is on the island. “That’s why Prologis did what they did with buying this site. Goose Island is a prime example of last-mile logistics, super-urban infill real estate.”Proximity to the highway doesn’t necessarily mean easy access, though. Once considered a shortcut for both north-south and east-west drivers via Halsted and Division streets, respectively, some motorists avoid Goose Island altogether due to bottlenecks. The island lacks an “L” train station, leaving public transportation to city buses that refuel on the cracked pavement of a weedy North Branch parking lot. Amenities are also scarce: There are no bars and the island’s single restaurant is the 49-year-old Goose Island Shrimp House.Goose Island is an odd place, typically associated more with the beer brand bearing its name than the island itself, which was created by William Ogden in the 1850s when he dug a canal that gave a stretch of the Chicago River a second branch and separated the island from Old Town, Cabrini-Green and the rest of the Near North Side.Named for the waterfowl kept by Irish immigrants, it was the site of power plants, a train yard and grain elevators, and began losing the residents who worked at its factories at the end of the 19th century.But its long-established industrial vibe is starting to change. R2 is turning the former Morton Salt Shed property into a 4,000-seat live performance venue. On an August evening, music from performers tuning up for a nighttime show wafted through the streets, softening the fading sun that illuminated its brick industrial structures.Workers still flowed through the streets as shifts changed at Mars, FedEx and Amazon, and the island’s recent deals are nothing if not industrial. James Martell’s Logistics Property Company paid $55 million for vacant land at 1237 West Division Street, a site just across the river that, like the Salt Shed, is referred to as “Goose Island-ish.” The developer plans the city’s first two-story warehouse on the site, a 600,000-square-foot facility.Much of the development is being driven by R2, a specialist in adaptive reuse of aging industrial buildings whose CEO, Matt Garrison, said in 2015 that he’d buy the entire island if he could. The firm has transformed properties such as 1315 North Branch Street into creative office lofts that were fully leased during the pandemic as many other Chicago buildings lost tenants and, according to Pistorio, still attract employees for in-person work. Citywide, the number of workers in offices last month was just 40 percent of pre-pandemic levels, Kastle Systems data show.The island’s industrial roots won’t disappear any time soon, even as developers march onward with plans to use old buildings for other commercial uses and try to erect new ones. It’s an approach that Pistorio said will distinguish the island’s evolution from projects such as Lincoln Yards and The 78, where Sterling Bay and Related Midwest are trying to build entirely new neighborhoods from the ground up.“It will be an eclectic mix of industrial, office and retail, which sets it up to make it a really interesting district. It will be unique. It won’t be contrived. It will be an authentic neighborhood,” Pistorio said.“It’s not a foregone conclusion”R2 is far from the only — or biggest — real estate player to have moved in on the isolated neighborhood. Houston’s Hines, which bought 1315 North Branch from R2 this year for $47 million, plans to redevelop a one-story structure into a 275,000-square-foot, six-story timber office building at Division and Cherry streets. Dubbed T3, Hines hasn’t inked a pre-lease, blaming pandemic interruptions. Reused existing buildings, by contrast, have scored deals because they’re cheaper than ground-up developments and can offer lower rents than in hot spots like Fulton Market.Not all have succeeded. The 180,000-square-foot former home of culinary school Kendall College, Goose Island’s most visible building from its southern end and a candidate for adaptive reuse, sits vacant. Kendall bought out the rest of its lease , which had options to extend through 2028, from owner W.P. Carey Group following the school’s 2019 move to Michigan Avenue.Even brokers like Colliers’ Mike Senner, who’s marketing a development site owned by Lakeview Realty that could become 77,000 square feet of office and light industrial space, isn’t sold on the island’s future as an office hub — even though it could lift the value of Lakeview’s nearby properties.“It’s not a foregone conclusion,” Senner said.Rising rents for industrial real estate and the growing need for last-mile logistics space diminish the reward associated with converting more old buildings into offices, Senner said. R2 might have made just as much money flipping 1315 North Branch without turning it into offices, and could have instead “hung gas unit heaters, sealed the floors and leased it to industrial users,” he said.Optimists say real estate and infrastructure projects will help the island’s transformation. While it’s unlikely to host upscale eateries such as the Restaurant Row establishments on Randolph Street close to Fulton Market workers, at least one is coming.Hogsalt Hospitality, which runs high-end restaurants in Chicago and New York, is working with R2 to redevelop a building and vacant land along the river known as the Goose Island Boatyard. They hope to turn the 3.5-acre former boat storage facility into an entertainment and dining destination. The city, meantime, aims to expand Division across Goose Island into a four-lane road, which may relieve traffic.Hines, led in Chicago by Will Renner and Brian Atkinson, insists there’s no need for tenants to demand easy access to retail, saying the rise of food delivery services puts a variety of options at the other end of a cell phone. They also noted that Crate & Barrel’s sister company, CB2, moved to 1315 North Branch from Fulton Market three years ago.“It’s easy to get to. It’s low-friction office space,” Renner said.For all that, Hines hasn’t put a whole lot of resources toward getting T3 off the ground. It hasn’t bought the property: Instead, it struck a deal with the family that owns it to build if it draws an office tenant, allowing Hines to sit out the project until the market improves. Hines said interest from prospective tenants has picked up this year.Pistorio remains on the hunt for opportunities, even as he acknowledges that ground-up success will be limited. He struck an agreement with W.P. Carey, the owner of the former Kendall College building, to handle leasing and plans to bring it to market soon.“You have incredible ceiling heights, and goofy spaces with garage doors — it’s not traditional office,” Pistorio said, before using a metaphor to differentiate adapted spaces from typical modern offices.“If you have a bunch of suburban tuna cans on Goose Island, it’s probably not leasing right now.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",930 West Evergreen Avenue

It bought them from the Comforte family, whose late patriarch, Victor Comforte, started Chicago’s Climatemp heating and cooling business in 1950 and ran it for decades from Fulton Market.Separately, Trammell Crow paid $23.4 million to a venture of Shapack — an early pioneer of Fulton Market — for a property at 1150 West Carroll. Less is known about the buyer’s plans for the site than the former Comforte property next door.Fulton Market property values have surged since it became a high-end office hub providing tenants an alternative to the Loop and riverfront towers. The development wave was spurred in large part by Google and McDonald’s decisions to put their workplaces in the neighborhood last decade, as the fast-food chain moved its headquarters from the suburbs. Since then, developers such as Shapack — who this spring explored a sale of 167 North Green, which could crush Chicago’s per square foot sales record if it’s bought — have turned the former meatpacking district into a live-work-play destination, adding luxury hotels to the area as well.Trammell isn’t new to the neighborhood, either. It built the life sciences lab-oriented Fulton Labs project, a pair of buildings at 400 North Aberdeen and 1375 West Fulton streets that, combined, hold more than 700,000 square feet of rentable offices and labs.The Texas firm last year gained city approval for a 410-foot, 26-story mixed-use office and commercial building at the May Street parcel, which will contain 180 parking spaces and 650,000 square feet of offices, along with 15,000 square feet of ground-floor retail. To the north at 1112 Carroll, Trammell is moving toward breaking ground on a 370-foot tall, 33-story residential building with 377 units, 90 parking spaces and ground-floor commercial space.The $550 million project was initially conceived as two office towers. Then Trammell converted the building on 1112 West Carroll to residential use after Chicago’s Plan Commission allowed such developments north of Lake Street last year.Immediately to the west, at 1150 West Carroll, Shapack is more than doubling an investment he made three years ago with his sale to Trammell, public records show. He bought the property, which includes a 37,000-square-foot industrial building on a 43,000-square-foot lot, for $11.3 million.How Trammell plans to use the property it bought from Shapack and when it might make a proposal to redevelop it are unclear.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",315 North May Street

Half of that space is now being considered for a deal with fashion retailer Primark.Some mall owners and developers are transforming their empty spaces into residential use as finding retailers becomes difficult during the pandemic, Dallas-based Centennial Real Estate is building 300-unit apartment complexes on the sites of former Sears stores in Vernon Hills’ Hawthorn Mall and Aurora’s Fox Valley Mall.Another former Sears in Six Corners is set to be redeveloped into a $90 million six-story residential development.Including the parking lot outside, the Orland Park store measures more than 16 acres, allowing for multiple redevelopment options. Seritage had reached a deal with AMC to build a 10-screen, 45,000-square-foot theater as part of a larger redevelopment plan, but plans fell through last year.The company owns several other local properties, including a former Sears in Lombard that is now leased to furniture retailer The Dump and another in Joliet that is being considered for a residential development.While Seritage owns the former Sears store, Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group owns the Orland Square Mall.[CCB] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

11:23 AM",Chicago’s luxury residential market is off to a strong start to the year.,"[""1045 Starr Lane, Winnetka (Realtor.com)Chicago’s luxury residential market is off to a strong start to the year.The Jan. 24 sale of recently retired Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith’s home for just over $4 million marks the seventh Chicago-area home to sell for at least that price, according to Crain’s. It came after 101 houses selling for at least that price last year, almost double the 51 that hit that mark in 2019.Smith and his wife, Denise Matthews-Smith, bought their seven-bedroom home on Starr Lane in Winnetka for $3.55 million in 2014. Smith, who retired in July after a 30-year career with the aerospace company, served as interim CEO after Boeing fired Dennis Muilenberg in 2019 after two 737 Max planes crashed, killing 346.Single-family home values rose 11.6% in November from the year-earlier month, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices report cited by Crain’s. That continues a streak of double digit increases that started in June. It’s the third-longest such streak dating back to the 1980s. The longest ended in August 2006.The figures show how much low interest rates and pandemic-era shifts in housing needs have bolstered the market. In the 12 months before the onset of the pandemic, Chicago-area home prices never rose more than 2 percent in a month. In the preceding five months, the increase was less than 1 percent, according to Crain’s.Nationwide, home prices rose 18.8% in November, after four months when the figure was over 19%. The series of double-digit increases kicked in earlier nationwide than in Chicago, Crain’s reported.Chicago’s price growth remained near the bottom of the list of major U.S. metropolitan areas, where it has been for much of the past four years. Only in two of the top 20 biggest metro areas did prices rise more slowly than Chicago: Washington, D.C., at 11 percent and Minneapolis, at 11.2 percent.[Crain’s] – Harrison ConneryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

But the property itself is more of the story than the volatile luxury market.Built in 2008, the 30,214-square-foot Burr Ridge mansion has seen its price steadily drop and its issues steadily increase, according to the Chicago Tribune, which first reported on the sale.The mansion flooded in 2011 after water pipes burst in its second-floor bathrooms, while the property sat vacant. Those problems were later repaired.Its most recent price chop was in early March, when it was slashed to $5 million from $6 million. The seller, Arvin Lourdenadin, had bought the house in a 2012 sheriff’s sale for $3.1 million, then fixed it up and relisted it for nearly $11 million in 2016.The listing agent for the current sale was Lisa Petrik of Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty. Petrik declined to identify the buyer but said that he “had his eye on it for a while,” according to the Tribune.Other suburban mansions have lingered on the market for years, most notably Michael Jordan’s 30,000-square-foot compound in Highland Park that was first listed in 2012 for $29 million. It is now on the market for $14.85 million, according to Redfin.

The couple bought the unit as raw space when the historic former hotel building was converted to condos in the 2000s and embarked on a two-and-a-half-year buildout resulting in an ultra-sleek, modernist interior, said listing agent Mark Icuss of Compass.“It’s one of the most striking homes I’ve ever been in,” he said. “While modern, it’s very warm.”One of two penthouse units in the Ambassador West, the Taner’s 6,000-square-foot home has five bedrooms, five bathrooms, a 1,000-square-foot outdoor terrace and a custom spiral staircase covered in Vienetian plaster. Three parking spots in a heated garage are included with the unit. The listing went live on Wednesday.Britt Taner handled the interior design — she owns a design firm, according to a feature on the pop-art-adorned home in Luxe. Her husband, Kerim Taner, owns an investment firm. The unit was lightly lived in, Icuss said, as the couple spends time between multiple other properties.If the unit trades at its near-$8 million asking price, it would be the second priciest home sale of the year, trailing only an $11.3 million buy in No. 9 Walton. Icuss said the sale could be one of the top three priciest sales of the year, depending on how listings like the $13.5 million unit at 840 North Lake Shore Drive fare on the current market.After a banner year for the luxury market in 2018, this year’s market has slowed considerably with sales of $1 million or more dropping 22 percent year over year. The drop is even more pronounced in the Downtown condo market.The popularity of new high-end developments like JDL Development’s No. 9 Walton and Related Midwest’s One Bennett Park have hurt the market for older luxury condo units, market experts have previously told The Real Deal.While some luxury condo listings are languishing, Icuss said the owners’ extensive renovation of the unit will be of benefit to the listing, as it will require no overhauling by a new owner.The Ambassador’s other penthouse sold previously for $7 million, but it required a multimillion-dollar rehab, Icuss said.“It definitely stands out against a lot of old, dated condo inventory out there,” Icuss said. “There’s a market for a product that is turn-key, move-in ready.

Almeida and 1 Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, IL (Google Maps, Baxter)Another sprawling suburban Chicago office complex is for sale, with its redevelopment potential being advertised.Medical products giant Baxter International has hired JLL to market its 101-acre, 10-building campus at 1 Baxter Way in Deerfield while the company searches for new office space in the Chicago area, Crain’s reported earlier. No asking price is listed for the property, which totals 646,000 square feet of buildings developed in the 1970s.Like other companies long headquartered in suburban Chicago, Baxter wants to modernize its workplace to keep employees interested in coming into offices after working from home during the pandemic. Many of the company’s employees have chosen hybrid work schedules consisting of some days in the office and some working from home, a spokesman for the company told Crain’s.The move to sell the property marks the latest large swath of corporate offices in the Chicago suburbs to hit the market with loads of redevelopment potential. Last year, Allstate put its 232-acre headquarters in Northbrook on the market and made a $232 million deal to sell it to Nevada industrial developer Dermody Properties. That company plans to demolish the office buildings and build 3.2 million square feet of warehousing.JLL is also emphasizing the redevelopment prospects of Baxter’s property. Industrial developers are increasingly on the hunt for land since rents in that sector have exploded in the Chicago area and across the nation.Suburban Chicago offices, meanwhile, have been falling out of favor for years, and have been prevented from recovering by the pandemic.Suburban office vacancies sit at a record-high of 26 percent with 25 million square feet of unleased space across the suburbs, according to the brokerage Cresa. The northwest and north suburban submarkets are leading the way with the most vacancy, with respective vacancy rates of 33 percent and 25 percent.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

But like many other older suburban homes, it had a hard time moving in today’s housing market.“The feedback was it’s such a special house, but there were areas that were just not considered’ in previous renovations, McCurry said.After the home failed to find a buyer, homeowners Susan Shipper-Smith and Ted Smith decided to pull the listing and continue renovating it, including upgrading the bedrooms, McCurry said.“Once you vacate a property, all the blemishes come out,” he said. “They took it off and prepared it for the market.”The Avery Coonley Playhouse was constructed in 1912 as a schoolhouse. The name “playhouse” comes from the school’s mission of education through theater and other performing arts; its grand hall contained a stage.Industrialist Avery Coonley and wife Queene Ferry Avery had the school built on their estate, which featured a mansion designed by Wright and other structures. When the family moved to Washington, D.C. in 1917, the playhouse was turned into a mansion.Turning the school into a home has been a work in progress ever since, McCurry said. The current owners have labored for years to make it more livable, including turning what was essentially a storage area into a family room.The home contained some of the Wright’s most celebrated window designs, including school-appropriate stained-glass balloons, confetti and flags. Many of the original windows were sold off, with some hanging in museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The Smiths have worked to replace this windows with reworkings of the Wright designs.“The replacements are museum-grade, too,” McCurry said. “They sought out the best makers they could.”Despite the renovations, the home hits the market this week with a $50,000 price cut over its previous listing, and is now asking $750,000. Accepting price cuts is not uncommon in the higher-end suburban market, which is dealing with an abundance of inventory and a lack of younger buyers, who are putting off buying or choosing to live in the city.Not even historic homes are spared. The Wright-designed home on the Coonley estate sold in February for $1.2 million, after eight years on the market and an original listing price of $2.9 million, Crain’s reported at the time. In early 2018, a Glencoe home designed by Wright sold for $752,000 after being listed at $800,000.Despite the slumping market, McCurry said the playhouse should fare well. Most available homes don’t have the history and significance of the Smiths’ listing, he said.“It shows really well now,” McCurry said. “A buyer will be able to own a piece of history, and also be able to live there.”The listing went live on a private network Wednesday and will hit the MLS by Friday, he said..All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",350 Fairbank Road

12:49 PM",There’s a gold rush in Chicago’s Bronzeville neighborhood.,"[""4559 S Prairie Ave (Zillow)There’s a gold rush in Chicago’s Bronzeville neighborhood.More new houses sold in the South Side community, a historically significant area for the city’s Black community, than any other neighborhood last year, Crain’s reported. That’s due to an influx of residents looking for affordability they can’t find elsewhere without sacrificing access to the city’s downtown and lakefront.But the way in which the neighborhood is gentrifying may not push out many current residents and could become a model for other areas.“It’s one of the last places in Chicago where you can get a new, 4,000-square-foot house for under $1 million,” Michaela Gordon, an @properties agent who sold a new, 3,600-square-foot house for $815,000 on 42nd Street in December, told Crain’s. “It has a variety of quintessential old Chicago architecture, and you’re not displacing anyone.”The median home price in Bronzeville last year was over $550,000, Crain’s reported, citing Chicago Association of Realtors data. That’s higher than some North Side neighborhoods like Avondale and Portage Park. The city-wide median is $318,000.What makes Bronzeville’s transition different from other places in Chicago where gentrification displaced longtime residents, such as Pilsen and the 606 trail area, is that the neighborhood has thousands of vacant lots caused by years of disinvestment, according to Crain’s. Developers who once viewed them as eyesores that depressed home values in the area are now rushing to develop them. That’s lifting the area’s housing and income profile without driving residents away.Bronzeville had more than 3,000 vacant lots at the start of the century. Many of those have been redeveloped since 2017, with more than 250 houses sold for $500,000 or more, according to Crain’s.The pandemic may be helping homes sell in the neighborhood, which has been slow to attract amenities like the restaurants and cafes that usually pop up in a hot housing market.“You don’t expect to walk down the street for coffee, for dinner,” Sheila Dantzler, a Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty agent, told Crain’s. “You expect to be home, in your house or in your yard.”More high-end development is on the way. A set of five homes priced in the $950,000-range will come on the market later this year. Coldwell Banker Paulette Edwards, who has experience selling homes in Bronzeville, told Crain’s she is “absolutely confident” the demand is there.With prices rising so quickly, some prospective buyers are already priced out of the neighborhood. Dantzler said Fuller Park, to Bronzeville’s west, could be the next place to attract affordable new development.“A lot of people who could afford Bronzeville two years ago at $600,000 can’t afford it now at over $700,000,” Dantzler told Crain’s. “The prices have gone up so high in a short time frame.”\n“Read\n\n\n\nMixed use development to bring housing and retail to Bronzeville\nBronzeville investors hope to capitalize on megaproject at Michael Reese site\nBrothers decide against Bronzeville deconversion[Crain’s] – Harrison ConneryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",4559 S Prairie Ave

California in North Center.If approved, the development would bring new housing to the aged northwest side neighborhood off Addison Street at a time when demand has grown and the multifamily market seems to be snapping back, according to JLL’s last housing market outlook.Lexington, a prolific family-owned homebuilder, is looking to develop three-story townhomes on the northern portion of the site and a six-story, horseshoe-shaped apartment complex on Addison with a river-facing courtyard, the report said.The property, which was renamed DePaul College Prep in 2014 as part of a rebranding of what was once the male-only Catholic Gordon Tech high school, was sold in 2019. DePaul College Prep, which has an alliance with DePaul University, relocated last year to a new 17-acre campus in nearby Roscoe Village.The development, which connects to the Riverview Bridge adjacent to the new DePaul College Prep campus, also includes 391 parking spaces and 3,000 square feet of retail space.The report also noted the plans come ahead of a new law that will raise the numbers of affordable housing units developers will be required to include in apartment projects that goes into effect Oct. 1.

Atlanta-based Wood Partners, which developed the property, listed the building for sale in February.Few large multifamily buildings downtown have changed hands recently, making it difficult to value them.The price, equivalent to about $363,000 per unit, or $459 per square foot, was well below the $600 per square foot it would cost to construct a building of the same size.It was the biggest downtown apartment sale since Chicago landlord Waterton in December paid $209 million, or $344,000 per unit, for The Tides at Lakeshore East.Alta Roosevelt, opened in 2017, is 95 percent occupied. Rents range from $2,091 a month for a studio to $4,351 for a three-bedroom. Average rents amount to about $3.34 per square foot, up more than 8 percent from a year ago.American Landmark’s holdings include Schaumburg Towers and the Illinois Science & Technology Park in Skokie. It’s mostly invested in office properties over the years. The firm also owned a stake in the Willis Tower before it was sold to Blackstone Group for $1.3 billion in 2015.Class A rents in downtown Chicago jumped by almost a fifth in the first quarter to an average of $3.55 a square foot.

White, who blurred the woman’s face, said he uploaded the video to Tik Tok to raise awareness of the practice. The apartment was owned by a bank rather than the fake landlord she’d been dealing with. The woman was evicted.This type of rental scam is a product of the pandemic, with an increase in vacant properties, many of which weren’t being watched. A fake landlord will break into an empty home or apartment building, switch the locks and advertise the property online under a fake business name. A tenant will move in, sign a lease and begin payments only to find out their money had not gone toward rent. Those tenants then often face eviction and the scammer is gone.White told the Sun Times that he encounters this type of fraud eight to 10 times a week in this work.When such scams are revealed, ideally a deal can be worked out, since the real landlord now has an available tenant in the building if they want one, Chicago attorney Richard Magnone, who represents property owners in court and writes a blog for landlords, told the Sun Times.“Working with them to make them a tenant is not a horrible idea, because they, too, are victims,” he said.Sam Clendenning, a community organizer with the Metropolitan Tenants Organization, recommended a citywide rental registry that would enable tenants to easily check who owns a building before signing a lease.

Michigan Avenue in Downtown ChicagoGoldman Sachs has pulled funding from Chicago’s largest active condominium project, the $470 million tower at 1000 S. Michigan Avenue.The construction lender has put the 74-story tower on ice until it assesses the real estate market’s strength in September, the Chicago Tribune reported.The bank is “concerned about economic stability of the market at this particular time due to recent events,” said Francis Greenburger, whose firm Time Equities is co-developing the Helmut Jahn-designed tower alongside New York-based JK Equities and Oak Capitals.In June, Crain’s reported that construction work on 1000M’s foundation had stopped, apparently the first high-rise to fall victim to the economic uncertainty caused by Covid-19. The developers issued a statement at the time that claimed construction had stopped due to safety concerns, not financial issues.Goldman Sachs covered the cost of the first phase of the foundation but hasn’t released funds to continue working, Greenburger told the Tribune. It’s unclear how much has been spent on the 840-foot tower, though the developers are exploring other means of financing the construction before the September review.Greenburger told the Tribune that 101 of 421 units were in contract, with buyers having put 10 percent down. Those buyers are being offered half of their deposits back, though Greenburger told the newspaper that many declined.Several other notable projects in Chicago have been delayed because of Covid-19, which has sent Chicago’s unemployment rate soaring. At least 450,000 workers in the Chicago metro area have lost their jobs in the last year, according to statistics from the Illinois Bureau of Labor. Construction of Uber’s office space in the Old Post Office development has been delayed, as has the planned observatory at the Aon Center.Greenburger and his partners bought the condo site for $17.2 million in 2016. Some of the units were reconfigured last year into micro-units to spur sales. Prices range from $476,000 for studios to $8.5 million for the penthouse.

The building, Chicago’s third tallest, is also the headquarters for major companies like commercial brokerage JLL, public relations firm Edelman, and food conglomerate Kraft Heinz.New York-based 601W Companies bought the tower from Piedmont Office Realty Trust for $713 million in 2015, and received approval for an $185 million overhaul of the property in 2018 — including plans for a “thrill ride” on the observation deck that will dangle passengers over the edge of the roof in a glass-bottomed enclosure.Months before the Chicago Plan Commission approved that renovation, 601W secured a $678 million refinancing of the property, of which $400 million was securitized in a single-asset CMBS transaction named JPMCC 2018-AON. Documents associated with that deal provide an inside look at the tower’s finances.As of May 2018, the 1.75 million-square-foot property was 88 percent leased to 52 tenants, with five of the top 10 using the building as either their global or American headquarters.Aon is still the top tenant with 15 percent of rentable space, while big four accounting firm KPMG is the second with more than 300,000 square feet. KPMG first moved to the Aon Center in 2009, and has since expanded its lease several times — most recently adding a floor for a big data-centric “Ignition Center” in 2019. The fifth-largest tenant, Edelman, was reported last year to be in talks to leave Aon Center for Sterling Bay’s 111 North Canal Street, but that deal did not close.On average, tenants at the Aon Center pay base rent in the low $20s per square foot. The priciest major lease at the building is for insurance company Kemper Corporation, which moved its headquarters to the property in 2018 and pays about $25 per square foot.Occupancy at the tower has risen above 90 percent since the refinancing, as insurance company Health Care Services Corporation inked a 65,000-square-foot lease across two floors in early 2019.601W, led by Michael Silberberg and Mark Karasick, is also the owner of the Old Post Office building which opened its doors to tenants last fall, following two decades out of service and an $800 million overhaul.The company recently pulled off the biggest single-asset acquisition since the pandemic began, paying $952.5 million for SL Green’s 410 Tenth Avenue, an Amazon-anchored office building in Manhattan’s Hudson Yards neighborhood. The hefty price tag was widely viewed as a positive signal for New York’s investment sales market, which has had a dearth of deals in recent months.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",200 East Randolph Street

12:27 PM","Chicago’s two-, three- and four-flat buildings are dwindling amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and with it renters are losing a staple of the city’s affordable housing market.","[""(iStock)Chicago’s two-, three- and four-flat buildings are dwindling amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and with it renters are losing a staple of the city’s affordable housing market.A recent study from the American Bar Foundation and the University of Illinois Chicago found that some smaller building landlords — who had previously been flexible and accommodating for renters struggling to make ends meet — were tightening rental requirements or considering selling their buildings altogether, the Chicago Tribune reports.The study found that independently-owned rental properties make up a substantial portion of the non-subsidized affordable housing market in the city. Historically, those landlords have accommodated tenants by limiting rent increases and offering flexibility on late payments, according to the study.The researchers interviewed 51 Chicago landlords with small properties. Ten of those interviewed said they would raise rents and further screen tenants.“When landlords take these shifts to more rigid approaches, they end up passing the risks of this crisis, the financial crisis, onto tenants,” researcher Allison Suppan Helmuth told the Chicago Tribune.The most recent report matches a 2021 study from the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University that showed Chicago’s two-, three- and four-flats were disappearing and are typically replaced with a single-family residence or an empty lot, not additional rental housing, according to the Tribune.“This sector of the rental market is really important because: one, it is more affordable, and two, there’s an understanding, somewhat supported by previous research, that landlords have these more flexible, lenient, tenant-friendly practices in this sector,” researcher Anna Reosti said.Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, a nonprofit homeownership organization, is concerned with the study’s findings. The organization has been partnering with other community organizations to preserve and renovate two- and four-flats across Chicago.Experts recommend formalizing a lease, which can help both tenants and landlords.

08:00 AM",Chicago developer Fred Latsko unveiled a rendering of the apartment tower on tap to accompany the nation’s second Guinness brewery planned for Fulton Market.,"[""Fred Latsko and 375 North Morgan Street (LinkedIn, Renderings via Fred Latsko)Chicago developer Fred Latsko unveiled a rendering of the apartment tower on tap to accompany the nation’s second Guinness brewery planned for Fulton Market.The project at 375 North Morgan Street is on the west portion of the site where the brewery, announced in September 2021, is under construction. Latsko said he has been working with the city’s Committee on Design on a plan for the building to rise nearly 40 stories. It will include more than 500 apartment units “with loads of green space,” Latsko said.It’s another glass high-rise planned for Fulton Market, a neighborhood with a fast-growing office supply that has experienced a surge in its residential development in the pipeline of late. Latsko initially pitched his project as a 33-story office tower but pivoted to apartments amid the pandemic.The Guinness brewery and taproom is projected to open by St. Patrick’s Day of next year. It follows the Irish beer company’s first location stateside in Maryland. The business signed a multi-year lease for the 15,000-square-foot space, which Latsko also owns.The project’s apartment units add to the West Loop’s residential development boom. The area had more than 9,000 units planned or under construction – more than the rest of downtown Chicago neighborhoods combined – as of March. Much of that development is in Fulton Market, where both apartments and offices are in demand.27th Ward Alderman Walter Burnett’s decision to lift a ban on residential zoning in Fulton Market in April 2021 preceded many of those proposals.Another recently announced project for Fulton Market is emerging developer Joy Jordan’s 17-story mixed-use tower on Sangamon Street, a glass and metal-paneled building that will include office and retail space. That project will be located directly across from the Guinness brewery.Construction on Sterling Bay’s first multifamily project in Fulton Market is also underway at 160 North Morgan Street, where the firm is building a 30-story, 282-unit apartment and more than 2,600 square feet of retail space. The firm cited Fulton Market’s pipeline of incoming corporate headquarters and the need for more multifamily options for a young, modern workforce as the factors that supported the project.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",375 North Morgan Street

Vi will move from its current location at Irvine Company’s 71 South Wacker Drive to the skyscraper at 233 South Wacker Drive early next year.The new lease comes as Blackstone Group continues work on its $668 million redevelopment of the historic Chicago skyscraper. New amenities in the building will include a 30,000-square-foot fitness center, a cafe and lounge on the 33rd floor and a food hall. The building’s renovated lobby was unveiled to the public this week.Vi Chief Financial Officer Gary Smith said in a statement the Willis Tower improvements will help the firm recruit and retain employees.“The building, as well as the highly desired Loop location, is exactly what we were looking for in our new space,” he said.The new lease continues a hot streak for Blackstone, which bought the Willis Tower for $1.3 billion in 2015, the most expensive office transaction outside of New York City.Earlier this year, United Airlines announced it would remain at the Willis Tower until at least 2023. Taking more than 850,000-square-feet in the tower, United is the largest single-space, private office tenant in the city.In December, electronics manufacturer Molex inked a 20,000-square-foot lease in the Willis Tower, bringing its occupancy to 94 percent. A spokesperson for Blackstone’s office management company declined Tuesday to provide an updated occupancy figure.Representing Vi in the new lease deal were Savills’ Lisa Davidson and Joe Learner. Savills’ Rich Dale and Loredana Perri will advise the firm on its office build-out.

That deal saw WeWork take five floors at 515 State Street and two floors of the AMA Plaza building at 330 North Wabash Avenue.Alter in 2015 sold the home of another WeWork location, 111 West Illinois Street, to Munich-based GLL Partners for $75 million, according to Crain’s.The building at 20 West Kinzie once was Google’s Chicago home until it moved into a new headquarters in Fulton Market developed by Sterling Bay. The first six floors of the building are occupied by the 215-key Kinzie Hotel, which is owned by Bixby Bridge Capital.The building would be the second WeWork-occupied building to sell recently, after German investor Commerz Real bought the National building at 125 South Clark Street from Blue Star Properties for $202 million.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",20 West Kinzie Street

The unit has five bedrooms across 6,400 square feet and still has some of the original finishes from an original 1917 design by David Adler and Henry Dangler.The condo has bookcases, fireplaces, columns and decorative molding on top of a checkerboard marble tile and herringbone-patterned wood floor that date back to when Emily Ryerson lived there. It takes up the first and second floors of the four-story building and has terraces on three sides, the longest of which faces a park across the street.2700 North Lakeview Avenue (VHT Studios)While some original features took time to fix, the owners didn’t want to “rip anything out,” said Wendy Berg, a Baird & Warner agent representing the condos. The other unit, which has been on the market since January with an asking price of $5.65 million, didn’t retain many of the historical details and essentially got a new interior entirely.The 16,000-square-foot home was built by Emily Ryerson and her three children after they fled the Titanic in a lifeboat while traveling home for the funeral of another son, a Yale student who had been killed in a car accident. Her husband, Arthur Ryerson, was among about 1,500 people who lost their lives.The Ryerson mansion is one of several Georgian row homes that Adler and Dangler designed near the 2700 North Lakeview Avenue property.The mansion, which hasn’t been a residential property since 1946, housed the addiction recovery and mental health facility Thresholds since 1975.While most of the interior had been divided into small, dormitory-style rooms and the living room had been used as a basketball court, many features survived years of rough living.[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","2700 North Lakeview Avenue (Encyclopedia Titanica, VHT St"

The affordable units will cost about $52 million.“The tax savings help to partially offset the cost of the affordable component of the project, making it possible to provide these units, but by no means results in a financial windfall,” said Liz Butler, the zoning attorney for the project.Mayor Lori Lightfoot introduced the tax ordinance, the first to give tax incentives to developers building multi-family projects in “low-affordability communities” or areas where 40 percent or less of the total housing units are affordable. A 2019 analysis found that only 20 percent of housing in the O’Hare area is affordable for households earning 60 percent of the local median income.Approval of the Glenstar project broke the city’s longstanding tradition of letting the local alderperson have final say over developments in their wards. Alderman Anthony Napolitano, whose district includes the area, wanted to build a commercial development instead. He denied that he opposed the project because of the affordable housing.At a committee meeting before the City Council, Napolitano said the decision to approve the development against his wishes tells residents that their voices won’t be heard. Mayor Lightfoot says housing is at the heart of the city’s segregation and the new development will help workers at O’Hare Airport.“This is a time to not just think about your own interests; it’s time to think about the city’s interests,” Lightfoot said. “It’s critical for us to make a statement about affordability and where it can be located.”[BCC] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",8723 West Higgins Road

The building opened last year.At the time it opened last summer, Vista on the Park was one of few ground-up apartment developments to take shape in rapidly-gentrifying Humboldt Park, where home prices have skyrocketed since 2017. The building’s paneled design and rooftop amenities mimic the parade of new high-end apartment developments rising along the Milwaukee Avenue corridor to the east and north.Each unit also includes a private balcony and in-unit laundry, according to Kyle Stengle, senior director of Marcus & Millichap’s multifamily and mixed-use group. The amenities, combined with more spacious apartments than are found in most comparable new apartment buildings, helped fill the building within months of its opening, he said.The building includes one- and two-bedroom apartments measuring between 875 and 1,310 square feet, with rents ranging from $1,931 to $3,605 per month.Senne paid $915,000 in 2015 to buy the property from investor Neil Freeman, according to Cook County property records. Two years later, while construction was underway on the six-story residential complex, Senne secured a $7.7 million loan on the property from Park Ridge Community Bank.In order to bring the development in line with the city’s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, Senne also built a small apartment building with a trio of three-bedroom units at 1411 North Fairfield Avenue, about a half-mile away. Those apartments rent at $1,270 per month and are being marketed for sale together with the North Avenue property, according to the brochure.The site lies inside the city’s Milwaukee affordability pilot zone, where any new residential proposal needs to set aside 15 percent of its units as affordable in order to secure zoning approval. Since Senne began construction before the pilot zone went into effect in November 2017, his proposal did not trigger the requirements.Stengle and Austin Weisenbeck of Marcus & Millichap also brokered the sale of Senne’s Maynard mixed-use building at 2934 North Milwaukee Avenue in 2015. CLK Properties ultimately bought that property for $6.1 million in 2015, property records show.In both cases, the breadth of banks willing to offer financing at relatively low interest rates presented a “good opportunity to sell the asset,” Stengle said.Vista on the Park is about two blocks east of the 207-acre Humboldt Park and two blocks south of the 606 Trail, where property values have spiked especially hard. Local Alderman Roberto Maldonado (26th) recently introduced a series of ordinances to downzone properties near the trail as a way of slowing the frenzy of new development, but the measures reportedly stalled in the City Council on Wednesday.Senne did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2635 West North Avenue

03:12 PM",The developer of a Waukegan condo building sold more than three-quarters of the building’s units for $4.1 million.,"[""3370 West Brooke Avenue and Kiser Group brokers Danny Mathis and Matt Halper (Kiser Group, Getty)The developer of a Waukegan condo building sold more than three-quarters of the building’s units for $4.1 million.Jim Onan, who built Onan Place Condos in 2006, sold 58 of the building’s 74 units to an undisclosed buyer. Onan appears to be the seller based on prior reporting in the Lake County News-Sun. A news release about the deal stating that Kiser Group’s senior director Matt Halper and director Danny Mantis represented the seller did not identify Onan.“The unique thing about this deal is it’s a bulk condo deal rather than the far more common condo deconversion,” Halper said in a statement.Though condo deconversions have been on the upswing since 2015, steadily transforming much of Illinois’ condo stock into rentals, the owner of the majority of the units did not want to market the sale as a deconversion despite owning more than the 75 percent required under state law, according to Kiser.All of the units included in the sale are currently rented to tenants, giving the property an in-place cap rate of 6.3 percent, the brokerage said.Mantis cited the strength of the far north suburban market and said the area has been seeing strong investor interest from outside Waukegan in recent years.“The buyer of this property comes into a situation with several options,” he said in a statement. “They will have the opportunity to continue to operate the condo chunk as the seller has and organically raise rents and also will have the opportunity to acquire additional units over time.”The condo building is among the newest housing stock in the area.Joseph Rominski, an attorney representing Onan, told the Lake County News-Sun in May the condo units had been slow to sell a decade ago so the Onan family began renting them out. Onan reportedly found a buyer for the 58 units last year, but a conditional use permit not allowing the rental of units caused the sale to be delayed.Some individual condo owners in the building objected to allowing the units to be rented, fearing that the building would become an all-rental community and displace owners if the property was sold.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",3370 West Brooke Avenue

The global restaurant chain finalized its corporate relocation to Fulton Market from suburban Oak Brook earlier this year.Companies with suburban headquarters like Caterpillar, Sears Holding Corp. and Allstate have all launched satellite offices Downtown as a way to interest a younger demographic of employees who have increasingly moved back into the city.Demand for Downtown office space has risen sharply this decade, jumping from an average of $31.69 per square foot in 2010 to $39.41 this year, according to commercial real estate firm CBRE.McDonald’s and Google’s new corporate offices in Fulton Market have inspired hundreds of millions of dollars in office development in the West Loop, as other businesses look to follow their lead.Last month, Shapack Partners leased furniture manufacturer Knoll to three floors inside the developer’s new 70,000-square-foot office building at 811 West Fulton Street.And more recently, Mark Goodman & Associates unveiled a proposal for a 12-story office building around the corner from the Google and McDonald’s offices.And prolific Fulton Market Developer Sterling Bay plans 1.7 million square feet of new office space in four new buildings on Green and Morgan Streets.Chicago remains in the running for Amazon’s HQ2, which could bring up to 50,000 high-skilled tech jobs wherever it lands.

It showed yet more evidence of Cook County’s rapidly-falling stock of apartments that are affordable to middle- and low-income renters — a trend driven in large part by a purge of walk-up rental buildings.But it also found a decline in high-income renters, a sharp reversal from previous years and an apparent rebuke of everything real estate pros say they’ve noticed about the city’s demographic and economic shifts.For the first time in at least a decade, the county saw a decline in the number of renter households that earn more than 120 percent of area median income, or about $82,000. The number fell from 187,230 in 2016 to 170,381 in 2017, the last year analyzed, a decline of roughly 9 percent.The number of high-income renters is still far above where it was before the 2008 housing crisis, which drove tens of thousands of Chicago-area residents all across the income spectrum away from homeownership. But the 2017 data could show that trend is finally starting to turn, with a slight increase in the number of owner-occupied households across the county. That figure had steadily dropped from 2007 to 2015.“We’re seeing a shift in the demographic groups that have been key drivers of rental demand during the recovery, which is high-income renters and millennials,” said Sarah Duda, deputy director of the institute and the study’s lead author. “Higher-income households have a lot more choice, and they’re more mobile, so they may be taking that opportunity to switch to homeownership.”The report used Census data and other public records to calculate renter demand. In addition to the reduction in high-income renters, it also showed a decline in renters age 55 and younger, with an especially sharp drop in the 25-34 age group.Duda cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from a single year’s results, saying the loss of younger and well-to-do renters would only “raise an alert” if it spills over into future years.But the shift “doesn’t surprise” Charlton Hamer, senior vice president of affordable housing developer The Habitat Companies.“Going back to the late aughts, we’ve seen this increase in the younger, educated population graduating from Big Ten schools and then gravitating toward Chicago,” Hamer said. “But as that group gets older, a lot of them are either buying infill single-family homes [in the city] or moving to inner-ring suburbs.”Another factor could be that younger well-to-do renters are simply doubling up and sharing higher-end apartments, reducing the number of rental households even while the number of actual renters continues to rise, according to Aaron Galvin, CEO of Luxury Living, which handles leasing for a number of high-end properties.“We’re seeing more couples renting a lot of the one-bedrooms in these newer buildings, which tend to have smaller unit sizes,” Galvin said. “So these apartments are getting smaller, but still commanding a high price point.”And if the city is seeing a dip in demand among big-spending renters, no one told the landlords who keep hiking rents, Galvin added. Rents are approaching $4 per square foot, and one-bedrooms are event renting for $3,000 in some newer buildings, after four years in which a combined 20,000 high-end apartments were added near the city core, according to data compiled by Luxury Living.Nearly half of Luxury Living’s clients come from outside the city, mirroring a heavy influx of coastal residents being drawn Downtown by high-salary jobs.Other luxury apartment brokers are seeing demand grow, too. Downtown Apartment Company, the rental division of Downtown Realty Company, saw a 22 percent hike in closings during the first quarter this year compared to 2018, managing broker Ben Creamer said. That followed a 13 percent rise between 2017 and 2018.“We’re maybe seeing an uptick on the buyer side with some older millennials, but I think rental demand is as strong as it’s ever been,” Creamer said.He added the growing glut of high-end apartments, especially around the South Loop with new developments like Essex on the Park and NEMA Chicago, is pushing luxury management companies and offer generous concessions in some parts of the city.The incentives may be strong enough to keep a major slice of well-do-to residents out of the buying market.And luxury resi brokers like Janice Corley, owner of RE/MAX Premier, have noticed. The suddenly wide availability of high-rise rentals is luring away many older spenders who would otherwise be looking for houses, Corley said.“It seems like baby boomers all decided to sell their [suburban] homes at the same time” and flock to ritzy Downtown apartments, Corley said. “And now that millennials are getting married and having kids, they’re not replacing the boomers. They’re staying in the city.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",111 West Maple Street

That will let the Chicago-based developer raze the existing taxi stand and build a drive-thru restaurant in its place. It would be the chain’s third location in the city. The bulk of the 90,000-square-foot site will be dedicated to a 128-vehicle parking lot. The plan was first presented during a public meeting in November.The entire project is set to cost around $15 million, according to GW principal Mitch Goltz. The restaurant will be built with a “prohibition-style” brick facade, evoking early 20th-century Chicago architecture, Goltz said. GW Properties has yet to purchase the land, and it still needs the Zoning Board of Appeals to approve a special-use permit for a drive-thru. Goltz said he hopes to complete the building in time for the restaurant to open by the end 2019.The site is in the alderman’s ward, meaning the project requires his consent to move forward. Ramirez-Rosa made the announcement in his constituent newsletter on Wednesday.Portillo’s, known across the region for its decadent Italian beef sandwiches and chocolate cake shakes, operates dozens of locations across Illinois but just two in Chicago, including one in River North. The other sits across the street from a 77,000-square-foot lot in the South Loop where GW Properties has proposed building a drive-thru Chick-Fil-A.Last year, Stan Sobieski was approved to build a 48-unit apartment complex at 2823 West Belmont Avenue. Elsewhere in Avondale, the Hubbard Street Group and Knickpoint Ventures are converting the 1.5-million-square-foot former Marshall Fields warehouse at 4000 West Diversey Avenue into a mixed-use hub with 123 apartments.Last month, GW and Angelo Gordon secured a $42 million loan to buy and redevelop two Macy’s department stores in Schaumburg and Oak Brook.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",3357 West Addison Street

Both plans show a mix of one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments measuring between 527 square feet and 995 square feet each.The building would replace a parking lot, playlot and low-lying retail strip at 3118 North Ashland Avenue, between Burley Elementary School and the busy six-way intersection of Ashland, Belmont and Lincoln avenues.Blue Star would likely lease a portion of its retail space to Xfinity, which occupies a building next door, according to Curbed.A staffer for Waguespack said he and community groups are still reviewing the proposal, which would need a zoning change to move forward.Chicago-based Blue Star lists 10 properties in its portfolio, including five in the West Loop. In July, the company put the 19-story National Building on the market for $200 million.Two blocks east of Blue Star’s Lakeview site, Newport Realty began building a 24-unit apartment complex last month.And four blocks to the North, Artis Senior Living is set to open its 136-unit facility at 3535 North Ashland Avenue early next year.\xa0[Curbed] — Alex NitkinAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",3118 North Ashland AvenueBlue St

Ickes Homes took is finally set to become reality.The City Council last week approved nearly $22 million in public financing for the 11-acre mixed-income “Southbridge” campus planned by McCaffery Interests and nonprofit The Community Builders near 23rd and State streets on the Near South Side. The developers say the benefits will allow them to break ground by the end of the summer.The plan, which secured planning and zoning approval last year, would eventually build 877 rental and for-sale homes and 60,000 square feet of retail space on the former site of the Ickes public housing complex, which the city razed in 2010 as part of former Mayor Richard M. Daley’s citywide “Plan for Transformation.”During the first regular council meeting held since Mayor Lori Lightfoot and a dozen new alderman took power, aldermen voted Wednesday to allocate $17 million in tax increment financing from the 24th/Michigan TIF district and a $4.8 million “multifamily loan” to the Southbridge development, according to Lightfoot’s office.Will Woodley, director of Chicago development for The Community Builders, called the vote a “big milestone” for the $97 million first phase of the development, which will include 206 apartments and 16,000 square feet of retail space spread across two buildings. The developer will set aside 68 units for CHA residents, with 112 market-rate apartments and another 26 units rented at affordable rates.“This allows us to move full speed ahead and close (on the property) so we can start construction in the next few months,” Woodley said.The financing will also pay for a project to fully connect Dearborn Street and 24th Street with the surrounding grid, he added. The final redevelopment is projected to include sports fields, a running track and pedestrian plazas.“We’re going to be moving aggressively over the next several years on future phases” of the complex, Woodley said. “But our main goal right now is to get that first phase started so we can establish Southbridge as a mixed-use destination that brings together the South Loop, Chinatown and Bronzeville.”The first phase is projected to be completed by early summer 2021, he added.Public financing galoreThe city-approved money would join a mishmash of other funding sources including a private mortgage, a $22 million loan from the Chicago Housing Authority and $40 million from the Illinois Housing Development Authority, according to Lightfoot’s office.Woodley did not say who is providing the private mortgage, or how much it was worth. He added that Goldman Sachs is an equity investor in the development, but declined to say the size of the investment bank’s stake.The development will absorb most of the roughly $18.1 million in total revenue the 24th/Michigan TIF had on hand as of last year. The district has collected property taxes to fund some $45 million in capital projects since it was commissioned in 1999, city and county records show. It is scheduled to expire in 2022.The Southbridge site is inside one of the city’s highest-profile Opportunity Zones, which offer tax breaks for equity investors who raise the taxable value of low-income census tracts. But the developers will not pursue Opportunity Fund investments for the site, Woodley said.Representatives of McCaffery did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

He recently revealed an updated design of an apartment tower of more than 500 units at Fulton Market’s 375 North Morgan Street that will rise on the western portion of on the site of the Guinness brewery and taproom that’s being built.Pamela Rueve and Michael Mandera of Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty were the listing agents for the house. The buyer has not been identified yet. Latkso said the house took a long time to sell. He first listed it in 2018 for $2.9 million and later slashed its price to $2.25 million before another reduction to $2 million in September last year.While Chicago’s pace of luxury home trades has been rapid this year, sellers have frequently had to cut their initial asking prices to make deals.Latsko bought the Astor Street home built in 1887 through a land trust, and he and his family didn’t live in the home.When Latsko bought the Astor Street mansion, he said he planned to use it if and when his family wanted to downsize from their current home, the landmarked 9,768-square-foot Francis J. Dewes mansion in Lincoln Park. He had listed that Gothic-revival style house for sale in 2011 for $9.9 million, though it never sold. He bought it for $1.3 million. Latsko still owns another Gold Coast property that his family can use if they ultimately decide to move.The three-story Astor Street house sits on a 71-foot-wide lot at the corner of North Astor and East Scott streets, a block south of the Goudy Square Playground Park, and served as the main residence of Chicago’s French consul in the 1960s.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1236 N Astor St

The three-bedroom, 4,250-square-foot unit hit the market on Feb. 4 and went under contract two days later, according to Zillow.If the deal had closed, it would have marked the second-priciest residential sale in the city and the most expensive condo sale in Lincoln Park this year. The largest residential sale was the six-bedroom, 8,400-square-foot mansion at 1837 North Orchard Street, which sold for $8.7 million on Feb. 4. The priciest condo sale this year was in the same Lincoln Park tower, a 35th-floor unit in February; the buyer paid $5.8 million for the 4,700-square-foot, four-bedroom home.The seller of a penthouse unit at Lincoln Park is James Gearen, head of investment firm Gearen Holdings in Minneapolis and Chicago, and former executive of Chicago commercial real estate firm Zeller Realty. Gearen bought the space in December 2015 for $2.35 million and commissioned architect Kevin Toukoumidis of Dspace Studio to finish it. Garen’s condo features 12-foot ceilings, oversized white oak flooring, and two balconies that offer expansive views of the park, the lake, and the skyline.The unit, one of two penthouses in the building, was originally offered as a single 12,500-square-foot condo at about $13 million. When the space remained unsold after a few years, the developers split it into two units and Gearan bought it three years after the building was complete in 2012.At least seven single-family houses and condo units sold in the city for $4 million or more this year as of Feb. 23, setting the stage for another strong luxury residential market.

The Cook County Circuit Court is expected to appoint real estate services firm Transwestern as the receiver next week.Chicago offices have suffered as people stayed home in the past year. The business district’s vacancy rate climbed to 17.9 percent in the third quarter, according to JLL, which expects the rate to rise as more sublease space becomes vacant.The 44-story Civic Opera House was struggling to fill the building even before the pandemic. Law firm Cassiday Schade exited its 60,000 square feet of offices in 2018.The pandemic also took a hit on two of its largest tenants, co-working providers Bond Collective and TeamWorking at TechNexus, which took up about 14 percent of the building. Smaller tenants also failed to pay rent, according to a statement by the owners.A February appraisal of the building valued it at $165 million, a 25 percent cut from $220 million in 2015, when the owners of the building refinanced with the current $164 million loan, according to data collected by Bloomberg and cited by Crain’s.601W and Berkeley are still renegotiating terms of the building’s mortgage with Rialto Capital, a special servicer that monitors the loan on behalf of investors in commercial mortgage-backed securities, Crain’s said.601W owns an office tower at 1 South Wacker Drive and is redeveloping a Northern Trust property at 801 South Canal Street into a multi-tenant office building.

The HNA Group affiliate, which is also the owner of a 44-story Park Avenue skyscraper in New York, filed for bankruptcy last year.HNA blamed SL Green, the property manager at 245 Park Avenue and New York’s largest office landlord, for the bankruptcy filing, saying the firm failed to secure a new anchor tenant at the property to replace Major League Baseball, whose lease expired on Oct. 31, 2021.Attorneys for SL Green objected to HNA’s reorganization plan, arguing the proposed transfer of the Chicago property was part of a fraudulent conveyance scheme to thwart SL Green, which has been trying to collect on a $185 million judgment it won against HNA Group in July.An attorney listed as the HNA affiliate’s representation in court records didn’t return a request for comment. HNA Group did not return a request for comment.The judgment stemmed from an arbitrator’s finding that HNA breached a contract related to SL Green’s investment in 245 Park Avenue. SL Green acquired the property last month.In the latest ruling, Judge Mary Walrath said she doubted whether HNA had proposed the transfer of the Chicago building in good faith and “could not in good conscience” approve it, adding that allowing the transfer would harm the SL Green affiliate seeking to collect on the previous judgment.Matthew Stein, who argued the objection on behalf of SL Green, called HNA’s proposed reorganization “a blatant last-minute attempt by HNA to transfer assets without consideration to hinder SL Green’s collection efforts.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",181 West Madison Street (181 West Madison Street

It’s listed at $25 million, almost six years after the Marienthals weren’t able to complete a sale after listing it for $30 million. Jones Lang LaSalle is handling the marketing.The buyer will have the option of demolishing the property and replacing it with a new development. Zoning would allow more than 85,000 square feet that could become retail space, a hotel or a residential building with apartments or condos.Carmine’s opened the location in 1994 and has almost three years left on its lease. JLL says al buyer would have some short-term income from the restaurant that could help bolster the redevelopment budget.Back in 2012, the Marienthal family had a deal in the works to sell the property for $18 million to a group of investors that included the owner of Carmine’s. The sale fizzled after a lawsuit was filed against the owner, which was later dismissed,The Marienthals included brothers Oscar and George, who ran Mister Kelly’s nightclub in the 1950s and 1960s in a building across the street from the property.

05:13 PM","A convicted Chicago real estate scammer’s former lawyer wants to hold onto condos he received from the client as payment in 2007, and is suing the banks trying to foreclose on them, claiming they are doing so fraudulently.","[""420 West Grand Avenue and 951 East Hyde Park Boulevard (River North Condos, Apartments)A convicted Chicago real estate scammer’s former lawyer wants to hold onto condos he received from the client as payment in 2007, and is suing the banks trying to foreclose on them, claiming they are doing so fraudulently.Rufus Cook, the former lawyer, and Robert Anthony Bryant, previously a client of Cook’s who served prison time in a scheme involving tax-delinquent real estate, filed a lawsuit late last month in Illinois federal court naming HSBC Bank, Bank of America, Citi, a Cook County judge and a slew of lawyers for the banks as defendants.Cook claims the defendants have no right to foreclose on his properties because they failed to keep adequate mortgage records. He says he’s getting robbed of due process in foreclosure proceedings that are still pending after 10 years of legal back-and-forth, and wants $2 million to cover damages he’s suffered, including attorneys’ fees, and to “punish defendants and deter such future violations,” according to court documents.“What this case is about is, among other things, the fraud the banks independently began committing in 2011 and 2012 when each fraudulently claimed to own a property it didn’t own,” Cook said in an email.Each of the defendant banks either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.Cook’s interest in the Chicago properties at the center of the federal lawsuit — condos at 951 East Hyde Park Boulevard and 420 West Grand Avenue, which also includes ground-floor commercial space — stems in part from his representation of Bryant. The former client was imprisoned from 2011 to 2015 after a federal judge found he defrauded more than 40 victims in a $1.4 million plot selling worthless documents pertaining to tax-delinquent real estate auctioned by Cook County, according to the Chicago Tribune. Bryant’s investors were unable to take titles with the papers and he rarely issued them refunds, prosecutors said at the time.Cook was told by federal officials he was being investigated as part of the scheme, too. Although there is no record of him being charged, Cook was disciplined in 2013 for representing both buyers and the seller in a transaction in which he had a personal interest, according to the Illinois State Bar Association.Bank of America is attempting to foreclose on one of the properties — which is listed for sale for $1.95 million by broker John Munson, who said he represents a trustee on a loan tied to the property and received offers but none at the price needed over the more than yearlong period it’s been marketed.“There is interest in this property, just not at the number they need,” Munson said.An auction was held for the property Feb. 25 and it fetched a $1.8 million bid, according to records of the Judicial Sales Corporation, which conducts most foreclosures sales in Cook County. Cook’s suit seeks to prevent a closing.Bank of America has indicated it holds claim to the property after a mortgage originally made to Bryant was transferred to the bank by another lender. Cook claims that Citi never had ownership of the mortgage and couldn’t have transferred it to Bank of America.Cook’s other property, a Hyde Park condo and commercial space, is being foreclosed on by HSBC, which he says is unable to prove it acquired the mortgage from the original lender on the property.In 2011, four years after the original lender’s bankruptcy, HSBC claimed to own the property records and sued Cook. The property is set for a sale March 30, according to the lawsuit, which claims that HSBC “still after over 14 years, [has] never having produced the negotiated note or a valid mortgage.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",420 West Grand Avenue

It was respectively bought and sold by limited liability companies Mohawk Partners II and Mohawk Partners.The home has long been the residence of Anne Dias, the philanthropist, investor and ex-wife of Griffin. Yet its owners are not clear from public records since the property changed hands in July, and the home was previously purchased by an LLC for $8.35 million in February 2016. The couple divorced in 2015.The July deal was an apparent off-market transaction, and the brokers weren’t disclosed, so the fact it’s for sale again so quickly shows it could have remained in the family with the last deal.Emily Sachs Wong with @properties Christie’s International Real Estate and Susan Miner of Premier Relocation are representing the seller. Miner is also representing the listing for Ken Griffin’s Park Tower penthouse.Sachs Wong said she and Miner were not involved in the previous transaction in July, and so are unable to comment on the timing of the listing.“The seller is offering this fantastic home for sale in a market at a great price with very little similar inventory,” she said.It’s unclear why the home is seeking $500,000 less than its July sale price. Before this home’s July sale, the last deal for a Lincoln Park home for more than $10 million came in December, when an 8,000-square-foot home on North Burling Street fetched $12.5 million.Dias is the CEO of New York City-based Aragon Global Management, which she founded in 2001.Griffin, the CEO of hedge fund Citadel, announced in June that he was relocating the firm to Miami in light of Chicago’s issues with crime. In July, he listed his two full-floor penthouse condominiums in Park Tower on Michigan Avenue. The 66th- and 67th-floor units are asking $13.25 million and $15.75 million, respectively.Griffin listed four high-priced condos earlier this year as well, and one of those has found a buyer. The five-bedroom 7,400-square-foot condo unit on the 37th floor of the Waldorf Astoria was listed for $11.5 million. It’s unknown whether the deal will close at that price, which would mark a loss from the $13.3 million Griffin bought it for in 2014.Contact Miranda Davis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n Lincoln Park home fetches $10M, sets 2022 area record \n Kellogg CEO sells Lincoln Park home for $6.2M \n Chicago Bulls’ Vucevic drops $5M on Lincoln Park homeAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2026 N Mohawk St

To fund it, it must raise $1.4 billion to qualify for a $2.2 billion federal grant.The proposed TIF district, which needs City Council approval, would freeze tax collections at a certain level within its boundaries. As much as $950 million of higher property taxes – the increment – would help finance the line’s extension.Chicago property taxes are tied to inflation, potentially providing a lift for the city’s revenue. As inflation accelerates, Mayor Lori Lightfoot could potentially quadruple taxes to $86 million next year if she decides to collect the full amount owed under her formula.The TIF proposal for the line’s extension is similar to a TIF district created to fund a rehab of the Red Line on the North Side. The authority is hoping to use funds through a federal grant program called New Starts, which helps fund rail extensions and new line projects across the nation.The South Side transit TIF district would span about eight blocks, starting at Madison Street in the Loop and running south to Pershing Road. The result would bring property tax funds into the Far South Side from areas in and around Downtown.The extension is “an equitable investment that supports a stronger Chicago for all,” Catherine Hosinski, a CTA spokeswoman, told the outlet. “Investing in all communities brings economic resilience and stability to the entire city. It also creates sustainable transportation options, which support critical climate and sustainability goals.”The TIF boundaries were drawn only to draw money for the CTA’s portion of the funding, and would exclude existing TIF districts, Hosinski told the publication. Legislation approved by Illinois six years ago said transit TIFs could be formed for the Red Line extension and three other projects.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

If it moves to the planned manufacturing district, it will join another incubator focused on manufacturing as Industrial Council of Nearwest Chicago occupies more than 400,000 square feet four blocks west of mHub’s potential new home.Seller Phil Denny of Peppercorn Capital purchased the property in 2013 for $13 million. It was recently appraised at $18 million. The building has been vacant since Crate & Barrel left in 2019.mHub and Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s request for TIF funding could garner criticism as that money is typically set aside for projects that can breathe new life into blighted areas throughout the city.

The 792,000-square-foot tower recently lost a major tenant, Ferrara Candy Company, to the massive Old Post Office at 433 West Van Buren Street.Bosch’s move shows companies are still betting on Oakbrook Terrace Tower and the Oak Brook area, despite others deciding to leave the suburbs for the city.

They also show the team has deposited $125,000 with the village for studies of the football stadium proposal, and that Bears Chairman George McCaskey and other leadership members have attended meetings about the purchase and stadium construction.The team said last fall that it agreed to buy the property from Churchill Downs for $197 million, pending approval from both parties.

He estimated the project would take up 10 to 15 acres on the 326-acre site and that the games could draw about 450,000 fans a year.According to the emails, Mayor Hayes said village officials would encourage the team to consider the idea, though team officials would make the final call.A spokesman for the Bears didn’t comment on the proposal and said the team is still trying to see if the site will work for a football stadium.[Chicago Tribune] – Rachel HerzogAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

It is the only one of five $3 million-plus listings on a two-block stretch of Ashland to find a buyer since the first home was listed, according to the report.The seller was Marcia Coleman and the buyers were not yet identified in public records. Robert Swindal of @properties had the listing.Four other houses between 909 and 1000 Ashland started out with asking prices over $3 million in the past couple years, and all had to cut their asking prices below that threshold, according to Crain’s. None has found a buyer.Swindal said the languishing listings reflect buyers who don’t want to spend big money maintaining large houses — and soaring property taxes. The home he sold at 914 Ashland had a tax bill of more than $51,000 last year, up more than 30 percent from a decade earlier.Sales of $1 million-plus homes in the Chicago area grew by 1.4 percent last year, a dramatic drop from the 10 percent growth in sales of $1 million-and-up homes recorded in 2017, according to Crain’s. Despite the slowdown in the overall luxury market, sales of homes trading at $4 million or more posted a record year in 2018.

The Chicago area ranks third in the country for data center capacity.The Northbrook-based firm earlier this month filed applications with the city for the project at the Fisk Generating Station at 1111 West Cermak Road, according to Block Club Chicago.Hilco wants to build a 103,000-square-foot building on the north side of the property and a 247,000-square-foot building on the south side. The firm is under contract to buy the site from NRG Energy.A surge in the construction of Chicago-area data centers ballooned the industry’s regional vacancy rate from 2 percent to 11 percent last year. Pushed by growing demand for cloud-computing storage, developers built almost 57 megawatts of capacity — enough to power more than 16,000 homes — around the metro area in the first eight months of 2018, according to CBRE data.In addition to the data center project at the Fisk plant site, Hilco is redeveloping the former Crawford Coal Plant in Little Village into a 1 million-square-foot logistics complex.Both the Crawford and Fisk plants closed in 2012 after years of opposition from community groups and environmental activists. But the EPA is considering letting the Fisk plant use its “peaker” diesel generators during periods of high demands, according to Block Club.

It was half the company’s total space there.Nearly a year later, with 5.4 million square feet of vacant office space having piled up across the city, Groupon has decided to sublease the remaining half of its offices at the Sterling Bay-owned building.The digital coupon company has put its remaining 144,000 square feet of office space on the market at 600 West Chicago Avenue, according to Crain’s. Scores of firms have done the same over the last year across the city, including most recently Uber, which said it would look to sublease 150,000 square feet at 601W Companies’ Old Post Office; and rail car provider TTX, which put up 100,000 square feet of space at its West Loop headquarters.Groupon has hired CBRE to market all of the approximately 300,000 square feet at its HQ, in which the company’s name is emblazoned on the building. Its lease lasts at least through January 2024, according to the report. The company, which also subleases some space to a tech firm led by Groupon co-founder Brad Keywell, said it intended to “maintain an office on whichever floor isn’t subleased,” a spokesperson said.That follows a similar move last month in New York by Yelp and PricewaterhouseCoopers.

The sale and buyers haven’t appeared in Cook County records yet, but the deal showed up on public listing networks this week.Details on the property are slim, though at the time Mack bought the unit, it was reported to be a three-bedroom across half of a floor in the ultra-luxury building developed by JDL, which completed the 68-unit building in 2019. Mack’s former condo was equipped with a 14-foot kitchen island, a primary suite with a sitting area and wet bar and a 750-foot covered terrace with hot tub.Mack was far from the only high-profile professional athlete to have lived in the building. No. 9 Walton has drawn purchases by Jason Heyward, who just finished up his seventh and final season as a Cubs outfielder, as well as Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews of Blackhawks fame. Heyward and Toews sold their units for $7.2 million and $7 million, respectively, but Kane still owns his $6.4 million condo in the building.Ken Griffin, the financial chief and founder of Citadel who is moving his family and company to Miami because of Chicago’s crime rate, owns the top four floors of the building at 9 West Walton Street. Griffin, who spent $58 million for the floors in 2017, never finished the units. Ahead of his move, Griffin listed one of the No. 9 Walton units — a 7,085-square-foot unfinished unit on the 35th floor — for $14 million. It’s not yet known what he plans to do with the remaining three floors.The $6.9 million sale is the 31st Chicago-area home to sell for $6 million or more so far in 2022. In all of 2021, there were 32 sales at this level.JDL is in the midst of building its 812-unit One Chicago apartment project at 1 West Chicago Avenue.

Doctors in the building would serve both residents and outside patients, Ponte told Crain’s.She estimated the project would cost $500 million to $600 million.While most senior-housing developers in the Chicago-area have located their projects in the suburbs or outlying city neighborhoods, the Ponte project would look to get in on the broader demand for Downtown rentals that has led to an ongoing apartment boom in the central business district.

Public records don’t clearly identify the sellers.According to the listing, the three-bedroom property is within a 1920s building, and has windows with views in all four directions.

The firm continued to promote Wanda’s involvement in its sales pitch for the 101-story project, according to the suit. That came even as Magellan “knew Dalian was actively seeking to exit the Vista Towers project and that Wanda would not be the hotelier of the finished project,” according to a lawsuit filed last week in Cook County circuit court.Magellan, which previously owned a 10-percent stake in the project before the recent $270 million buyout, had long insisted that Wanda was committed to the development, even as the Chinese conglomerate was publicly shopping its stake as part of efforts to sell off $4 billion in investments worldwide. That selloff included a condo-hotel project in Los Angeles and a 20-percent stake in the Atlético Madrid soccer team.The Chicago developer told Crain’s that Wanda was still “fully engaged” in 2017, and told The Real Deal “Wanda is our partner on the property” in 2018. Wanda Group is still listed as a partner on the Vista Tower’s website.The hotel portion of Vista Tower was once slated to be Wanda Group’s first U.S. hotel, with 210 rooms, a spa and a restaurant. The tower, which was expected to be ready for occupancy in the third quarter, will have roughly 400 condo units — including an $18.5 million unit that would be one of the priciest in Chicago history.Vogel’s attorney told Crain’s that the value of the unit “absolutely is less” without Wanda’s involvement in the project. “Wanda is worldwide and was going to provide a lot of cachet, because it would be like no other hotel and condo combo in the city,” he said.Vogel put down a roughly $1.5 million deposit for the unit in 2018, soon after selling his boat manufacturing company for $805 million. He spent another $1.74 million on design fees and other costs, which he is also seeking to have refunded.

The deals also highlight the continued strength of Chicago’s Fulton Market district, and are a sign that the city’s pulverized office market is slowly recovering.In the larger purchase, Google’s Midwest HQ is going to an undisclosed buyer for around $360 million, according to the report. That’s about what landlord American Realty Advisors sought for the 520,000-square-foot complex at 1000 W. Fulton Market when it listed the property in late April.The price is also about 20 percent over what ARA paid Sterling Bay for the 10-story building in 2016. That’s a hefty return in a city office market whose first quarter vacancy rate climbed to a 15-year high.

That building would include a five-story parking garage.Village officials discussed the project at a meeting this week, with Mayor Tom Hayes saying he’d like to see a rooftop restaurant for the 12-story building to bring people downtown.Officials expressed mixed feelings to the project, but said they were encouraged by the Chicago-based developer’s early commitment to provide as many as 54 units at below-market rates.The project now faces reviews before coming before the village board for a vote.The board recently approved Springbank Real Estate Group’s plans to launch the next phase of the $320 million Arlington Downs development, which would include a 116-key hotel, a 263-unit apartment building and a First Ascent Climbing Gym. Future plans include four retail complexes totaling 40,000 square feet and two more residential buildings.Apartment rents in Chicago’s suburbs hit record highs this year but could plateau. The second-quarter median net rent for Chicago-area suburbs ticked up by 1.2 percent year over year, ending at $1.47 per square foot, according to Integra Realty Resources.

In addition to work by two other designers, the airport is expected to be expanded by 60 percent, if all goes to plan.Hotels in that O’Hare market have been hammered, with an increasing number shutting down in the months since the virus took hold.

A Burlington Coat Factory store taking up about 65,000 square feet is set to vacate and be replaced by clothing retailer Forman Mills, according to CBRE brokers assigned to leasing and selling the property.The Marshfield property doesn’t include the Jewel Osco grocery store and Blue Cross Blue Shield Community Center at its south end, which are owned separately and sold last year for $20 million to New York’s Beitel Group. Yet grocery stores and the consumer traffic they attract has appealed to retailers who want to locate nearby, boosting property values and investor demand.“Most of these shopping centers have performed well through the pandemic,” said CBRE’s Christian Williams, who represented PGIM, an arm of Prudential Financial, in the sale. “It has brought retail back into the forefront as an asset class. People to some degree have refocused on retail and said, ‘Hey it survived the evolution of e-commerce over the past decade and the pandemic.’”Grocery-anchored centers accounted for more than a third of retail transaction volumes in the first quarter across the nation this year, a spillover of last year’s record pace of deals for the asset class, according to JLL. Last year’s record totaled 735 trades of grocery-anchored assets, 13 more than a previous high set in 2014. Companies spent more than $13.3 billion on the properties, the largest share of any retail property type for a third year and the second-most in recorded history.As shopping center prices rise, profit margins have narrowed along with cap rates, a measure of the rental income a property generates compared with its purchase price, which dropped half a percentage point from from 2019 levels, JLL said this year.It’s the second grocery-anchored retail property that Williams’ team has closed in the range of $30 million in the last several weeks.

But so far, Acevedo’s biggest backers have been construction unions, election records show.On March 15, the International Union of Operating Engineers, already a generous backer of Acevedo’s campaign, dropped another $15,000 into his fund. In all, Acevedo has taken in $24,000 in contributions of $1,000 or more from builder groups since he and Sigcho-Lopez advanced to a runoff for the seat on Feb. 26.Those contributions account for some two-thirds of his total pool of large donations during the five-week lead-up to the runoff, according to an analysis of campaign finance records by The Real Deal.Connections to the industry have become a cudgel in the race to replace retiring Alderman Danny Solis, who stepped down from his powerful perch as chairman of the City Council Zoning Committee earlier this year after revelations surfaced he was under federal investigation for trading support for developers for political favors.The ward includes chunks of fast-developing neighborhoods like the South Loop, West Loop and Chinatown, as well as the entire 62-acre future site of Related Midwest’s The 78 megadevelopment. It also includes most of Pilsen, a mostly Mexican-American neighborhood where Sigcho-Lopez long has demanded Solis do more to stem the tide of gentrification.The Sigcho-Lopez campaign has been propped up by five-figure donations from public sector unions like the Chicago Teachers Union and Service Employees International Union, plus a nearly $80,000 contribution from his wife, Loreen Targos.But Acevedo, son of former state Rep. Edward Acevedo, has drawn support from a broad base of private-sector donors, including $69,500 in contributions of $1,000 or more from donors with ties to the real estate industry. The sum amounts to about 43 percent of his fundraising total.(Click to enlarge)Last week, a political committee representing the Chicago Association of Realtors confirmed it would send a check to Acevedo’s campaign, while the Illinois Association of Realtors is funding mailers and digital ads to support him.“Alex has run a very strong campaign in very diverse and divisive ward,” said Brian Bernardoni, policy director and lobbyist for the Chicago Association of Realtors. “We think he will be a good partner and will hold us accountable to needs of his community, yet still show openness and willingness to work with us.”Acevedo has also received $10,000 from the Laborers International Union of North America, $5,000 from contractor John James Construction and $3,500 from the Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters.A spokesperson for the Acevedo campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday, but the candidate wrote in a statement last month he was “proud to be endorsed by the unions, like LiUNA, Operating Engineers, Carpenters, Plumbers, which continue to offer our communities careers and living wages upon which our residents can raise a family.”Most developers have steered clear of the race, but some have thrown in their lot with Acevedo — most notably JDL Development, which sent a $5,000 donation on Feb. 22. That followed a $5,000 personal donation from JDL CEO Jim Letchinger and his wife, Stephanie, on Feb. 8.JDL, known as the firm behind glitzy new residential towers No. 9 Walton, Eight Eleven Uptown and the upcoming One Chicago Square in River North, does not list any 25th Ward properties in its portfolio.Letchinger did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.Acevedo also registered a $4,500 donation from Shore Property Management and a $1,000 contribution from prolific Northwest Side home builder Noah Properties, both on Feb. 20.The candidate had pledged during a debate in January that he would not accept campaign donations from developers, according to WBEZ.In a statement Thursday, Sigcho-Lopez spokesperson Rebecca Evans seized on the contributions from JDL and others in an attempt to tie Acevedo to the disgraced alderman he’s vying to replace.“The developer money and PAC money flooding our opponent’s campaign tells us one thing: Alex Acevedo is picking up where Danny Solis left off,” Evans said.Acevedo and Sigcho-Lopez have spent the months-long campaign vowing to democratize the zoning approval process for new development.In his statement last month, Acevedo wrote that he is pushing for a new, transparent and participatory zoning and development process.Sigcho-Lopez said he would require any new development seeking a zoning change to set aside 30 percent of units as affordable, well above the 20 percent mandated under the newest affordability pilot zone introduced for Pilsen and Little Village last year.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Tsoumpas spent $25.2 million on the property in 2018, making the recent deal a 40 percent increase in value for the 74,800-square-foot store.Grocery stores nationwide have experienced boosts to their value as they’ve traded at higher velocity than usual in the past two years. In suburban Glenview, Arizona’s Nottinghill Gate Tucson paid Chicago’s Inland Real Estate $17.7 million for the 64,000-square-foot Jewel-Osco grocery store at 1340 Patriot Boulevard. The purchase marked a 42 percent increase in value over the $12.5 million it sold for in 2017. In addition, public records show that San Diego-based REIT Realty Income, paid New York’s Melohn Properties $52.4 million for a 65,500-square-foot Mariano’s store at 1625 South Clark Street in the Near South Side. The sellers bought the property in 2014 for $40.5 million.The Kroger chain-owned Mariano’s has a lease in the Crystal Lake property that will expire in 17 years. The store generates $1.48 million in net operating income.The buyer was insulated from rising interest rates. An existing mortgage against the property was inherited through the deal, meaning the buyer didn’t have to take out a new loan at a higher rate. The assumable mortgage increased the price, as the loan has a rate of 4.45 percent, whereas a new one would likely come with an interest above 6 percent, said Jason Meier of brokerage Stan Johnson, which arranged the deal.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",105 Northwest Highway (St

Susan Miner, founder of Premier Relocation, Inc., is representing the sellers and didn’t respond to a request for comment.Interiors (Redfin)The listing joins the top end of the ultra luxury market in Chicago, with few other homes at that price point. The 7,500-square-foot full-floor penthouse unit on the 65th floor at One Bennett Park in Streeterville is now the highest-priced condo on the market, asking just over $15 million.Built in 2009, the Waldorf Astoria building includes condos on the upper floors and a hotel on the lower portion. Condo owners in the 60-story get access to the hotel’s amenities through a fee in their association assessments. Those include 24-hour security, room service, access to the spa, indoor pool, fitness center and Pilates studio.Interiors (Redfin)Condo sales have had a challenging year in Chicago. Despite several notable sales, such as the record-setting $20 million deal at Trump Tower in March, the condo market lags behind Chicago’s single-family market on several data points. Condos spend more time on the market, on average, than detached single-family homes. In the first three months of the year, Chicago houses sold after an average of 61 days on the market while condos sold in an average of 99 days.At a time when home prices are rising fast, in Chicago’s suburbs and in most city neighborhoods, the downtown condo market is a weak spot.In the first two months of the year, the median price of attached homes (condos and townhouses) sold in the city dipped 1.4 percent from a year earlier, according to CAR data, while for single-family homes, the median price rose 5.4 percent.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",11 E Walton Street

Derek Kaptanoglu of Essex Realty Group represented the seller and buyer.“The property has been meticulously maintained by the same owner for the last 25 years,” Kaptanoglu told the Business Journal. “The suburban multifamily markets should remain extremely competitive for the remainder of 2022 as we continue to experience a major lack of inventory and large investor demand for well-located suburban properties.”The building, which is 100 percent occupied, has eight one-bedrooms and two two-bedrooms. It also has on-site laundry facilities and 10 parking spaces.Further north, Chicago investment firm Morningside USA sold the Stewart School Lofts apartments for $23 million.

That moves forward a planned $250 million project to develop a 261,000-square-foot facility with labs, classrooms and offices set to become a centerpiece in an “innovation district.”Construction is set to begin next year, in the southwest corner of the 62-acre development site between Chinatown and the South Loop that Related is aiming to turn into Chicago’s 78th neighborhood. The developer plans to build 13 million square feet of offices, shops, hotels and fitness centers, including the university project, dubbed the Discovery Partners Institute, as well as thousands of homes, with 20 percent of them set to be designated affordable units.Related says $7 billion will be invested into the overall project, including improvements to public transit.“As a hive of activity featuring state-of-the-art lab, classroom and meeting spaces, DPI will develop applied R&D clusters, funded by corporations, government and foundations, that aim to solve complex societal challenges,” Related’s website for The 78 says of the university facility.The academic aspect of The 78 was initiated by former Gov. Bruce Rauner, and has been slow to take shape, changing locations within the development site as Related partnered with Rush Street Gaming, operator of Rivers casinos, to bid for Chicago’s first casino license created by a 2020 law, Crain’s reported.Rivers 78 is now one of three casino proposals remaining on Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s desk after she cut two of the five from consideration on Tuesday, and it would be on the north end of the development plan, separated by a park from the research institution near 15th and Wells Streets.The research institute project also will be given the right to claim about three acres next door for later phases of development, with $250 million secured for the first building so far.Related itself also is considering erecting additional buildings that could be leased to DPI or others attracted by the research facility, Crain’s reported, citing unnamed sources.“The Discovery Partners Institute will anchor the Innovation District at The 78, and we’re proud that it will attract and retain Illinois’ brightest talent with education and innovation that will elevate Chicago’s position on the global stage,” Curt Bailey, president of Related Midwest, said, according to Crain’s. “With DPI’s collaboration, The 78 will be a powerful engine for jobs, startups and new technologies as well as a residential and entertainment destination.”The university project is set to be completed in late 2025 or early 2026.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

But by Friday, with activists outside her Logan Square home shouting, “Mayor Lightfoot lies, Little Village dies,” she put the kibosh on the plan.The Department of Buildings had previously said that the “turbine structure” on the site is “unsound and needs to be removed immediately.”“I’m very worried about people who have been breaking into the site continuing to scale the fence in search of copper and other scrap. That’s just a recipe for disaster,” Lightfoot said weeks ago.It’s unclear when exactly the remainder of the site will be demolished.Lightfoot has laid the blame at Hilco’s door, saying the Northbrook-based industrial developer was ultimately responsible for its Florida-based demolition subcontractor having not abided by legal and health standards on April 11. Hilco was fined $68,000. And in May, the state attorney general sued Hilco, MCM Management Corp. and Controlled Demolition Inc. for violating environmental laws.Hilco’s plan is to demolish the shuttered power plant and finish remediation of the 70-acre site. Afterward, it would construct what it claims would be the largest available warehouse space in Chicago, at about 1 million square feet.Hilco has branded the Chicago project “Exchange 55,” and said it will cost about $100 million.Hilco in 2017 spent $12 million to buy the plant, which was shut down in 2012 after years of pressure from environmentalists. The firm received a $20 million city subsidy on the project, and secured a $153 million construction loan from Pacific Coast Partners in July.Activists have called on Lightfoot to rescind the city subsidy.

Under the plan, the city would divert revenue generated by property tax growth inside the zone into a special fund for public infrastructure projects.Officials from the city’s Department of Planning and Development estimated the district would raise up to $800 million during its 23-year life cycle, helping pay for some $700 million in streetscape and public transportation upgrades. Some of the projects, like a pair of new bridges over the river and a “transitway” connecting Downtown with Lincoln Yards, were explicitly proposed by Sterling Bay when it unveiled its plan for the site earlier this year.The city would also dip into the district fund to build an eastern extension of the 606 Trail, and to rebuild the decaying Clybourn Metra station.City planner Tim Jeffries said the neighborhood would have to “adopt a different set of infrastructure standards” to transform the industrial tract into a hub of homes and offices, following a long-term strategy kicked off by last year’s sweeping North Branch Framework Plan to rezone of the area around the river.“This shift will create a waterfall of benefits that trickle down through the rest of the city,” Jeffries said.But the presenters withstood withering criticism from dozens of attendees at the meeting who said the plan would mean using their own tax dollars to bankroll Sterling Bay’s ambitions. Scores of neighbors wore green stickers saying “No Park No Deal,” urging city leaders to build a 24-acre public park along the east bank of the river before any new development is approved.Officials intend to introduce their plan for the new TIF district at next month’s meeting of the city’s Community Development Commission, all leading up to final passage through the City Council in April. But Alderman Brian Hopkins (2nd), who would have to approve the use of any TIF funds inside the district, said at the end of the meeting that he was “open to considering other options” to slow down the process.“This is the first time as alderman I’ve had to deal with the TIF issue, so this is actually new to me,” Hopkins told the crowd.In July, Hopkins slowed the approval process for Lincoln Yards to a crawl by blocking its discussion in the City Council, saying the proposal hadn’t been sufficiently vetted by neighbors.Chicago’s North Branch industrial corridor (Credit: Bernt Rostad via Flickr)The city established its first TIF district in 1984, in an attempt to attract developers to the snakebitten Block 37 property in the Loop. Today, 144 such districts are active across the city, some spanning entire neighborhoods. The city created its most recent new TIF district earlier this year in the Northwest Side neighborhood of Mayfair, where Jaffe companies is getting $13 million in taxpayer benefits to help finance its Edens Collection retail center.Most of the proposed Cortland/Chicago River TIF district would be carved out of an existing TIF district, called the North Branch/South TIF, which the city established in 1998. That district, which hugs the west bank of the river between Cortland and Chicago avenues, raised almost $11 million last year, according to Cook County Clerk David Orr’s TIF Viewer.Sterling Bay bought the 22-acre site of A. Finkl Steel & Sons on the east bank of the river in late 2016, and months later paid the city $105 million for the 13-acre former home of its fleet and facilities management department on the west bank. Earlier this year, General Iron Industries announced it would sell its 21.5-acre property to the south and east of the Lincoln Yards area.Sterling Bay has scheduled a meeting later this month to reveal new details of its Lincoln Yards plan.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Up to 30 units would be available to people with Chicago Housing Authority vouchers. All of the units would be wheelchair-accessible, and 15 would be reserved for military veterans.The original proposal, whose 100 units were targeted to tenants across the income spectrum, kicked up a swarm of resistance among residents of the middle-class neighborhood when it was unveiled in early 2017.Detractors during an introductory meeting said they believed the affordable homes would invite crime and drive down property values. The opposition gave rise to a neighborhood group called Northwest Side Unite, which later focused its ire on the development’s potential to exacerbate school overcrowding.Another new neighborhood group, called Neighbors for Affordable Housing in Jefferson Park, emerged to support the proposal. The split represented a growing divide between older Jefferson Park residents who have traditionally resisted development, and younger families who have supported it.The plan commission last year approved the construction of a five-story storage warehouse next to the Full Circle site. That project received its building permit, and construction is expected to get underway later this year.In February, Full Circle announced it had reduced the number of apartments in its proposal by 25 percent but the building would remain 76 feet tall. The new plan includes five studio apartments, 16 one-bedroom apartments, 16 two-bedrooms and 38 three-bedrooms, down from 51 three-bedrooms in the original proposal.The proposal still needs approval from the City Council’s zoning committee, as well as a final vote from the full council.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Vacant department stores have proved difficult for landlords to fill, often requiring investment from owners to divide them into smaller spaces for new types of tenants or demolishing shopping strips to convert the property into new uses including housing.Yet a joint venture of New York’s Fortress Investment Group and Michigan’s Lormax Stern landed Macy’s at the former Carson’s. The retailer plans two smaller-format stores at the property instead of one large outlet.The first floor will hold a Market by Macy’s, the first Chicago-area location of the company’s new concept, which usually range from 20,000 to 58,000 square feet and mostly sell clothes and often swap change out their merchandise. The second floor will host a Macy’s Backstage, an off-price chain started in 2015.Fortress and Lormax last year sold most of the shopping strip known as Evergreen Plaza — the first regional mall in the country when it opened in 1952 and the second indoor one after a 1960s renovation — for $67 million and retained control of the vacant Carson’s.Lormax in 2015 tore down the old mall and replaced it with the smaller retail center that now hosts Whole Foods Market, Burlington, T.J. Maxx, Planet Fitness and Ulta Beauty as its other tenants across 255,000 square feet.A team of brokers led by Joe Parrott of CBRE represented the landlord in the lease, and another team headed by CBRE’s Luke Molloy represented Macy’s.[Crain’s] — Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

He now serves as chief marketing officer for bed-in-a-box company Molecule.Listing agent Rafael Murillo of Compass said Lyle and his wife combined two units in the building into the larger condo, which includes a 900-square-foot master suite.The unit was used as a backdrop during filming of the Dick Wolf series, and the inconvenience of the production came with benefits for Lyle, including getting to meet Kinney, Lady Gaga, Wolf and others from the show, Murillo said.“He thinks it was one of the coolest experiences,” Murillo said.Lady Gaga and Taylor Kinney (Credit: Getty Images)The open-concept living and dining rooms span nearly 50 feet, and the kitchen features high-end appliances and quartz countertops. The unit comes with an existing 1,200-square-foot outdoor space that can be expanded over the former second unit.The movie theater has a 120-inch screen, wet bar, candy bar and beverage center. One of the bathrooms has a $7,000 Kohler Numi toilet, Murillo said.“I don’t know how many firefighters can afford that, but that’s TV,” Murillo said with a laugh.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",411 South Sangamon Street

The developers said they needed the extension because supply chain issues delayed construction.Catalyst and Marquette plan to build a $50 million, 210-unit residential complex called The Union with 10,000 square feet of ground-floor retail or restaurant space at the corner of Villa and East Wildwood Avenues.“We went through a pretty rigorous process in terms of vetting a number of general contractors that we thought were appropriate for this project,” Catalyst’s David Lyon told the outlet. “Uniformly across them, it was expressed to us [that] because of disruptions in the supply chain, procurement, lead times for critical elements of the project would require a spring start.”Lyon also said building materials such as concrete, electrical meters and switches are hard to come by and the developers need more time to get the materials.While some have expressed concern that the developers now have another six months to back out, Lyon said they’ve already invested $275,000 to $300,000 and are committed to seeing it through.Lyon also said with the extension, the project’s timeline might align better with the village’s plan to create a new tax increment financing district along the full St. Charles Road corridor, just to the north.Lyon estimated that construction on the project could begin as early as March 2023.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",110 South Villa Avenue

At least one of them is.A week after city officials pulled the plug on all projects undertaken by the crew behind the controversial fixer-upper show, co-host Alison Victoria wrote in an Instagram post Monday that she’s working with a new general contractor to clear things up.The post calls into question whether contractor Donovan Eckhardt, Victoria’s co-host, has a future with the show.The city’s buildings department last week cited Eckhardt’s contracting firm, Greymark Development, with more than a half-dozen violations, including lying on applications and hiring unlicensed workers. Until Greymark shows that it’s addressed the issues, the firm is blackballed from applying for permits in the city.Victoria wrote in her post Monday she is “working closely with the City of Chicago to repair and amend any and all permits with our new general contractors.”“The building department says they are pleased with our efforts and we will continue to work closely together to move in the right direction,” the post continued. She did not mention Eckhardt or Greymark Development.The first season of “Windy City Rehab” showed Victoria and Eckhardt renovating and attempting to sell 11 properties on the city’s North Side. The show is currently filming its second season with a handful of new projects, including an effort to transform the former home of the beloved Miko’s Italian Ice in Bucktown.Earlier this year, a Sun-Times investigation found the show’s producers had racked up a litany of complaints from neighbors over trash, noise and code violations. In May, the crew was hit with a stop-work order for one of the homes it planned to flip in Bucktown.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

There is a 33.5 percent increase from this time last year with properties under contract, showing strong demand.“According to local Compass agents, multiple offers and offers with few to no contingencies are still common in many areas yet buyers are willing to exercise more patience than they were at this time last year,” Stribling-Kivlan said.The new report comes after a similar January report that showed Chicago’s hot housing market was likely to continue.Pent-up demand continues to outweigh new supply, driving competition and price growth that will continue to give sellers an advantage. After steep declines in the inventory of homes available in 2020 and 2021, 44 percent of the agents expect supply to improve. Of the total, 39 percent said it will stay the same while 18 percent responded that inventory will decrease.According to that report, local realtors expect demand for homes seen during the pandemic to spill over into 2022, preventing a substantial increase of homes from accumulating on the market. This led 66 percent of respondents to predict that 2022 will continue to favor sellers.vRead more\n\n Chicago’s housing market frenzy seen continuing in 2022 \n Chicago’s on-market housing inventory at record low \n Chicago’s hot housing market scaring off first-time buyersAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",5 percent during the same period.St

Michigan Ave. in Streeterville also includes a redevelopment of Tribune Tower, which is underway and stands next to the skyscraper site. That involves turning the 36-story former newspaper headquarters into a luxury condo development. Golub and CIM have planned 162 condo units, ranging from $700,000 to $7.6 million at the historic property.For the 113-story Tribune Tower East, plans call for 439 rental units, 125 condos and 200 hotel rooms. Below street level would be just under 11,000 square feet of retail space and 430 parking spaces accessible from lower-level streets.Zoning allows for 1.6 million square feet on the full site. CIM and Golub’s plans call for about 2 million square feet, and they plan to “buy” permission for the extra space by paying about $14 million into a commercial development fund.The project has been criticized by local residents for its scope and what they say will be the added congestion to the surrounding area. A revised version of the project addressed residents’ concerns, the developers said.\nThe tower would displace Trump Tower — 1,389 feet — as the city’s second tallest, and would rank behind only the Willis Tower, which rises 1,451 feet.

Little progress has been made on the 25,000-square-foot space between the purchase and this week, when Griffin announced his move, and it would cost about $25 million to make it livable.Walton developer Jim Letchinger and Coldwell Banker agent Chezi Rafaeli told the outlet that they’re concerned Griffin’s exit will hurt the luxury housing market in Chicago — specifically the building itself, which is also home to Chicago Cubs right fielder Jason Heyward, Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews and former Ferrara Candy CEO Todd Siwak.“Ken Griffin did contribute tremendously to the feeling of exclusivity,” Rafaeli told the outlet. “The magnitude of the price of his penthouse made them feel comfortable spending $11 million or $12 million on condos there.”Still, the fact that the space isn’t complete may work in its favor, because it may be easier to sell as individual floors rather than one large unit, Rafaeli said. Each floor could support its own kitchen and bathrooms, making it more feasible to split.The first and second floors would probably be marketed individually and the third and fourth floors would be offered as a duplex with the pool and rooftop, Letchinger said. Demand is high, Rafaeli said. One condo that wasn’t listed publicly sold for $17.4 million and Letchinger sold his own condo there for $9 million.Griffin, the state’s wealthiest resident, cited Chicago’s high crime rate among reasons for his departure.[CCB] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",12 million on condos there.”St

The building, which will be designed by Chicago-based architecture firm NORR, will also include 41,000 square feet of office space and 8,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.Mavrek is teaming up with retail developer GW Properties and apartment consulting firm Luxury Living Chicago Realty for the project.The site, which is currently home to a three-story parking garage, is just on the other side of Michigan Avenue from the Shops at North Bridge mall and down the street from a Whole Foods and the InterContinental Chicago hotel.Current zoning for the property allows for the project to move forward without special approval from the City Council.The proposed development will include multiple small apartments. Half of the 248 residences will be studio units ranging in size from 492 to 706 square feet and the remaining units will be one- and two-bedrooms. According to the proposal, most of the apartments will have balconies and the building will have a coworking lounge, fitness center and rooftop outdoor pool and deck.Luxury Living Founder and CEO Aaron Galvin said apartment demand has changed since the beginning of the pandemic. “We have seen a shift in renter demand asking for more one-bedroom and den spaces and paying premiums for units with private outdoor space,” Galvin said.Mavrek has developed multiple low-rise multifamily projects in Chicago, but this new project will represent Mavrek’s first highrise development in the central business district.[CCB] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",535 North St. Clair Street

Only four public listings are priced higher, including Michael Jordan’s $14.8 million Highland Park mansion and the $15.1 million penthouse at One Bennett Park. Should the home sell at $14 million, it would appear to be a record for Kenilworth.Inside of 501 Sheridan Road in Kenilworth, IL (Zillow)The home includes two lots on Lake Michigan shoreline, one of which currently houses a sculpture garden. The home is being sold by a trust established by the late owners of the house, who were not identified by public records. Though it has Lake Michigan Shoreline, it lacks a beach. The property has a multi-tiered walkway with a lower deck above boulders that line the water’s edge.Nancy Nugent, the Sotheby’s agent representing the estate selling the home, said the property was built in the 1960s and hasn’t been on the market since the 1970s. The home was shopped on the private market last October, but did not find a buyer at the time.Inside of 501 Sheridan Road in Kenilworth, IL (Zillow)Nugent said the five-bedroom, six-bathroom house is significant because it’s rare to find double lots on the lake in Kenilworth — a highly sought after suburb given its relative smaller size and appealing school district.Inside of 501 Sheridan Road in Kenilworth, IL (Zillow)“There’s some features of the town that have a very big draw for families coming to the north shore, both from the city and from other locations,” Nugent said.The home also offers buyers a blank slate to add any amenities they want, such as a sports court, golf simulator or pool.“Everyone wants their own private oasis,” she said. “Post-covid people like to have their own space, and that gives you the opportunity to do that.”Kenilworth has few other properties that compare, with no other listings over $5.5 million.

Amalgamated Financial has an obligation to address those issues, which we believe are not financial in nature, and move forward with refiling their application with the FDIC. Our goal is to help them overcome the issues that have been raised and we are confident that the sale can get back on track.”The New York bank says it specializes its commercial real estate business on $3 million to 25 million deals in the New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and Bay Area metropolitan areas.Amalgamated of Chicago, which Crain’s reported has little union ownership now, had $1.6 billion in assets at the end of 2021, up from $950 million it had when it agreed to sell to the New York bank.The Chicago bank’s net income was $4.5 million in 2021, an increase from $3.5 million in 2020, while its 5 percent return on equity in 2021 lower than peer financial institutions, Crain’s reported.[Crain’s] – Sam Lounsberry \u200b\u200bAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",30 North LaSalle Street

The 11-acre property, with a 26,000-square-foot building and 325 parking spaces, has been valued at about $12.5 million and the suggested opening bid is $2.5 million.“It’s been a very popular venue,” Rick Levin, principal of Rick Levin & Associates, the Chicago-based company holding the auction, told the outlet. “It could be so many things,” he said, noting that replicating it would cost more than $10 million.Since the auction involves the real estate and not the business, the site could be used for something other than a banquet hall. A buyer could repurpose it as medical offices, retail space, senior housing or a hotel, Levin’s firm said. Alsip Mayor John Ryan said he hopes the property will continue to be run as a banquet facility as it would require minimal updates before reopening.“That’s a turnkey operation,” Mayor Ryan told the outlet. “It’s ready for any banquet operator.”If the buyer chooses not to use the property to host weddings and other events, Ryan said using the space for retail might be the next best option.The auction for what Levin called an “unusual property” will be held through sealed bids.[DS] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",11535 South Cicero Avenue

A bankruptcy trustee hired a broker to sell the struggling eatery and end a long battle between Gouletas and her lenders.The Gouletas venture that owns Cité owes almost $6.1 million to its creditors, including Republic Bank of Chicago, which filed to foreclose on the property in October 2019.Hilco Real Estate has been hired to sell the circular rooftop space. The broker plans to market the property for restaurant operators, but is also willing to sell it to a buyer for residential use because it could be converted into a penthouse condominium.While Gouletas has said she’s close to repaying her $3.6 million debt to Republic, bankruptcy trustee Robert Handler said he wasn’t aware of any deal between Gouletas and the bank.Hilco is moving forward with plans to sell the 5,200-square-foot restaurant, as well as an additional 2,400 square feet of commercial space on the building’s second floor. It isn’t marketing the property with an asking price. A residential conversion could cost the buyer millions of dollars.In the meantime, Cité is open and losing money. According to a recent court filing, the restaurant’s cash flow for March totaled a net loss of $61,075.A decade ago, Gouletas faced a $5.7 million foreclosure on the property. She managed to keep the property by refinancing it with a $3.8 million loan from Republic in 2015.Cité was formally evicted from the building by the Cook County Sheriff in November — just over two years after Republic filed the foreclosure.

A CBRE spokesman declined to comment on the transaction. ExchangeRight and North American Real Estate did not return requests for comment.Investors have put more than $250 million into such businesses in the Chicago metro area over the last several months, with trades of grocery-anchored assets hitting a record high in 2021 according to JLL.Recent deals have handed profits to sellers — making the CBRE deal stand out — with owners such as Broad Reach Retail Partners profiting on deals like an $18 million sale of a Wauconda Jewel Osco to AmCap for $18 million, up from the $14 million the property fetched in 2017. In Crystal Lake, a venture led by New York investor Michael Tsoumpas recently sold a Mariano’s-anchored shopping center for a 40 percent profit in a $36 million deal.The sale also comes as Kroger-owned Mariano’s stores may be under the eye of federal regulators, as the parent company of the approximately 45 Chicago-area seeks to merge with Albertsons.

They have steadily transformed much of northern Illinois’ condo stock into rentals.Klor’s latest deal for the building at 200 North Dearborn Street in the Loop could close by the end of the year, said Jon Taylor, owner of the 47th floor penthouse at the property.Taylor said he supported the sale in an election held by the property’s condo association board, although the decision wasn’t unanimous, meaning some of its residents are being forced into selling against their will.City law allows a buyer to close on an entire condo building in Chicago without all of its unit owners on board if an offer is approved by owners holding at least 85 percent of a building’s value, giving those who object no choice but to relinquish their units.Aaron Robinson, a 37-year-old United Airlines employee who works at Willis Tower and has been a unit owner at the building on Dearborn for three years, said the ballot on the sale made the 85 percent threshold by just two vote. He was disappointed by the approval and the process that led up to it, which he and another resident said included offers not made in writing of additional cash beyond the value of their units from Strategic Properties to convince owners to vote in favor of the deal.“For me, it’s just a fantastic location downtown,” Robinson said. “The idea of selling and leaving was a little crazy for me, especially right now as mortgage rates are rising and after I refinanced at the bottom of the mortgage market during Covid.”Klor, whose Strategic Properties didn’t respond to requests for comment, is CEO of the city’s most prolific condo deconversion buyer. The company also is working to close a $190 million record-breaking purchase of the condo building at 10 East Ontario Street that’s been delayed by litigation.The Dearborn building was a prime target for a deconversion sale because it was originally developed as apartments in 1989 and turned into condos in the 2000s, and most of the units are now investor-owned and rented out to their residents. Such condo building ownership structures became more common after the 2008 financial crisis caused the Chicago condos market to crash, making them less appealing to live-in owners and leaving investors with plans to run rental businesses as a way to pick up the pieces.Deconversion sales started appealing to investors as condo unit values fell short of their levels from before the Great Recession and multifamily rents soared, making condo buildings far more valuable when run as a single-owner apartment property asset than the sum of the unit values as individually owned homes. The phenomenon has allowed deconversion buyers to make offers to condo owners above-market from what they would get out of an individual unit’s sale.Some condo lawyers have criticized the lack of guardrails governing the condo deconversion process in Illinois, which have led to a dearth of clarity surrounding the legality of buyers performing backroom negotiations with unit owners to reach the supermajority of votes needed to close a deal.A condo board member for 200 North Dearborn and KSN, the law firm representing the condo board, didn’t respond to requests for comment.For Taylor, the penthouse owner who purchased the unit that had been left as raw space and poured cash into finishing the home, the deal provided an exit from the property he’d been seeking since moving to Park City, Utah, and a path to the building undergoing much-needed improvements unlikely to be funded by the condo owners.“The buyers reached out directly to me, and we spoke about how to try and get the deal through,” Taylor said. “They really didn’t play too much hardball. I came in very honestly, saying here’s what it’s worth, here’s what I spent. They came back with an honest assessment.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",200 North Dearborn Street

It had been listed since May and under contract since July.A filming location website describes the owners, who records show are Richard and Jill Stockard, as film friendly and says the home has been used for filming by the shows “Chicago PD” and “Empire.”The home attracted major agents on both sides of the deal, with Jeff Lowe of Compass representing the seller and Matt Leutheuser and Tim Salm with Sotheby’s International Realty representing the buyer.Lowe’s group is at the top of The Real Deal’s first Chicago residential broker ranking, with $381.42 million in yearly sales. Leutheuser and Salm represent some of the city’s most well known listings — including the late Richard Driehaus’ mansion that was used in a scene in John Hughes’ “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” as well as the 25,000-square-foot, $45 million listing for a Lincoln Park property that is not currently active but considered the most expensive home in Chicago.Neither agent responded to a request for comment.Last year, a six-bedroom home in the Bucktown neighborhood sold for $3.725 million, the priciest sale in the neighborhood of 2021. That likely makes this $4.4 million home a new all-time record for the area, barring any private, off-market transactions.The property sold last year, at 1622 Wolcott, was developed by Stratum Builders, and the $4.4 million property was developed by Chicago-based Environs, founded by Ken Brinkman.According to reports published at the time of the sale of 1622 Wolcott, the record price for a home near Bucktown came in 2015, when a new five-bedroom contemporary mansion sold for $4.819 million.Correction: This story was updated to correct the developer of 1622 North Wolcott Avenue.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1743 N Wolcott Avenue

Driehaus, who died in March 2021, bought the home in the mid-1980s and did a complete renovation.Tim Salm and Matt Leutheuser of Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty are representing the property.This listing is the third in his estate to hit the market since his death in March of 2021. Earlier this year, his Lake Geneva mansion sold for $36 million, more than the sum of the second- and third-priciest homes in the area, after three months on the market. Another mansion he owned on North State Parkway has been on the market since July with a $4.9 million ask.In 1986, the house was used to film a brief exterior shot of the fictional Chez Quis restaurant in John Hughes’ “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.” The side entrance of the home, which opens onto West Schiller Street, can be seen in a seconds-long shot. The scene was filmed before Driehaus transformed the home and its exertion appearance is quite different today.The home has two main living rooms and features vintage ornamental plaster on the walls and ceilings, herringbone-patterned hardwood floors and multiple grand chandeliers.It also features two staircases. One, is a marble and wrought iron staircase in the main entry and is capped by a stained-glass skylight. The second features an art-deco design, which was inspired by the French liner S.S. Normandie.A glass-wrapped conservatory/sun room on the top level of the home opens onto a large rooftop deck. There is also an elevator that serves every level of the home.This is the second active listing to hit the market in the Chicago area that once served a Hollywood film site.

Passerby on Randolph and LaSalle Streets either love it or hate it.","[""Evan Jahn and the Thompson Center (LinkedIn, Chicago Architecture Center, Getty Images)There’s little middle ground among Chicago residents and architecture critics on the James R. Thompson Center, which Google bought for $105 million as developer Mike Reschke revamps the spaceship-shaped building in the next three years. Passerby on Randolph and LaSalle Streets either love it or hate it.The 37-year-old, 1.2-million-square-foot conical building was designed by the late Helmut Jahn, who created an open interior atrium as a symbol of government transparency because it housed state offices.Now Jahn’s only child, Evan Jahn, 43, is president of the eponymous architecture firm long helmed by his father, who died in a bicycle accident last year at 81. Shortly after his death, Reschke, whose interest in reviving the property helped persuade Google to fill the entire building, phoned the younger Jahn to ask for details about the building and ideas on how to reposition it.Jahn, who isn’t an architect, soon accepted an invitation for his firm to lead the redesign of the building, whose single-paned glass walls offered poor insulation in summer and winter and costs $17 million a year to operate.Even at the news conference to announce the Google purchase, some people were joking about how much state workers didn’t like the building, Jahn said in an interview. Yet the plans by Reschke’s Prime Group “dissolved a lot of those conversations and arguments against why the building was unfavorable,” he said.Read on for more details from Jahn on how the property will be transformed, why it’s unlikely the 110-story tower addition proposed by his father five years ago will come to pass and how architectural firms are reacting to waning demand for office space. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.The building is going to be enhanced to a level and expectation of a 21st century office, in terms of its operating efficiency, its daylight and its ventilation. The facade obviously has to change, based off of present day energy codes. People see it as this big glass building, but because it’s a lot of mirrored glass and opaque panels, they fail to realize it’s only about 25 percent visible glass, aside from the atrium glass wall. Most offices nowadays are closer to 60 or 70 percent visible glass, and we will bring it closer to that.But we’re very enthusiastic to reinvestigate the opportunities for the Thompson Center now almost 40 years later. Because the technology has evolved that allows the building to showcase its potential for experimentation of what an office building can embody, not just from a metaphorical stance but actually now that we’re in this post-pandemic office hybrid work routine, to have more open space, more relationship with the outside, more opportunities for fresh air and collaboration space. It’s undeniable that it’s an iconic building and its interconnectedness with the city is inseparable.You would have to talk to the developer group about that. I don’t think anything is changing based on what’s been discussed. There have been a lot of ideas thrown around about putting a tower on the site. Those were very conceptual or pre-concept sort of ideas put out there.As you saw with the Google announcement, the Chicago central business district is actually performing quite well and has a lot of velocity, and trajectory is quite promising. When you have a single deal that takes 10 percent of the vacancy off the market, it’s pretty amazing. It’s not to neglect the fact there is a lot of available space on the market. I’m not trying to say we know the market as intimately as the development profession, but it seems and I agree with the assessment that there is a lot of downsizing and shifting in the market. Offices aren’t necessarily leaving, but that’s creating in the aggregate a net addition of vacancy. There is still a high demand for people to want to be in urban environments, if we can keep them safe, which, overall, the safety of cities has increased dramatically since the 1990s.They’re beyond a bellwether. They’re really almost setting a new precedent in how they’re defining the workplace, with their projects in multiple areas. They’re really trying to reconceptualize this 21st century hybrid work environment. What I think is consistent is Google is all about movement and the fluidity of being able to choose your space, being able to quickly go to other parts of the building to meet with another department or colleague and breaking down those barriers that used to be a maze of cubicles. What you see the hybrid workforce demanding is a lot of spaces that are analogous to the comfort of working in a personal space like home. There is this mobility throughout the day that helps people’s focus and creativity.It’s important to have a very transparent and dignified relationship with a client. A lot of trust allows for a lot of fluid and frank flow of conversation about design and expectations. Hallmarks of our practice have always been to have a very close relationship with our clients and listen to them, help inform and educate them, but in the end, they’re our client, and we listen. But at the same time they’re coming to us for our architectural perspective. It’s our duty to give them our perspective, but it always ends up being a collaboration between what our ideas and knowledge are, and what their vision is. I would be doing anyone in development a disservice if we didn’t propose and push for something that is greater than what initially is the expectation. Like many things in life, you think you can run a mile this fast, and then someone challenges you to run a little bit faster and you figure out you can.

In situations like this, homeowners are less likely to sell their homes, buy new ones or invest in improvements, he said.A second quarter report from the Illinois Association of Realtors stated there was a 6 percent year-over-year decrease in home sales during April. There was, however, a 1.2 percent year-over-year increase in sales price, indicating home value may slowly be on the rise.The overall trend, Lazzara told Crain’s, is reflective of an underfunded pension system, a perceived crime issue and a decreasing population, factors that lead to a decrease in homeownership demand.

The sellers purchased the home with a title and trust company, and are not listed in Cook County records.The sellers bought the home for $5.2 million in 2011 and previously listed it in 2013 and 2014 for $7.6 million. It was the 14th to sell for at least $7 million this year in the Chicago metropolitan area, not including all off-market or private transactions.The luxury market, especially high-end suburbs like Winnetka, hasn’t slowed to the same degree as other areas of Chicago, even as mortgage rates rise in tandem with concern a recession is on the way. The town has one of the area’s most expensive listings, a 1902 home seeking $16 million that sits on 1.75 acres and includes 151 feet of Lake Michigan beachfront.Winnetka has been the center of controversy in recent weeks after city officials dropped plans to build a seawall between a public beach and local billionaire Justin Ishbia’s property after public outcry.

Residential construction also fell 20 percent, to $419 million.Those statistics, from research firm Dodge Data & Analytics and cited by Crain’s, illustrate how dramatic the impact of the coronavirus has been on the local economy.“The April starts data is definitely sobering, but also very much expected,” Dodge’s chief economist Richard Branch said in a statement. “The near shuttering of the economy during April had a significant negative effect on the construction industry, leading to delays in both ongoing projects as well as those about to break ground.”According to Crain’s, Dodge had already forecast a 10 percent decline in Chicago-area starts in 2020 from the year prior. And while Chicago, like many areas of the country, has just begun to reopen, it will likely take many months or years for the economy to recover.Though Gov. J.B. Pritzker largely allowed construction to continue as an essential industry, developers and lenders are pressing pause on many projects as a result of the virus and the state of the economy.In March, The Real Deal reported that the projects most likely to be canceled were hotels and buildings built on spec.

Residents were given five days’ notice to evacuate the building after 33 Realty missed the Nov. 5 deadline.During a building inspection on Oct. 22, the village of Oak Park found that the floors throughout the building had an unusual slope — something residents had noticed before. “When you take out a shopping cart in the front, it rolls down,” resident Joyce Brown told ABC 7.The inspector noted that in the front and back units of the building, the floors had slopes as steep as three or four inches. An unfinished unit in the rear of the building also had a cracked concrete floor.A structural engineer hired by building management made note of the same problems in the building, but couldn’t issue an official opinion without doing a full analysis. That process could take up to a month to complete and could require the floors to be opened up to fully examine the building’s structure.“The safety and well-being of our residents is our only priority,” Eric Weber, one of the owners of 33 Realty, which took over management of the building just two months ago, told the Chicago Sun-Times. “Every resident has been contacted in person or in writing. And they’ve been notified they have a place to live.”However, residents of 930 North Boulevard, who just paid rent for their apartments, say the property manager is reportedly not answering or returning calls from the tenants. Additionally, the manager hasn’t submitted a required evacuation plan with the village either.“We’ve heard nothing. We’ve left voicemails, emails,” Denise Eugenides, who flew in to help her 85-year-old mother who lives in the building, told ABC 7. “We are at a loss.

Morgan St. The project is one of 19 multifamily developments planned or under construction in Fulton Market. One reason for the staggering growth: Google and other tech companies moved into the area within the last several years.“With its strong pipeline of incoming corporate headquarters, innovative retailers and promising tech ventures, the area now needs more multifamily options that can accommodate a young, modern workforce,” Sterling Bay CEO Andy Gloor says in a statement.The additional apartments, and the tenants they bring, will likely transform the neighborhood, with additional density and a modern neighborhood where residents have access to housing, jobs and retail. The new residents also will put additional strains on infrastructure.Sterling Bay is also planning three more buildings with 1,371 apartments in the neighborhood, one at 1245 W. Fulton St. and two at 1300 W. Carroll St. Related Midwest is constructing a 43-story, 300-unit apartment tower at Randolph and Peoria streets. And a venture led by Chicago developer Tom Roszak is building a 27-story, 375-unit project at Randolph and Elizabeth streets, and Shapack Partners is planning two Fulton Market projects totaling 591 apartments, while Fulton Street Cos. plans two buildings with 833.Much of the boom came because Fulton Market lifted a residential zoning ban last year.The projects in the planning stages aren’t a done deal. Rising interest rates, increased construction costs, city approval and a recession could all factor into whether they will actually be developed.Rents in the downtown area continue to climb, while other cities are still rebounding from pandemic departures, data show.The average rent in Chicago was $2,332 a month in January 2022.

It is now,” said Craig Rupp, CEO of Sabanto, an agricultural-technology startup with 10 employees whose office is a few blocks from the site of the shooting.Chicago had 836 murders in 2021, the most since 1994. Shootings rose 9 percent, topping 3,500 for the second time in five years. Carjackings jumped 30 percent to 1,836, three times the total in 2019, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner.Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot acknowledges the rise in crime and her office is working with companies “to ensure Chicago is a safe place to work and live for everyone.”“Public safety is Mayor Lightfoot’s number one priority and World Business Chicago are in constant contact with both current and potential future employers about what steps the city is taking to address the national trend in violent crime,” said a spokeswoman for Mayor Lightfoot.The city’s assurances aren’t enough for some companies. Steven Galanis, CEO of Cameo, an e-commerce company, recently brought about 70 workers back to an office in the Merchandise Mart, only to see a mugging and shooting in the first few weeks.“These things didn’t happen before,” Galanis said on twitter. “Now they’re happening.”Galanis, who moved to Miami during the pandemic, said more than a dozen employees in Chicago moved out of town.“It may have started with CEOs and investors leaving, but now it’s rank-and-file employees,” he said. “It’s gotten worse, especially in the last six months,” he said.[Crain’s] – Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

LaSalle St. beginning in July, according to Crain’s.News of its space-shedding plans follows the news that Groupon is trying to unload 150,000 square feet of space at its headquarters at 600 W. Chicago Avenue.The sublet plans could signal a wave of layoffs at CareerBuilder; its rival ZipRecruiter furloughed and laid off about one-third of its staff in late March.CarerBuilder downsized its footprint at Onni Group’s tower from about 162,000 square feet after it was bought in 2017 by Apollo Global Management and Ontario Teachers’ Pension fund. The firm renewed its lease at 200 N. Lasalle in 2018, but took about half the space it previously had, Crain’s reported.Prior to the pandemic, Chicago’s office leasing market was in good shape. In 2019, companies absorbed more space in downtown than any year since 2007.The rise in availability in the office sublet market will also depress prices for the new product that has recently come online or is expected to hit the market in the next two years.

Interior designer Kara Mann and private equity firm Left Bank Holdings took 4,000 and 2,000 square feet, respectively, at the same building.A tenant the company declined to identify, who R2’s Zack Cupkovic said is a well-known Chicago artist and designer, also signed a lease for a 16,000-square-foot space at 1315 North Branch Street, which Hines bought for $47 million earlier this year, though R2 still handles its leasing. Additionally, recruiter Eight Eleven Group expanded its 4,000-square-foot office footprint to 10,000 square feet at R2’s 770 North Halsted Street.“There aren’t a ton of tenants in the market right now, to be candid, for office, but the ones that are in the market, they don’t want to be in the Loop,” Cupkovic said, adding that those tenants want something more boutique than an office in a high-rise.Cupkovic said the flurry of leasing is a counterpoint to Chicago’s office market as a whole. The city’s total leasing dropped to its lowest level in more than a year in the third quarter, with transactions totaling 1.8 million square feet, according to a report from Savills.R2 started buying property on Goose Island in 2014. In 2017, the city approved zoning changes for the area to allow residential and office development outside of a district that remains solely zoned for industrial buildings. Cupkovic said about 140,000 square feet of its 200,000 square feet of available office space is leased. The company also owns and has repositioned the Morton Salt Shed as a performance venue with some office spaces, which Cupkovic said has 100,000 square feet of its 120,000 square feet leased.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1200 North Branch Street

02:00 PM","New Mayor Lori Lightfoot had a pointed message for the real estate industry moments after she was sworn into office Monday: The city’s shrinking stock of affordable housing is your problem, too.","[""Lightfoot giving inaugural address (Credit: Getty Images)New Mayor Lori Lightfoot had a pointed message for the real estate industry moments after she was sworn into office Monday: The city’s shrinking stock of affordable housing is your problem, too.“Long-term residents, whether homeowners or renters, should not be forced out of their neighborhood when it goes through a period of transformation,” Lightfoot said. “And developers can no longer skip their responsibilities by taking tax dollars but leaving it to someone else to solve our affordable housing crisis.”The line, which came about halfway through her 40-minute inaugural address, was an apparent shot at the two new tax increment financing districts created by the lame-duck City Council last month, which could use up to $2.4 billion in combined tax dollars to fund new infrastructure around the Lincoln Yards and The 78 mega-projects.Lightfoot, then the mayor-elect, had called on aldermen to delay approval of the two districts but later backed down. At the time, she told development giants Related Midwest and Sterling Bay to “enjoy this moment in the sun, because you’re never going to get a deal like this again out of the city of Chicago as long as I’m mayor,” according to the Chicago Sun-Times.But despite the tough talk, Lightfoot included a line in her speech sure to delight builders accustomed to lengthy permitting and approval processes.“We need to cut the red tape and obstacles and instead promote the building of new units and have flexibility in our building code so that innovative housing forms can come on line,” Lightfoot said.Specifically, that means the city should “consider allowing tiny homes and coach houses in zoning changes,” according to a116-page transition report her staff released last week.The report went on to propose a “transparent timeline for planning proposals to move to approval,” with the city’s planning department taking over some of the permitting responsibilities traditionally owned by aldermen.Building more affordable housing was a central plank in the sweeping agenda Lightfoot laid out Monday, which also included calls to snuff out gun violence and root corruption from City Hall.Under her watch, the city housing department will be charged with fostering “the growth of housing that is affordable all over this city,” she said during her speech.Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor and attorney for the private firm Mayer Brown, had scarcely registered on the radar of real estate industry donors before her surprise first-place finish in the Feb. 26 election. But when it became a one-on-one runoff against Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, high-profile developers and builder groups rallied to her side en masse.Now, developers are watching closely to see how she’ll shape the city’s contested Affordable Requirements Ordinance, which requires developers to charge reduced rents on up to 20 percent of units in new apartment buildings proposed in gentrifying parts of the city. Builders have decried the rules as too punitive, blaming them for at least a dozen scuttled development plans in the past 1½ years.In their transition memo, Lightfoot’s team pledged to hang on to the ordinance but signaled they were open to changes. The city should “convene a task force of developers, advocates and Community Development Financial Institutions” to brainstorm “impactful changes” to the policy, the document reads.But the biggest shock for new development could be Lightfoot’s central campaign pledge to end “aldermanic privilege,” the unwritten City Council rule that gives aldermen near-total power over new construction in their own wards. The change could open an avenue for builders, especially developers of affordable housing, to sidestep opposition from neighbors who oppose their plans.It could also make it harder for aldermen to abuse their offices, as when Alderman Ed Burke (14th) allegedly blocked the owner of a Burger King franchise from landing a driveway permit until he hired Burke’s private law firm.Hours after delivering her address, Lightfoot signed an executive order putting a limit on the aldermen’s authority over licensing and permits.“This does not mean our Aldermen won’t have power in their communities,” Lightfoot said during her speech. “It simply means ending their unilateral, unchecked control over every single thing that goes on their wards.”“Alderman will have a voice, not a veto,” she added.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The 150-foot-long display inside Riverside Investment & Development’s office tower combines art, architecture and technology, featuring works of Chicago artists and those from around the world, all-but stopping visitors in their tracks.Called 150 Media Stream, the attention-grabbing display is also one of a growing number of art installations in commercial and residential developments around Chicago that tap into the digital age. The flashy works come at a time when competition among developers and property owners has intensified to differentiate their projects and cater to the changing needs of a new generation of tenants.“The art budgets do appear to be increasing,” said Gail Lissner, managing director at consulting firm Integra Realty Resources. “As new buildings get built, developers are raising the bar. It’s another item for them to stand above the crowd.”The displays can also be a not-so-subtle way to reimagine and throw a spotlight on an existing building, as in the September debut of “Art on the Mart.” That project has turned Vornado Realty Trust’s 4 million-square foot Merchandise Mart into a massive digital projection screen. Five days a week for two hours a day, the river-facing facade is a canvas for public art, with thousands of onlookers staring at and taking photos of the 88-year-old art deco building.Artwork has long been a prominent feature in large developments around the city, particularly in downtown office buildings, though the focus has leaned more traditional. That was also the case with Lendlease’s 29-story Cooper at Southbank apartment building in Printers Row, which opened in September at 720 South Wells Street. The Cooper features work from artist Nick Albertson, whose abstract photography hangs in the lobby of the 452-unit building. Lendlease also commissioned 10 original pieces from artist David Wolske for the larger Southbank development.As with many new developments around the Chicago, the Cooper is loaded with amenities like a “namaste nook” for private yoga lessons and a grill deck with rain-resistant widescreen TVs suspended above each grate.But while those features are only for tenants, high-tech art displays are taking on a more central role because they can also serve as a form of public advertising in the digital age, developers and real estate experts said.Tony Scacco, at Riverside Investment, said other factors were also at play to explain their recent prominence. The first is that the battle to ink large leases at Downtown developments has heated up, and the second is the pressure to meet the changing demands and desires of tenants.More corporations are moving offices to Downtown, in part to attract the Millennial labor pool, Scacco said. That is a generation whose living and working habits have led developers to alter their offerings and amenities. That shift comes at a time when the suburban office market has hit a skid. The vacancy rate for that market crept up to 23.7 percent at the end of the second quarter, the highest it’s been since 2014, according to JLL.“There’s just been fundamental changes with the manner in which companies of all types are using their office space,” Scacco said. Since the financial downturn, he said, companies have had to completely rethink how to attract Millennials. That hasn’t happened “for any generation previous.”For developers — office and residential — that has meant a smaller, more dense living or working space, with more of an emphasis on amenities and features that offer “experiences,” like a rooftop terrace or a massive art installation.“What we’re trying to do is create a unique and amenity-robust environment within which our clients can recruit and retain” employees, Scacco said.Standing outTaris Real Estate’s 900 West Washington luxury condo building is another new development using digital art technology, this one to help create an identity in a crowded market.When completed, the 22-unit development in the changing West Loop neighborhood will include a lobby grand chandelier that doubles as a digital art installation, creating a whirl of color and light in the lobby that will project onto the building’s street-facing windows. Units will cost between $1.4 to $5.5 million.That West Loop area has been setting records in the $1 million and over residential market, according to a Re/Max third quarter report. There were 43 sales of attached units in that luxury category through the end of October, compared to 16 last year and none five years ago.As the prices climb higher, buyers expectations can also rise, for something bigger and better.“It’s a recent trend to be more interactive,” said Taris’ Patrick Buck. “We wanted the building to look aesthetically good now and also fit into the community 20 years from now.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",150 Media St

The John Buck Company already signed Facebook to a 263,000-square-foot lease in its recently completed CNA Center and Google is looking to add another 100,000 square feet of office space in Fulton Market.

09:22 AM",Adventus Realty Trust is turning around a Chicago-area office building near O’Hare airport that lost two big tenants last year to leave it 60 percent empty.,"[""Adventus’ Rodney Johnston and 5600 North River Road (LinkedIn, Adventus)Adventus Realty Trust is turning around a Chicago-area office building near O’Hare airport that lost two big tenants last year to leave it 60 percent empty.The Vancouver, Canada-based landlord of 3 million square feet of offices across suburban Chicago struck a deal with Chicago Mortgage Solutions to lease 55,000 square feet in the Columbia Center in suburban Rosemont, people familiar with the negotiations told The Real Deal.It was a win for Adventus to refill a space left empty by kitchenware maker Corelle Brands, which had based its offices there for years until exiting in December, just as the building’s anchor tenant, exercise equipment company Life Fitness, also left a 95,000-square-foot lease to move to an office twice that size in suburban Franklin Park. Adventus is also in talks to reload half the Life Fitness space with a new tenant by next month, said the landlord’s COO, Rick Charlton.“It looks like we’re going back into the teens for the Columbia Center’s vacancy rate by year-end at the latest,” Charlton said in an interview. “The market is so big in Chicago, you’re always going to have some structural vacancy, which we peg around 10 percent that’s constantly going to be there. In our Class A office submarket, we’re closer to 17 or 18 percent vacant right now. Our assets are generally outperforming the market.”While suburban Chicago’s office vacancy ticked up to record highs in five straight quarters as of earlier this year, hitting 27 percent in April, filling the Corelle space within months shows the resilience of suburban assets in easy to access locations and the draw of being next door to O’Hare International Airport, the world’s fourth-busiest. The overall market’s vacancy rate is being driven up by low-quality assets in hard-to-reach areas.Adventus bought the three-building, 620,000-square-foot Columbia Center complex on North River Road and West Bryn Mawr Avenue in 2014 for $93.1 million, when it was nearly full, and drew concern early this year from ratings agency DBRS Morningstar over its $41.8 million commercial mortgage-backed security loan against the former Life Fitness building when its two largest tenants exited.“As the risks have significantly increased from issuance, with market challenges that could mean those risks are sustained at an increased level for the longer term,” a January report on the loan said.Even with those issues alleviated by the lease with the residential mortgage company and 12 others totaling 125,000 square feet across Adventus’ suburban Chicago buildings in the past seven months, plus the potential deal to replenish the Life Fitness space, the landlord isn’t necessarily out of the woods. Its portfolio includes a distressed property in suburban Oak Brook that Adventus may surrender.Read on to learn more from Charlton about how his company is dealing with that property and why it spent almost $12 million during the pandemic to add dozens of spec suites and upgrade lobbies, fitness centers and food services. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.We’re likely to let it go back to the lender. We’re in that process right now and it’s very cooperative. We’ve found a potential purchaser for it, so there could be a short sale. It’s unfortunate and none of us are happy with that. But it was just a business decision. It’s not reflective of the health of Adventus. We just did a $350 million financing last year with Credit Suisse using CMBS debt. The company is not the issue.We’ve just redone and upgraded every lobby in all three Riverway buildings and are in the process of finishing work in the auditorium. It’s a totally different asset today than it ever was. We had a broker reception a couple weeks back there, and one of the guys said Riverway used to be the place to be and then it just got old, but that we’ve brought it back. Our vision of Riverway is working. There is a flight to quality and we’re the quality.(Plans included) the development of over 24 rent-ready suites to date with 90 percent leased or under negotiation. Additional rent-ready suites are under construction. Their cost is approximately $3.3 million. A lot are smaller, anywhere from 1,500 to 5,000 square feet. The rent-ready suite program and investment in our assets was initiated mid-Covid anticipating a flight to quality and the need for move-in ready suites, all of which is now bearing fruit.Our Atlanta portfolio is currently at its lowest vacancy level, 6.2 percent, in the past five years. I hear a lot of negativity about suburban offices but we’re loving it right now. Our leasing strategy has achieved positive results with approximately 238,000 square feet of leasing overall completed in Chicago and Atlanta since November 2021. We consider this to be exceptional, particularly given the challenges the economy faces coming out of Covid.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",5600 North River Road

The building is stained with the Sears logo (Credit: iStock)A possible Sears bankruptcy could mean the end for the 125-year-old retail legend and yet another headache for the nation’s shopping mall owners.A Sears bankruptcy could leave malls already dealing with the loss of major tenants like Carson’s with massive amounts of additional vacant space. Even worse, the malls would be losing an anchor tenant that for decades has successfully drawn shoppers to malls, according to a report in Crain’s.Sears is just the latest retail giant that’s struggled to adapt to the rise in e-commerce. With the company in debt more than $5 billion, Sears executives this week began preparing for a possible bankruptcy filing, leaving the future of its 900 remaining stores in doubt.A bankruptcy could lead to liquidation, meaning Sears would join Carson’s and Toys ’R’ Us among the bix-box retailers forced to shutter thanks to changing consumer habits.Malls are already feeling the crunch. The vacancy rate at malls nationwide hit a seven-year-high in the third quarter, and average mall rents slid for the first time since 2011. The closing of certain Sears stores was cited as one of the reasons for the high vacancy rate.The combined loss of Carson’s and Sears is leaving gaping holes at some shopping malls, which are having to get creative in order to fill the space.A mall in suburban Chicago, for example, is considering adding apartments, a hotel or medical offices. Some malls in markets like Chicago and Los Angeles have turned to co-working spaces and business parks to fill former anchor spaces.Complicating the redevelopment of shuttered Sears locations is that the retailer owns many of its stores, including in malls. Sears’ real estate arm, Seritage Growth Properties, has generated billions for the company by selling off Sears real estate assets, but it’ unclear what would happen to Seritage under a bankruptcy filing, Crain’s reported.\xa0[Crain’s]\xa0— Joe WardAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

(Credit: Google Maps)Chicago’s hotel occupancy rate inched higher for the fifth straight week since bottoming out in late March, but the overall figure remains staggeringly low, with the city still essentially under quarantine.The new data showed the occupancy rate stood at 24.2 percent, up from its low-point of 16.1 percent from March 22-28, according to hospitality research firm STR. Average daily room rate crept up to $72.70 and revenue per available room also hit a five-week high of $17.61.To put the current crisis in perspective, the occupancy rate is down 67 percent from the same time last year, daily room room rate is down 53 percent and RevPar is down about 85 percent.While Gov. J.B. Pritzker this week outlined a path to broader retail and office reopenings statewide, he said Illinois was only on Phase 2 of his five-phase plan. High-density Chicago would likely be among the last to unlock its doors.For the hard-hit hospitality industry, a handful of hotels in downtown Chicago have benefited from the city’s program to pay for rooms to house frontline workers and coronavirus patients. The plan was to free up hospital beds, and to boost the battered hotels. But that program may be ending soon — a bit of good news, given the need — with roughly half of the 875 rooms Chicago has been paying since late March now empty. Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s office said it would not rent additional rooms — the plan was to rent up to 2,000 a night — and is “in the process of assessing our needs going forward.”In the city’s central business district, which has been decimated, the occupancy rate slipped to 13.4 percent, according to the latest STR figures. That’s a few percentage points below what it had been the previous week and 83 percent below the same time last year. Average daily room rate stood at $102.69 — a slight improvement from the week before — while RevPar dropped a few cents to $13.77.Some city hotels have also been trying to transform unused rooms into makeshift offices.Rooms at the 221-key Godfrey are available for rent during the day, for $52, and the budget Red Roof Inn was offering its rooms to office workers for $29 a day.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Its partner, Miami-based Lennar Corporation, will put up a seven-story apartment building with 300 units on the 4.1-acre triangular property bounded by Elston Avenue, Webster Avenue and Metra’s UP-North line tracks, not far from Sterling Bay’s planned Lincoln Yards megadevelopment.The condominium units range in size from about 1,200 square feet and 2,100 square feet. They start at $516,000 for a smaller two-bedroom unit. More than 25 percent of the condos in the building are already under contract, according to Belgravia.A third building offering retail space is also planned for the project.In late 2018, Belgravia and Lennar paid $21.8 million for the two parcels where they’re building the mixed-use residential development.The firms recently secured a $69 million loan from Wells Fargo for the project.Triangle Square is expected to be completed sometime next year.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1701 West Webster Avenue

Real estate developer Jerald Lasky, who owned the house via a trust that concealed his identity, paid $5.26 million for the home in February 2021.Lasky, who made about a profit of about 10 percent on the sale, first listed the property in June with an asking price of $6.5 million. The listing was taken down two weeks later and the sale was posted at the end of July. The new owner bought the home via a legal entity that conceals their identity.The sale of the home reflects a strong luxury housing market in the Windy City, where 49 homes hit the $5 million threshold, up from 20 in 2020.Built in 1883, the State Parkway home underwent a multiyear renovation and expansion by real estate developers Randy and Steve Fifield after they bought it in 2011 for almost $5 million.The house was the fictional home of the family in the 1980s TV sitcom “Webster,” which starred Emmanuel Lewis playing an orphan adopted by his godparents.In 2016, Chicago native Dwyane Wade, who had just left the Miami Heat for the Chicago Bulls, rented the home as well. Just before Wade’s arrival, it had been listed for $9.5 million. Three years later, in 2019, the home was back on the market, this time asking $7.9 million.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1432 N St

And Mayor Lori Lightfoot has signaled that she would embrace such units, by introducing an ordinance that lifts the ban on ADUs and creating standards on their design.“The administration’s proposed ADU ordinance is not only a way to increase available housing throughout Chicago, it is also a safety and stimulus effort, designed to allow for very gentle density within existing neighborhood character,” Lightfoot’s Department of Housing said. “In fact, if ever the need arises again, ADUs will create a type of density that could allow for multi-generational households to remain close, but also create options for social distancing in a basement unit or coach house on the same property.”Some estimate that Chicago has 2,400 coach houses despite a ban on ADUs since the 1950s. Most were grandfathered in or illegally added afterward.The ULI report said ADUs should be allowed in any residential zoning district as well as any multifamily building with commercial space.Community groups have sounded the alarm over the rate of two- to three-flat buildings being demolished and replaced with single-family homes in recent years.Given the pandemic, it’s unclear when the City Council might take up Lightfoot’s ADU legislation.\xa0[Sun-Times] — James KleimannAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Any projects larger than 10,000 square feet will also be charged a “zoning review” fee.Some other new fees being implemented in the new year focus on ride-hailing services, which could affect commercial real estate in the downtown area.

He was listed as a group leader and was also responsible for reviewing property tax appeals for commercial properties.Kaegi last month won the primary election for Cook County assessor, defeating Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Commissioner Kari Steele, who said Kaegi’s higher commercial valuations were driving business away from Chicago.

The completed 19,000-square-foot complex would include about 4,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and a rooftop deck.The building has sat empty since Humadieh paid $500,000 to buy it in 2004, and its facade has since begun to “buckle and collapse under its own weight,” Englewood operations director Chuck Taylor said.The bone-deep rehab will also involve removing and resetting all the building’s floor plates farther apart from one another, a recurrent challenge in transforming the neighborhood’s 20th-century industrial warehouses into modern office and dining destinations.“It didn’t need very high ceilings as a meatpacking building, but it’s going to need all that space for future use,” Taylor said. “Not just so you can run all the mechanicals, but because that’s what users are looking for right now.”The new facade will mimic its original brick-and-limestone design, he said.When it comes time to court office tenants for the building, the landlord will have to compete with more than a million square feet of new workspace now planned within a stone’s throw of the Google office and adjacent CTA station. The wave of ambitious ground-up projects from developers like Sterling Bay, Shapack Partners and Thor Equities has been enough to pull the city’s overall office demand west of Downtown.But gut rehabs of low-rise warehouses have played an equally big part in the West Loop’s ascendence, especially in its flourishing dining scene. Developers like Convexity have bought up meatpacking plants and turned them into homes for renowned restaurants like Duck Duck Goat, Kuma’s Corner and The Publican.Humadieh’s building, which might include a restaurant in its retail space, will be next door to a nearly 13,000-square-foot food hall soon to be opened by McCaffery Interests at 1115 West Fulton.It also would be next to a building where businessman and strip club owner Perry Mandera in 2014 proposed opening a medical marijuana dispensary until Alderman Walter Burnett (27th) rejected the proposal, according to DNAinfo.Englewood is aiming to have the building ready for tenants by early next year.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1107 West Fulton Street

11:00 AM",A New York investment firm is asking $20 million for a trio of courtyard apartment buildings it bought and gut-renovated in South Shore last year.,"[""DAX Real Estate managing partners Daniel Hedaya and Max Seibald with 7500 South South Shore DriveA New York investment firm is asking $20 million for a trio of courtyard apartment buildings it bought and gut-renovated in South Shore last year.DAX Real Estate paid just under $11.5 million in January 2018 for three complexes with 208 combined units at 7500 South South Shore Drive, 6916 South Clyde Avenue and 7038 South Chappel Avenue, according to Cook County property records.Starting last year, DAX spent “several million dollars” on a complete overhaul of the three buildings, the largest of which on South Shore Drive had been “very rundown and substantially vacant,” managing partner Daniel Hedaya told The Real Deal on Tuesday.The complex was owned by notorious Logan Square landlord Mark Fishman, records show.6916 South Clyde AvenueNoah Birk and Aaron Sklar of the Kiser Group, one of the busiest multifamily brokerages on the city’s South Side, are marketing the buildings on behalf of DAX.The apartment complexes represent a rare “turnkey investment opportunity” in the lakefront neighborhood, which faces Jackson Park to its north and straddles a Metra rail line, Sklar said.Sklar called the area “one of the most appreciating pockets of the South Side.”Prior to the renovations, the 130-unit building on South Shore Drive was about 65 percent occupied. Today, the three buildings have tenants for about 95 percent of their total units, according to the Kiser Group.The units range from studios to three-bedrooms, now renting between $525 and $1,515 each. Most units are one-bedrooms and rent near $1,000 apiece, Sklar said.None of the buildings are bound by affordability agreements with the city or federal housing regulators, meaning future landlords could raise rents as high as they want.The city’s diverse stock of mid-size apartment buildings has become an especially alluring target for out-of-state investors, who have a harder time finding properties on the East and West Coast that generate quick returns, Birk and Sklar said.Real estate buyers typically look at capitalization rates, which are calculated by dividing the income a property generates by its market value, to measure the ripeness of an investment opportunity. Buildings with rates above 6 percent are rare in cities like New York and Los Angeles.Kiser estimates the combined rate for the three South Side properties around 8.3 percent.7038 South Chappel AvenueThe smaller buildings on Clyde and Chappel are both inside Opportunity Zones, meaning a buyer could reap big tax benefits if they can prove to federal regulators that they’ve made a “substantial improvement” to the value of the properties.It’s an unlikely goal for a pair of buildings that were just renovated, but a new landlord could still end up being the “passive beneficiary” of a patchwork of zones that were designated all around them, Sklar said.South Shore logged a median home sale price of $100,000 last month, nearly double its $56,000 median in April 2016, according to Redfin. It’s one of several South Side neighborhoods that recently have found themselves in the crosshairs of single-family home flippers.Along with neighboring Woodlawn, South Shore is seeing a surge of interest thanks to its proximity to the planned Obama Presidential Center, whose future remains in flux amid a pending lawsuit.The spiking home values have led some activists to raise alarms over the potential for long-time residents to be priced out of the area. Freshman Alderman Jeanette Taylor (20th), whose ward includes Woodlawn, campaigned this year on softening the forces of gentrification in the predominantly African-American neighborhood.But Birk said he doesn’t expect the listed apartments to ruffle any feathers among neighbors. Even after the renovations, most units in the buildings are priced at levels geared toward the “working class demographic” of South Shore, the broker said.“There’s a lack of very nice affordable housing on the South Side in general,” Birk said. “These buildings were beaten up and worn down a few years ago, and they were renovated to the level where people actually want to live in them.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",7500 South South Shore Drive

Oak Street for an undisclosed price, just months after original buyer ESG Kullen was slated to close on the condo, according to Crain’s. Strategic finalized the deal in March, the outlet reported.Though it’s unclear when Strategic entered into negotiations, Crain’s reports that New York-based ESG Kullen had pushed back its scheduled closing date multiple times.ESG Kullen had initially agreed to buy the asset in the summer for $92 million, among the largest condo deconversion deals in city history.But large condo deconversions are expected to taper down in Chicago this year. The city passed an ordinance last year that 85 percent of condo owners had to agree to a takeover, up from the prior 75 percent. And although rental units are a better investment these days, deconversion deals are complicated and fraught with headaches.Strategic has been among the few highly-active shoppers in recent months. Apart from its contract buy at 2 E. Oak, it recently acquired a large Streeterville apartment complex last month for an undisclosed amount (the building was listed for $160 million). Strategic has deconverted three condo buildings in Chicago, including a $44 million deal at 21 E.

What followed was not an overview of the $6 billion project, but an update on the firm’s efforts to boost diversity in its ranks.","[""Sterling Bay’s “People” webpage from last month versus the webpage nowAbout 10 minutes into a three-hour City Council zoning committee hearing on Sterling Bay’s plan for Lincoln Yards, senior counsel Shelly Burke took to the microphone. What followed was not an overview of the $6 billion project, but an update on the firm’s efforts to boost diversity in its ranks.Burke, the company’s newly-appointed director of community engagement and diversity compliance, described the developer’s new training and hiring programs she said would “create workforce opportunities for all of Chicago.” The only African-American executive out of 28 listed company leaders, Burke spoke as Sterling Bay principals Andy Gloor and Dean Marks, who are both white, sat at the front of the council chamber listening.Afterward, Alderman David Moore (17th) questioned Gloor about the timing of Sterling Bay’s decision to add Burke and five other women to the company’s web page listing executives. He noted it happened only after three members of the Community Development Commission publicly mentioned that 19 of the 21 photos posted on the site’s “Senior Leadership” page were of white men.Moore held up two poster boards showing the difference, prompting Gloor to defend the change.“The reformatting doesn’t change that these people have all been part of Sterling Bay for a number of years,” Gloor said. “They are the most senior individuals with their particular expertise, and that has not changed.”The tense exchange highlighted a persistent challenge the Sterling Bay has faced during the project’s punishing eight-month public approval process that began last summer: Demonstrating that a private real estate company, whose leaders mirror an overwhelmingly white and male-dominated industry, deserves to benefit from a $1.3 billion tax increment financing district\xa0bolstered by taxpayers in a diverse city.The TIF district has not yet been approved by the City Council. But a zoning change for the project advanced through the committee last week, lining up Sterling Bay’s 54-acre master plan for final passage by the council Wednesday. The development is slated to build up to 6,000 apartments and 6 million square feet of commercial and hotel space.Though one of the city’s largest developers, Sterling Bay is hardly the only real estate firm led predominantly by white men. The leadership pages for major developers in Chicago like Hines, CIM Group and McCaffery Interests are all filled mostly with white, male faces.And in an industry composed mostly of privately-owned companies whose hiring practices lean hard on personal relationships, few companies are motivated to upset the status quo, said Megan Abraham, executive director of the Goldie Initiative, a nonprofit aimed at elevating women in commercial real estate.“Until companies are publicly owned, the issue of diversity generally doesn’t emerge, because there’s just no mandate to change,” Abraham said. “The people making decisions are those in leadership, and when that’s a homogenous group of older white men, which is often the case, you’ll find no sense of urgency.”Gloor told Moore during last week’s zoning committee meeting that hiring women- and minority-led contracting firms is “something we’ve consistently done in all our projects in Chicago.” It is also mandated under city code for any new development seeking financial backing from the city.Sterling Bay has faced relentless public scrutiny over Lincoln Yards since last summer, including over how it hires contractors the development. Executives met with critical city officials like Moore, who ultimately voted to approve the zoning change last week.Days before a Feb. 15 Community Development Commission hearing to approve the new tax increment financing request, Sterling Bay published a three-page “diversity and inclusion program statement.” The company has spent the past six months building and sharpening the company-wide plan, a spokesperson said.The statement describes sponsorships in training and mentoring programs and lists members of an “advisory council for diversity and inclusion” who will consult the company on Lincoln Yards. Burke said the advisory council will help Sterling Bay “reach out to all parts of Chicago” to find contractors to work in Lincoln Yards, and will promote from within the firm to help it stand out in an industry “that has been dominated by white males.”The firm also promoted Burke to the position of “director of community engagement and diversity compliance” after she personally asked Dean Marks to consider her for the position, she told the Community Development Commission last month. She was one of five women who had the word “director” added to their titles on the website since last month.But in the fall, Sterling Bay lost a woman director in Erin Lavin Cabonargi, who stepped down as head of development to start her own development and consulting firms. Her position was filled by a man.At the zoning committee meeting, Moore ended his questioning by telling Gloor and other Sterling Bay principals to expect the same scrutiny from the city in the future over its hiring practices. That will be especially true, he said, after the April 2 runoff election, when either Toni Preckwinkle or Lori Lightfoot will become the next mayor, marking a milestone for Chicago.“I think we must continue to make sure we have racial diversity at all levels, not just in the project but at the company level as well,” Moore said. “Because let’s not forget, there’s going to be a new sheriff in town here soon, and that sheriff is going to be an African-American woman.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","28 listed company leaders, Burke spoke as St"

In 2017, he sponsored an expansion of the Affordability Requirements Ordinance that created zones where developers must promise reduced rents on at least 20 percent of their proposed units in order to score higher zoning for any new development.The ordinance was intended “carve out a little piece for school teachers” to be able to afford the neighborhood, where most new apartments now rent for more than $4 per square foot, Burnett told The Real Deal in October. But some developers have lashed out at the new rule, saying it made new construction harder to finance.Still, the ordinance hasn’t stopped builders and architects from paying to beef up his political operation. Real estate groups pumped more than $160,000 into Burnett’s campaign since the beginning of last year, records show.His re-election Tuesday instantly makes him one of the most senior and influential members of the City Council, where a wave of retiring aldermen with more than 100 years of combined experience will make way for a sea of younger faces.So far, Burnett’s name has not surfaced in any of the criminal allegations swarming around veteran aldermen like Ed Burke (14th), Danny Solis (25th) and Ricardo Munoz (22nd), leaving him without a direct public tie to the web of scandals consuming City Hall.And Burnett faced a smoother path to re-election than other longtime council members who have bonded themselves to Emanuel, like Aldermen Pat O’Connor (40th) and Joe Moore (49th), who faced fierce challenges.Burnett out-raised Bednarz during the last year by a 66-to-1 margin.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2012 and laid the foundation for St

Maggio, who officially went to work for @properties on Tuesday, will be based out of its Hinsdale office, helping to drive growth in the western suburbs. The founders of @properties, Thad Wong and Mike Golden, announced the move in a statement.Maggio had more than $25 million in sales volume last year, according to @properties.He became a licensed broker in 2010 and got his start at Keller Williams. Maggio jumped to @properties in 2013, remaining there until 2017, when he moved to boutique luxury brokerage Conlon Real Estate. That became Compass’ first Chicago acquisition in 2018.He focuses on La Grange, Western Springs, Hinsdale, Clarendon Hills and Downers Grove, but also does some work in Chicago’s West Loop, River North, West Town, Bucktown and Wicker Park.Maggio operates on his own, saying he enjoys it “because I think a lot of clients get a little frustrated sometimes when they’re passed off to people. Of Compass, he said, “it was just a lot of bells and whistles and shiny stuff over there that wasn’t necessarily making my life any easier.”In a statement, a Compass spokesperson said: “We respect every agent’s choice in brokerage, and we wish J Maggio the best in his next chapter and in all future endeavors.”Softbank-backed Compass moved into the Chicago market in late 2017. In The Real Deal’s ranking of Chicago’s top residential brokerages by sales volume — from December 2017 through November 2018 — @properties topped the list with more than $6.5 billion, but Compass cracked the top 10, placing sixth with $1.4 billion.Maggio, who shifts to @properties amid the widening coronavirus crisis, said he doesn’t think the timing makes much of a difference in the long run; brokers across the Chicago area are seeing a drastic slowdown in business.“I feel really good about where I’m at, and at the end of the day, it’s all about my clients, right? I want to be in a spot where I can do the best for my clients and the ease of providing them with the best service,” he said.A few months ago, Compass poached one of @properties’ top broker teams, a 10-agent group led by Pam MacPherson and Hayley Westhoff.This updates Compass’ response with a statement from its spokesperson.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The Westin’s price wasn’t released.The deals are the largest distressed hotel sales in the Chicago area since the beginning of the pandemic. As occupancy rates rise almost to pre-pandemic levels thanks to the return of large group gatherings and leisure travel, room rates have surpassed 2019 levels.The Beffort venture bought the Evanston hotel in a consensual short sale, meaning the owner sold the property for less than the value of the debt tied to it with the approval of the lender. The previous owner, Olshan Properties, faced a foreclosure lawsuit last year after allegedly defaulting on its $40 million loan.The $34 million purchase price is less than the almost $39 million loan balance that remains on the Evanston property. It’s also significantly less than the $60 million that Olshan paid for the hotel in 2015.The Westin Chicago Northwest in Itasca is being sold by its lender Oceanview Commercial Mortgage after a contentious legal battle with its former owner GF Hotels & Resorts. It is unknown how much the Beffort venture paid for the property, but its debt was more than $31 million.In Chicago itself, distressed hotels have been hitting the auction block. Last month, Wells Fargo bought the JW Marriott from Orlando-based investment firm Estein USA for $251 million as the sole bidder for the property.A Cook County judge also last month issued an order of foreclosure against New York’s Thor Equities for defaulting on its $333.2 million mortgage on Palmer House Hilton Chicago. The order clears the way for the 1,635-room property, the city’s second-largest after the Hyatt Regency, to be sold for a fraction of its pre-Covid value.Earlier this month, the distressed $44.7 million mortgage on the 228-room Hotel Felix in River North was also marketed for sale, more than a year after the property’s owner was served with a foreclosure suit.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Pritzker, Bob Dunn, Kam Buckner, and a rendering of the One Central megadevelopment (Credit: Glessner House)A group of South Side lawmakers is seeking a seat at the table if the state negotiates a financing deal for Landmark Development’s One Central transit hub, saying community concerns must be addressed before the state approves funding.Four state legislators who represent the area where Landmark is proposing the One Central mega-development sent a letter to Pritzker Friday, complaining they were iced out of the negotiations over how to subsidize Landmark’s proposed transit center.“As representatives of this district, we should have been notified about a project that will affect thousands of our residents,” the letter reads. “We believe that residents should have a seat at the table going forward.”The Illinois General Assembly over the weekend approved a state spending package that included a provision authorizing Prtizker’s administration to negotiate a public-private partnership for Landmark’s proposed $3.8 billion transit hub. The bill does not require the Legislature to ratify any future deal with the developer.Landmark President Bob Dunn sought the partnership as a means of kickstarting the One Central development. His proposal called for the state to reimburse Landmark for the cost of the transit hub over 20 years before it is handed over to the state.An outline of that deal was included in the state spending package, although no official terms have been agreed to, the governor’s office said. The bill approved over the weekend instead allows the administration to negotiate a deal if the development moves forward.State Rep. Kam Buckner said he and other Near South Side representatives weren’t made aware of the One Central language included in the spending bill until the 11th hour. Buckner joined Sen. Mattie Hunter, Sen. Robert Peters and Rep. Lamont Robinson in asking the governor to include the delegation in future One Central talks.“We wanted to be on the record saying we need to be engaged in this process,” Buckner said.Landmark’s One Central development would be anchored by the massive transit center. Initial plans call for as many as a dozen high rises to be built on top of the transit hub, just west of Lake Shore Drive near Soldier Field.The development would rise next to dozens of existing South Loop high rises, and 1,000 residents of those buildings signed a petition against One Central, according to the lawmakers. Those voices should be heard when it comes time to negotiate a deal with Landmark, Buckner said.Though the bill passed Saturday gives his administration the power to negotiate with Landmark, Pritzker would not sign off on a fundraising project without engaging with local elected officials and community leaders, a spokesperson said. Pritzker also will work to address the lawmakers’ concerns that minority contractors and local labor be included in the project, his spokesperson said.Pritzker told the Crain’s editorial board Monday the project would not even get to the negotiating table without a robust community approval process. No part of One Central has been approved by the city or state, as the development firm works to secure potential federal funding for the project.“There’s nothing that’s going to happen here without an awful lot of input from various levels of government,” Pritzker saidl.Landmark’s Dunn has said the firm fully intends a robust community approval process as it seeks to move the project forward. The firm already held one community meeting, where initial plans for the project were announced.“We agree with the legislators that broad community input is essential,” Dunn said in a statement. “Now we will look forward to gathering the input of local residents, civic and community stakeholders, and leaders across the city who will help inform a master plan for One Central, which will be submitted for public review and vetting.”Buckner said he is not against One Central or the proposal to have the state help finance the transit hub. Rather, he just wants to make sure his residents can weigh in on any future deal to provide state funding for it.“People are attracted to the idea of the state owning it and using revenue to pay down things like the pension debt,” he said. “If the numbers add up, I would be all for it.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The new development includes 299 apartments and 80,000-square-feet of retail, among it an Amazon Fresh store.Dubbed District 1860 to honor Abraham Lincoln’s election year, the development is estimated to cost about $175 million. To get all parties to agree to the project, Lincolnwood approved subsidies from part of the property and sales tax revenues generated from it.For half a century, the site was home to the Purple Hotel, which started out as an up-scale Hyatt with live entertainers like Barry Manilow and later became a seedy meeting place for “swingers” events and drug-fueled parties. Tired of the frequent commotion and police calls, the village of Lincolnwood shut it down in 2007. Court battles delayed demolition until 2013.The project was further delayed when Tucker’s original hotel partner walked away from the deal as demand for suburban lodging dwindled during the pandemic. Lakhani Hospitality came on board and reworked the design to reduce the number of rooms to 150 and divide it between the two operators.The village of Lincolnwood pledged up to $3.4 million, which will come from the village’s hotel tax, to Lakhani for construction costs.

The opposition failed to collect enough valid signatures to force a ban. Officials also said such a ban would hurt businesses and taxpayers.Mayor Tom Hayes said the petition, which was submitted by libertarian group Americans for Prosperity Illinois — a group founded by conservative billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch — was a “terrible idea” that would prohibit any kind of tax break, including public parking as it could be considered a financial incentive.The petition was drafted in response to the Chicago Bears considering building a home stadium on the site of the former Arlington International Racecourse, which the NFL team is in contract to buy for $197 million.Team officials have said they wouldn’t seek taxpayer assistance to build the stadium, but would need financial support to build a planned adjoining development. The non-stadium portion of the plan will include housing, offices, retail and entertainment and is expected to cost $5 billion.The petition that Americans for Prosperity Illinios submitted on Sept. 6, had 667 signatures, which is well over the required minimum of 557 — or 1 percent of the population — to be considered by village officials. However, some of the signatures didn’t match registered signatures, had incorrect or no names or belonged to people who didn’t live within Arlington Heights, leaving the petition with only 544 valid signatures.Americans for Prosperity released a poll in August that found that 68 percent of Arlington Heights voters were against using taxpayers funds to support the planned stadium.Brian Costin, deputy state director for Americans for Prosperity Illinois, told the outlet in an email that the group will now focus on getting additional signatures from village residents.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Jim Gardiner.Outside of a community meeting Tuesday night on a proposed $200 million senior living development on the old Sears site at Portage Park’s busy Six Corners intersection, Arena distributed literature and gathered signatures for Ellen Hill, who’s running against Gardiner for Democratic committeeman, the Sun-Times reported Friday. The literature included scripted comments to help area residents hold Gardiner accountable on the issue of affordable housing, Gardiner and other community leaders told the newspaper.Also, Arena allegedly went into the meeting, sat in one of the front rows and gave Gardiner the middle finger.Mayor Lori Lightfoot appointed Arena to the $129,996-a-year job in a Department of Planning and Development, which is supposed to be apolitical, Gardiner argues. He also takes issue with the fact that Arena is playing politics with a planning issue.“How am I supposed to work with a department whose deputy commissioner is actively working against me with current developments going on in the ward?” Gardiner told the Sun-Times.Gardiner said he and many of my colleagues had foreseen that Arena would continue to be “manipulative” and “problematic” in the 45th Ward.Arena couldn’t be reached for comment but a Planning and Development spokesman denied the allegations, saying they’re “unacceptable,” and that the issue had been dealt with internally.At least one resident who spoke to the Sun-Times backed up Gardiner’s story.Last week, news broke of a federal investigation into former Cook County Assessor Joe Berrios and official actions he may have taken, including property valuations, in exchange for a benefit provided to a public official, employee, relative, friend or nominee.[Sun-Times] — Brianna KellyAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Halstead. Molecular engineering tech company Evozyne recently inked a deal for 30,000 square feet, and Vanqua Bio and Exicure have also signed on at the property, which used to be home to the Stanley Manne Children’s Research Institute. Sterling Bay has now leased 50 percent of North Halstead property, according to Crain’s.A spokesperson for Sterling Bay told the outlet that financing for the research center, which would be built along the southern edge of the development, has not been determined. Sterling Bay expects to break ground in early 2021.Sterling Bay’s move follows Trammell Crow’s construction of a 400,000-square-foot life sciences lab in Fulton Market, called Fulton Labs.As Crain’s noted, real estate firms haven’t fully embraced life sciences labs because of the building costs and the difficulty in repurposing the facilities should the tenants leave.Sterling Bay’s $6 billion megaproject received approval from the City Council last year.

But Hazel Crest could help the Calumet Country Club’s new owners pick up the pieces with a redevelopment and annexation plan.,"[""Hazel Crest mayor Mayor Vernard Alsberry and Calumet Country Club (Village of Hazel Crest, Calumet Country Club, Getty)Breaking up is hard to do. But Hazel Crest could help the Calumet Country Club’s new owners pick up the pieces with a redevelopment and annexation plan.Mayor Vernard Alsberry said no formal request has been made for the land just west of his village’s town line, but he is waiting for an official annexation proposal, the Daily Southtown reported. The 130-acre property, located at 2136 175th Street in unincorporated Cook County, separated from the village of Homewood in April 2021.Arizona-based Diversified Partners spent $3.3 million for the golf course in 2020. Diversified broke it off with Homewood after village officials rejected plans to redevelop the property into an 800,000-square-foot warehouse facility. Residents were outraged by the potential impacts of increased traffic and lower property values.Grassroots organization South Suburbs for Greenspace released documents that show Hazel Crest is considering a redevelopment plan that could include a hotel, water park, warehouses or retail space.Alsberry said village officials have been in discussions with Catalyst Consulting, which is pitching a mixed-use development without a large collection of warehouses — a point of importance for Alsberry, who suggested he doesn’t want trucks moving in and out of the village.A development the size Catalyst is proposing would need to secure water and sewer connections from the Hazel Crest. Critics cite this as being one reason the property isn’t ideal for redevelopment.\nVillage attorney John Murphey said the property owners will likely request a tax increment financing (TIF) district, a long process that would involve the village hiring outside consultants first. The village could be reimbursed by the developer for the costs related to the TIF, according to Murphey.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2136 175th Street

10:51 AM","The Chicago City Council has been trying to help clear the competition turbulence around airport hotels, renewing and expanding restrictions on short-term rentals near O’Hare and Chicago Midway airports.","[""Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky (Getty)The Chicago City Council has been trying to help clear the competition turbulence around airport hotels, renewing and expanding restrictions on short-term rentals near O’Hare and Chicago Midway airports.The measures were passed incrementally in recent months and affect precincts — or voting districts — around the airports in the 13th, 23rd and 41st Wards.This comes as Chicago-area hotels continue to wrestle with harsh economic conditions from the pandemic.The approvals mean that all of the precincts in the 13th Ward, which includes the southern section of Midway Airport, have renewed a ban on short-term rentals.Despite rising occupancy, Chicago hotels are projected to generate a total revenue of $346 million this year, an 86 percent drop compared to 2019. That’s according to the American Hotel & Lodging Association. In July, the organization declared Chicago’s lodging industry in a “depression.”RLJ Lodging’s financial reports provide one example of the severity of the squeeze hotels operators are facing.The Maryland-based hospitality REIT owns seven hotels near Midway Airport, including the Courtyard Midway Airport, Fairfield Inn & Suites Chicago Midway Airport and Hilton Inn Garden Chicago Midway Airport. The REIT also owns two hotels in Downtown Chicago. According to RLJ’s annual report, its Chicago properties generated a total revenue of $29.6 million in 2020, a 65 percent drop from the $85.7 million generated in 2019.Marty Quinn, alderman for the 13th Ward and one of the Council’s most vocal Airbnb critics, authored a pair of ordinances that redesignated 21 precincts as restricted residential zones.A precinct can be designated as a restricted residential zone once 25 percent of registered voters in the area sign a petition.The zoning prohibits new short-term rentals in designated areas and hosts who are grandfathered into their precinct’s previous zoning rules are only allowed to operate until their licenses expire. The short-term rental license for a property would also be nullified once the property changes hands.But Airbnb, which points to Chicago as the second-most popular destination for extended stays of 28 days or longer this fall, claims that short-term rentals have a role to play in Chicago’s recovery.“Airbnb drives the benefits of tourism to neighborhoods that need it, said Rachel DeLevie-Orey, a company spokesperson. “And, even in small precincts, the focus should be on facilitating the safe return of travel instead of limiting it.”In the 23rd Ward, the Council banned short-term rentals in the 6th precinct. Last month, it renewed restrictions in eight more precincts: the 1st, 4th, 8th, 18th, 22nd, 23rd, 28th and 29th.The areas covered by the ban include Midway Airport itself, and areas immediately to the west. The largest hotels in the area, located to the south of the airport, include Chicago Marriott Midway, Hyatt Place Chicago and DoubleTree by Hilton Chicago Midway Airport.In the 41st Ward, two precincts near O’Hare — the 14th and the 22nd in Forest Glen and Norwood Park East — were designated as restricted residential zones last July.The expansion of the ban on short-term rentals comes as the city tightens regulations on Airbnb hosts. Under new rules that went to effect in June, owners must now submit registration documents to the city.The old system allowed hosts to register with home-sharing sites, which transmitted documents to the city every two weeks. Property owners can lose their license over one “egregious” incident or two complaints within a year, according to the existing rules. Egregious incidents — which include drug trafficking, prostitution, gang activity or parties — would also result in fines of $5,000 to $10,000.The threat of those incidents has been the justification for much of the opposition to short-term rental companies like Airbnb, VRBO and others. Those opponents have mostly been residents who object to short-term rentals in their neighborhoods.Shortly after the new rule passed, Michele Smith, alderman for the 43rd Ward — covering the North Side including Lincoln Park — said that the legislation will bring relief to her constituents who “have suffered from out-of-control ‘party houses.’”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The property is near Fulton Market District, which has seen an increase in development in recent years.

Since the health crisis, the online-shopping trend has only strengthened, which led Prologis to report higher-than-normal rent collections in the last quarter.The company’s CEO, Hamid Moghadam, is so bullish on the sector overall that he said at a recent webinar that the only thing that could get in the way of the company’s success is if someone were to invent a Star Trek transporter.

Pritzker (Getty)Illinois will phase out its moratorium on evictions starting in August, 18 months after it took effect, and the same time a federal ban ends.Governor J.B. Pritzker said he plans to issue an executive order July 23 allowing eviction filings to begin on Aug. 1, but barring enforcement until Aug. 31. In a statement, the governor’s office urged tenants still unable to keep up with their rent to apply for rental assistance programs that have more than $2 billion in funding.The deadline to apply for aid through the Illinois Rental Payment Program, which received $500 million in funding, is midnight July 18.Pritzker said in May an additional $1.5 billion in housing assistance will be available in coming months.After a year-and-a-half of eviction protection for tenants who lost income during the pandemic, the state is trying to cushion the impact of a return to evictions. For those who do get removed, the court records will remain sealed until the summer of 2022, to give them a chance to find a new apartment without the shadow of eviction hanging over them.“Through a coordinated approach, we hope to relieve the potential pressure on the court system while also ensuring that tenants and landlords have every opportunity to benefit from the state’s rental assistance programs,” Pritzker said in a statement.Grants are slated to cover back rents from July 2020 through June 2021, though rental assistance may also be available for eligible tenants for July, August and September of this year. The maximum grant amount is $25,000.“Households behind on their rent or at risk of eviction shouldn’t wait to get help,” Kristin Faust, executive director of the Illinois Housing Development Authority, said in a statement. “IHDA staff is working to award these funds as quickly as possible to households in need.

The two Chicago firms secured the first building permits in July for the development, which is set to include 226 apartments, office space, 97 parking spaces and 2,300 square feet of ground-floor retail.A three-story loft office building on the site is being preserved and renovated as part of the developers’ plan.Tandam and Rambaud submitted a zoning application for the property in October 2017 and bought the property in March for $11.35 million, according to Cook County records.Last year, Curbed reported the developer would be on the hook for a $1.6 million payment into the city’s Neighborhood Opportunity Fund and will be subject to revised affordable housing rules requiring 20 percent of the units be reserved for tenants earning up to 60 percent of the area median income.Tandem also has plans for two towers with 343 apartments along the north side of the Eisenhower Expressway in the West Loop, according to Crain’s.

The family-owned developer has had an office in the building since 2016 but will take an unspecified amount of additional space to accommodate the relocation.In making the move, Tucker said it wanted to concentrate in one of the city’s most booming neighborhoods, an area where the firm is focusing more of its development efforts.It is also just the latest suburban company to move its operations to Fulton Market, which has the most in-demand office space in the city. Fulton Market has also become increasingly crowded with developer headquarters. Sterling Bay sold its headquarters building this summer for $175 million, the priciest office sale of the year. McCaffery Interests has moved its headquarters to its new office building at 1201 West Lake Street.“That momentum, together with our growing portfolio of city projects under management and development, made now the ideal time to concentrate our operations in this central location,” Tucker’s chief investment officer, Aaron Tucker, said in a statement.In 2017, Tucker unveiled its redevelopment of a square block of historic properties in the 900 block of West Randolph Street. The office space is fully leased, and its retail tenants include Lululemon, Bluemercury and Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams.Earlier this year, Tucker sold a stake in the development known as 900 West, with Asana Partners paying $41.6 million for a portion of the property.Tucker did not include in the sale a Peoria Street-facing parcel where it is planning a 495-foot-tall condo project with Related Midwest.The firm is also working on its District 1860 project in Lincolnwood, where it plans a 220-key hotel, 300 apartments, and 70,000 square feet of retail space. It is slated to be delivered in mid-2021, according to Tucker’s website.That development is the source of a lawsuit between the village of Lincolnwood and Lake Forest Real Estate Capital, which accused the village of steering the project towards Tucker.Tucker also partnered with Sears real estate offshoot Seritage Growth Properties on the redevelopment of a former Sears location on the Northwest Side.The firm will continue to manage its former Highland Park headquarters.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",954 West Washington Boulevard

And Coldwell Banker’s Dawn McKenna brokered the county’s priciest properties from the sellers’ side in back-to-back months.Three of the top five homes were new construction, a new wrinkle compared to July, when none of the most expensive properties that had their details marketed on listing sites were newer than eight years old, and one was first built in 1876. The data was collated by Zillow from information provided by Midwest Real Estate Data and doesn’t include all off-market deals.Read on for more information on the top five.This 9,800-square-foot home sold for $4 million on August 18. Built in 1922, this home has five bedrooms and nine bathrooms. It was sold before it was listed on the public listing sites, and last sold for $3.2 million in 2020. The home was renovated in 2011, and includes a four-car garage, bar and wine cellar. Dawn Mckenna with Coldwell Banker Realty represented both the buyers and the sellers, marking her second month having listed the county’s priciest sale.This 7,300-square-foot home closed for $3.95 million on August 5. Few details about the property are revealed on public listing sites, which appears to be a new construction home on two-fifths of an acre. Before the home was built, the property was listed for $849,000 before closing for $795,000 in June 2020. Coldwell’s McKenna represented the sellers and Cathy Balice with @properties Christie’s International Real Estate represented the buyers.This five-bedroom, six-bathroom home sold for $2.6 million on August 16. It’s is the lone property in the top five outside of Hinsdale. Built in 1970, the home sits on a two-acre estate that includes an in-ground swimming pool. The home has been entirely renovated, according to the listing. It was listed for sale in May for $2.8 million before coming under contract less than a month later. Elaine Zannis with Coldwell Banker Realty represented both the buyer and seller.This new construction home in Hinsdale closed for $2.575 million on August 25. The five-bedroom, five-bathroom home was completed in the first half of this year, according to the listing. It is one of few selling above its asking price in the Chicago suburbs. Originally listed at $2.5 million in November 2020, it’s been under contract since April 2022. Bryan Bomba with @properties Christie’s International Real Estate represented the sellers and Jordan Chalmers with Baird & Warner represented the buyers.This 5,600-square-foot new construction sold for $2.5 million on August 2. The home appears to still be under construction, according to the listing. It includes six bedrooms and six bathrooms, a double kitchen island, rear and front porches, a home gym and rec room.

Chicago Ave (KBS)Two more downtown Chicago office buildings are slated to hit the market as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.KBS Growth & Income REIT, a Newport Beach, California real estate investment trust, announced in regulatory filings that it will begin selling office properties due to financial stress, including two loft offices in Chicago’s River North neighborhood, Crain’s reported, citing CoStar.KBS owns 213 W. Institute Place, a 157,000-square-foot building, and the adjacent parking lot, which it bought in 2017 for $43.5 million, according to Crain’s. It also owns a 16,000-square-foot building at 210-216 W. Chicago Ave.If KBS lists the buildings independently from the rest of its portfolio, it could be a signal that loft office buildings in downtown Chicago – with open floor plans and high, wood-beam ceilings favored by financial service firms – remain popular, wrote Crain’s. KBS identified River North as a growth market when it purchased 213 W. Institute Place in 2017, according to a company press release announcing the acquisition.“This acquisition is consistent with KBS’ strategy of targeting growth markets, particularly attractive to high value employees, which we believe 213 West Institute Place will allow us to do,” said Ken Robertson, regional president with KBS, in a release at the time of the purchase. “These growth trends also provide value for investors as companies continue to compete for top talent.”KBS initially announced plans to liquidate in August 2020 as a result of the pandemic and civil unrest in Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, where much of its real estate portfolio is located, Crain’s reported. Those plans were put on hold as investor demand for properties softened, but have been set in motion now, after the value of its assets fell by about a third since 2020.KBS Growth & Income REIT is an affiliate of KBS Capital Advisors, which owns the Accenture Tower at 500 W.

It bought the property from the DiFoggio family, which owns DiFoggio Plumbing & Sewer Contractors.Vancouver-based Onni Group was in advanced talks in March to buy the 190,000-square-foot site at 901 North Halsted Street, at the southern tip of Goose Island, Crain’s reported at the time. The deal would be for $50 million and up to 1,000 apartments would be built.Long dominated by industrial plants and warehouses, the 160-acre Goose Island was rezoned to accommodate more retail and office uses as part of the city’s 2017 North Branch Framework plan. Residential development on the island remains off-limits under the new zoning layout — except on the island’s southeast corner, the site of Greyhound’s property.Still, any large residential development would likely require another zoning change. The property is part of an affordable housing “pilot zone” established last November that would require at least 20 percent of units to be rented below market rate.R2 Companies, one of the most active property owners on Goose Island, moved its headquarters in June to a rehabbed office building overlooking the Chicago River near Division Street.Also in June, Onni Group rolled out a proposal for a 356-unit apartment tower at 353 West Grand Avenue in River North.

Winthrop Avenue, Cedar Realty, plans to reduce the number of units in Foswyn Arms, located in Edgewater Beach, from 88 to 62 to include bathrooms in each room, according to the Chicago Tribune.A Department of Housing spokesperson said the city previously put a hold on a renovation permit for the project to ensure the owner was following the ordinance. He said the hold was eventually lifted, but the owner is still going through the permitting process and a renovation permit hasn’t been issued yet.After outcry by the city and housing advocates, the building’s owner came up with a relocation plan for current residents, giving them an option for them to return. But tenants are worried the units will become unaffordable when renovations are complete.Cedar Realty agreed to delay the move-out date until Nov. 1, but the city still wants more time, saying the company created a situation where tenants are “verging on panic and a dread of homelessness.”Citywide, the inventory of affordable housing has been declining for decades. An ordinance was adopted in 2014 to prevent the decline of SROs and require building owners to provide the city with a relocation plan for residents.Cedar Realty has owned Foswyn Arms since 2012.[Chicago Tribune] — Brianna KellyAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",5240 N.

The design would close off Randolph’s unique side access roads to car traffic, creating more pedestrian space. Several community members raised concerns the plan could choke traffic in the busy restaurant and nightlife district.Related Midwest is also proposing a 58-story tower slated to include an Equinox hotel just a few blocks to the east — a project that would be the tallest building yet in the neighborhood.The developers said they are targeting a 2019 groundbreaking at 900 West Randolph, with about a two-year timetable for construction.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",900 West Randolph Street

If the whole country kept building houses at that pace from 2008 until now, it would mean an additional 6.3 million units, researchers found.The Chicago area saw about 3.1 building permits per 1,000 residents each year during the last 15 years of the 20th century, compared to 3.9 permits per 1,000 nationwide. Since 2008, the national average slid to 1.9 permits per 1,000, and the Chicago area dropped to just 0.7.Of all the metro areas studied in the report, Houston is the only market where construction actually sped up after the crash. The nation’s fourth-largest city, known for its relatively lax zoning, has issued 4.9 building permits per 1,000 residents every year for the past decade, compared to 3.6 between 1985 and 2000.A report this spring posted the inventory of single-family homes on the market in Chicago at its lowest level since at least 2007.\xa0[Crain’s] — Alex NitkinAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The latest figure is higher than the 18.6 percent rate in the third quarter of 2020.Firms in Chicago signed leases for 2.2 million square feet of space in the third quarter, the most since the pandemic.“I would characterize it as tenant musical chairs,” said Eric Feinberg, vice chairman and co-head for the Chicago region at Savills. “When you are moving from one building to another, you’re not changing availability that much. It’s not like pre-pandemic where you’re having organic expansion of jobs or industry in Chicago.”Quarterly leasing was led by Kirkland & Ellis’s signing of 600,000 square feet at the Salesforce Tower, relocating from the 500,000 square feet office space at 300 North LaSalle Drive. Kraft Heinze also renewed its 162,000 square feet at Aon Center.Savills’ Feinberg also attributed the high vacancy rate to offices trying to figure out work-from-home arrangements as uncertainty still lingers over the coronavirus.“There hasn’t been complete certainty as to what those policies are going to be. There is definitely uncertainty around what those are and how those [work-from-home policies] are going to affect leasing decisions going forward,” said Feinberg.Overall gross asking rents nevertheless ticked upward, increasing 0.7 percent to $40.70 per square foot this quarter. Asking rents for Class A properties drove up the overall market, with Class A building rents increasing by 1.2 percent to $46.63 per square foot. Tenant demand for amenities and upgraded building facilities at Class A properties remain high while effective rents declined precipitously in Class B buildings.North Michigan Avenue had the lowest vacancy rate of 15.9 percent in the quarter while the Far West Loop and Fulton Market had the highest, at 25.5 percent.

08:15 AM",Michael Reschke is tired of rehashing his past — and what a past it’s been.,"[""Michael Reschke (Photo by Matt Haas)Michael Reschke is tired of rehashing his past — and what a past it’s been.The veteran developer was once chairman of three public companies, including the nation’s largest mall owner, before experiencing a tumultuous period that saw his exit from Prime Group Realty Trust’s office empire following a memorable clash with Steve Roth. Then Reschke came up short with a bid to take back the Prime office holdings after David Lichtenstein’s Lightstone Group made a winning offer.Yet 20 years later, at 66, the Houdini of Chicago real estate is back on top as CEO of the now-separate Prime Group and facing what may be his biggest challenge yet: the $350 million renovation of the 1.2 million-square-foot Helmut Jahn-designed Thompson Center, a gamble on a post-pandemic Loop renaissance amid record office vacancy rates. The only other bidder for the deteriorating state-owned building had proposed demolishing it.Jahn designed a large atrium and open offices to signify transparency in government — a look that also proved the spaceship-shaped building’s downfall. Single-paned glass walls made for poor insulation in both summer and winter, costing taxpayers $17 million annually to operate it. Drainage issues rusted the building’s pillars: Scaffolding frequently engulfed the property as stone cracked and fell.Reschke is undaunted, counting on the state of Illinois’ promise to buy back a third of the building and move the Attorney General’s Office back in. He says he’s already fielding interest from potential tenants who could lease as much as 300,000 square feet, though no pre-leasing has been completed.These days, Reschke shuns the reference to the magician in favor of being compared to Nik Wallenda, who in 2014 set two world records by traversing the Chicago River on a tightrope from the top of the Marina City west tower to the Leo Burnett building and then, blindfolded, walking from one Marina City tower rooftop to the other.“People look at him and say, ‘You’re taking a huge risk, you’re fucking crazy,’” Reschke said in an interview at the Roanoke, his restaurant at the base of his 384-unit Residence Inn at 11 South LaSalle Street. “Well, Wallenda would tell you, ‘I’ve been doing this since I was six months old, and for me, it’s like walking in the park.’”Thompson Center,\xa0 which Reschke intends to keep entirely offices, contrary to previous reports, is just part of his decade-old effort to revive LaSalle Street, the major north-south corridor whose Loop section includes the city’s financial district. He’s trying to convert the “canyon” hemmed in by former financial institutions into a lively tourism destination with apartments and rejuvenated workplaces.Urban experts convened by the city have urged the conversion of offices into housing. The cost may be prohibitive, they acknowledge, and new development across the river in the West Loop — specifically Fulton Market — is a growing threat for landlords seeking tenants for top-tier offices or new apartments.“There is going to be a time and place for people to embrace Mike’s vision of a renaissance, but I wouldn’t want to be the first person to bet on it,” said West Loop and Fulton Market developer Philip Denny.Reschke’s Thompson Center project has sparked recollections of his big appetite for risk and his ability to wriggle out of skirmishes with lenders and competitors. He’s in the midst of closing a deal right now to resolve a $50 million battle with a lender.“I don’t want to delude the significance and importance of what we’re doing today with anything from 20 years ago,” he said. “Right now, I’m interested in the renaissance that’s going to happen with Chicago.”In addition to reviving the Thompson Center, Reschke will raise his wager if he closes on a $191 million loan against nearby connected 37-story and 23-story office buildings along Monroe Street that face LaSalle and Clark streets.He hopes to pay a discount to the loan’s face value, giving him funding to enliven the LaSalle Street portion, where 900,000 square feet was left vacant by the exits of BMO Harris Bank and law firm Chapman & Cutler for the new BMO Tower on Canal Street. The mostly empty building left its owner, a venture of South Korea’s Samsung Life Insurance, and lender Union Bank in jeopardy. Reschke plans to convert part of the Clark Street portion’s upper floors into as many as 500 apartments.The developer also plans to bid for the soon-to-be mostly vacant former Bank of America building next door to the former BMO building if, as many expect, owner AmTrust hands it back to its lender. He’s counting on success with those properties as well as The LaSalle, a 234-room luxury hotel at 208 South LaSalle converted from offices on five floors above his 610-room JW Marriott hotel, a project he touts as having “spurred the revolution of bringing people back to downtown 24-7.”Another venture Reschke leads has also signed an agreement to resolve a $50 million foreclosure attempt by Midland National Life Insurance on other office floors at the building, and he plans to refinance the space in the “very near future.” He’s confident he’ll hold onto it and convert it into 280 apartments, which he said will lease “like popcorn” to residents attracted by the amenities and services associated with the hotels.“For me it’s not a risk, because I do it. I know how to do it,” Reschke said. “The timing couldn’t be better to buy buildings. I’ve been in business over 40 years. I’ve never seen values this low.”Reschke’s willing to give projects some extra time to blossom before calling it quits, just as he did for his son, who signed a contract promising to maintain a B average or better at the University of Colorado in Boulder instead of aiming for the Naval Academy, as his father had hoped. The son turned in a single B-minus as a freshman, but Reschke let him stay another year, after which he transferred to St. Regis University in Denver.Reschke graduated in 1972 from Arlington High School in Chicago’s northwest suburbs, working from the age of 16 as a tile setter for his father’s small business. He majored in accounting at Northern Illinois University and received a law degree from the University of Illinois Law School, shifting to real estate after stints at Arthur Andersen and Winston & Strawn.He’s still focused on details: While touring the 21st floor of 208 South LaSalle, where a crew of workers was putting the finishing touches on the hotel lobby and bar, he marveled at the African eucalyptus wood finishes before griping to a contractor that a door behind a lobby desk wasn’t closing smoothly.“I’ve always been on construction sites,” Reschke said.He’s also got a knack for overcoming poor timing. Reschke started the JW Marriott project just as the Great Recession was crushing financial markets.“What Mike did with the JW Marriott is plant a very high-end flag of over 600 rooms in the heart of the Loop when there were a lot of skeptics,” said Rich Curto, a former partner of Reschke’s at Prime Group before the Steve Roth ordeal. “The JW Marriott was a classic case of people suggesting that maybe that wasn’t a good thing to do, but if you look at it, it was effectively successful even though there was a downturn in the economy.”Shortly after Reschke moved the project forward, two more luxury hotels — the Kimpton Gray and Hyatt Centric — opened on Monroe, just off LaSalle. “They followed me,” he said.He remains dismissive about rivals. “They’re all jealous,” he said. “They don’t understand risk like I do.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",17 million annually to operate it.

12:05 PM","When the late Nancy Hughes’ home in Lake Forest came on the market in August for $15 million, it was yet another sign of how well the city’s luxury market was performing. The home had previously sold for $12 million in 2018, with the new list price representing a 25 percent increase.","[""263 N Mayflower Rd, Lake Forest (Zillow, Getty)When the late Nancy Hughes’ home in Lake Forest came on the market in August for $15 million, it was yet another sign of how well the city’s luxury market was performing. The home had previously sold for $12 million in 2018, with the new list price representing a 25 percent increase.But when the home finally closed last week after months under contract, the final price was $12.9 million — significantly closer to its last sale price than the ask.Chicago’s luxury market continues to perform well when measured by deal volume, but what happened at the Lake Forest home isn’t uncommon. Plenty of the city’s biggest richest home sales included steep cuts from their listing prices, meaning many sellers had to shave millions off their asking price to get a deal done.Rafael Murillo, with RM Luxury Group at Compass, secured a 29 percent decrease from the list price when he repped the buyer of a downtown condo in what he called the “deal of the century.”His client purchased the River North condo at 676 N Kingsbury Street for $1.6 million, after it was listed for $2.25 million and had previously sold in 2017 for $2.1 million, marking a significant loss for the sellers during a sluggish downtown condo market.Murillo said his first step in submitting an offer is a call with the seller’s agent to learn more about the sellers, the previous offers they’ve had on the house, and how quickly they need to move.“You can use this information to your advantage by accommodating their closing needs, but offering less than you would to meet their timeline,” he said. “I have no problem submitting a low offer and encouraging the listing agent to provide a counter offer.”The trend isn’t just seen on some luxury deals, but often the one’s at the very top. This year’s priciest deals, including the $20 million Trump Tower Chicago penthouse sale that was cut from a $30 million list price, have undergone substantial shaves. In the Gold Coast, a 10,000-square-foot Beaux-Arts style mansion sold for $7 million, almost half the $13.5 million asking price when it was listed two years ago.The same trend is happening in the North Shore’s suburbs, where a $16 million listing of a century-old lakefront mansion eventually closed for $12.75 million. In August, a six-bedroom, 11,600-square-foot Lake Forest home, known as “La Vieille Maison” hit the market in March 2021 with an asking price of $10.5 million, before it closed on August 1 for $7.5 million. In September, a 6,000-square-foot home in Lake Forest sold for $5 million after originally being listed in May for $6.8 million.The price cuts don’t mean the luxury market has slowed down, however. Within the city limits, 66 sales closed at $4 million or more last year, according to the Chicago Association of Realtors — that’s the price benchmark the group considers ultra-luxury properties. Through September, there have been 48 such sales in 2022, putting this year only slightly behind last year’s pace by four sales, or a 7 percent dip.Murillo said his approach was specific to the downtown condo market, a point of weakness in Chicago’s otherwise healthy luxury sector. He said notable exceptions to the condo market’s weak pricing include No 9 Walton, One Chicago, St Regis and Tribune Tower.“I find that negotiations work out better when the buyer offers a higher price the second time around but moves less during each counter which gets to the seller’s bottom dollar before you get to your buyer’s top dollar,” Murillo said. “Slow and steady wins the race for negotiations.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",263 N Mayflower Rd

Wells Fargo provided the previous loan, property records indicate.Onni’s apartment building at 1140 North Wells Street opened in April and includes a penthouse unit that rents for $45,000 a month, making it the priciest rental property in Chicago. The 4,200-square-foot apartment spans two floors and comes with a private pool, a hot tub and an outdoor shower.Rents for the remaining units range from $2,000 to $4,000.Onni is working to build the next two phases of its massive Old Town Park project.In December, the firm secured a $125 million construction loan from Wells Fargo for the second phase of its project, a 39-story, 428-unit rental tower. The building was already under construction in December.The approval process for Onni’s planned third tower in the project hit a bump late last year. After neighbors said that Onni had backed out of a pledge to include 20 percent affordable housing in each phase of its development, the city’s Plan Commission deadlocked on a measure to approve the third tower. It is unclear if the project, set to include 456 units in a 41-story building, has been approved.The Old Town Park project is the redevelopment of the former Atrium Village housing complex and will include the rehabbing of an Atrium building that was constructed in the 1970s.A representative for the firm did not immediately return a request for comment.Onni Group, one of LA’s biggest developers, is also building a 41-story apartment tower in River North.

The Washington Street outpost likely will debut first, with a planned opening in the fall, the Tribune reported.Food halls, which are upscale cafeterias featuring well-known food vendors, have been gobbling up thousands of square feet in Downtown and beyond. Their popularity could be boosting property values.In 2015, Blue Star Properties and the Wolcott Group paid $28 million for the National building in the Loop, and the partners overhauled the historic building and added Revival, the concept that started the food hall craze in Chicago. Late last year, the property sold for $202 million.McCaffery Interests signed Pittsburgh-based Galley Group to a 13,000-square-foot lease for a food hall in its Fulton Market redevelopment. That food hall will be blocks away from one the company behind Time Out Magazine plans to open at 916 West Fulton Market.Also in Fulton Market, Politan Row Chicago is working to open its popular food hall concept in McDonald’s headquarters.In the Loop, The John Buck Company is partnering with DMK Restaurants on a 30,000-square-foot food hall at 333 South Wabash Avenue.

In moving downtown it would join a growing list of suburban companies uprooting from the suburbs for the city or opening an outpost in the city to attract young talent.After landing a $97.2 million construction loan, Rosemont-based White Oak and Chicago-based CA Office in 2016 began building the 438,000-square foot tower on spec, hoping to cash in on the robust downtown office market. But the building, one of two large office projects to come online this year, has sat empty since it opened.The developers hired Newmark Knight Frank earlier this year to lease up the building.White Oak, meanwhile, is turning its attention to residential projects in the West Loop, where it plans to build a 273-unit apartment tower at 205 South Peoria Street and a 205-unit building at 111 South Peoria.Ferrara signed a 10-year lease at 1 Tower Lane in Oakbrook Terrace in 2012 after it was bought by private equity firm Catterton Partners, which merged it with another confectionary company in its portfolio, Farley’s & Sathers Candy Company. A venture of Italian confectionary giant Ferrero Group bought Ferrara last year, then acquired Nestle’s U.S. candy business and integrated it under the Ferrara banner.The future of the Oakbrook Terrace office space was unclear.

The financing, obtained through Cook County records, has not been previously reported.Multi-Employer Property Trust Fund was the seller of the development at 333 E. Ontario Street. When it listed the property in late January, MEPT was eyeing $200 million, about $189,000 a unit. The firm paid $126 million for McClurg Court in 2006. BentallGreenOak, which oversees the building as an MEPT adviser, poured $35 million into improvements.Built 50 years ago, the two-tower McClurg Court includes a fitness center, pool, tennis courts and outdoor patios. The complex has become the preferred residence of employees and graduate students of nearby Northwestern Memorial Hospital and Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine.Maryland-based MEPT listed the property for sale in 2019, promoting it as an “affordable, amenity-rich living experience in a neighborhood dominated by newer luxury high-rise towers,” according to market material at the time.But the property didn’t sell and BentallGreenOak negotiated a new 99-year ground lease on the 25 percent of the land MEPT didn’t own — the remaining portion belongs to descendants of bookseller Andrew C.

He then used his grandson’s company, 9C LLC to purchase $734,428 of the owed taxes for Mako Properties Inc. for a price tag of $5,650. This covered taxes owed on five of the seven properties the 77-year-old owns through his companies.His method of avoiding tax payments and then using another one of his companies to buy out the taxes has been used on seven properties. They are: 15825 and 15827 Dixie Highway, Harvey;1415 E. 142nd St., Dolton; 1869 Sibley Blvd., Calumet City; 13825 Park Ave., Dolton; 420 E. 142nd St., Dolton; 606 E. 142nd St., Dolton.Nitchoff used another one of his companies, B. Hartman Group, to pay off more taxes on two of the properties. He paid just $20,630 to buy the $126,583 owed. Unfortunately for him, his tactics violate state law and Nitchoff apparently knows it.“We thought about it — because the company is under different companies, different owners, it’s not the owner of deed,” he told the Sun-Times. “In a way, it could be legal. But I just didn’t want to create problems for the boys and me.”Records show that even after purchasing the $861,000 in taxes that they have failed to pay property taxes on all of the seven properties which totals to $1.68 million.The Nitchoff family has won tens of millions of dollars in public contracts to soundproof homes near O’Hare and Midway airports, and to rehab porches and roofs for low-income homeowners across the city.Nitchoff and his two sons, Alex nitchoff and Constantino Nitchoff, were named in a federal search warrant related to Ald.

A session will be held next month to decide what to do with the site.Whatever the decision, Evanston-based Savoy Consulting Group has been hired to draw up five conceptual ideas and to recruit developers. One idea is already gaining steam among community members – affordable housing.“Based on my discussions, that site is a very desirable location for an affordable housing developer,” Village President Mark Senak told the Herald. “It is close to schools. It has access to transportation. There’s three grocery stores within walking distance.”Religious leaders, community advocates and parents of people with disabilities all favor the idea of affordable housing. Julie Evans, a Glen Ellyn resident whose son has Down syndrome, has been an advocate for more affordable housing in the village, which she says would allow people with disabilities to remain in the community as they gain independence.“Housing that is safe, pedestrian-friendly, accessible to public transportation seven days a week and includes on-site, individually designed supportive services is critical to their success,” Evans said in a message to the village board, according to the Herald.Advocates say the redevelopment of the former Larkin Center in Elgin could serve as a template for the project.Board members, including Senak, are open to considering alternatives. He said that ideally the hotel buildings on the property would be demolished. The cost of doing so is unclear, but Assistant Village Manager Emily Rodman estimated $500,000, according to the Herald.[Daily Herald] – Harrison ConneryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

It was at least the sixth time Realty Income has bought a store branded by the upscale grocer since 2017.In suburban Glenview, Arizona’s Nottinghill Gate Tucson paid Chicago’s Inland Real Estate $18 million for a 64,000-square-foot Jewel-Osco grocery at 1340 Patriot Boulevard.The deals underscore the relative safety of food stores compared with the challenge of trying to fill storefronts on high-end urban shopping strips such as Chicago’s Magnificent Mile and State Street. It isn’t just Illinois: Two South Florida sales for a combined $57 million this month helped ignite interest in retail from investors seeking a steady cash flow, The Real Deal reported.Neither the buyers nor the sellers on the Chicago sales responded to requests for comment. The South Loop deal provided a margin of almost 30 percent above Melohn’s 2014 purchase price, and Jewel sold for 40 percent more than its 2017 price, public record show.The sales came as about a quarter of the Mag Mile’s retail space stands empty and landlords and city leaders mull how to turn around the pandemic-battered strip.This spring, Brixmor bought a suburban Whole Foods for $26 million, or $257 a square foot.

Supply has fallen from a healthy level of four to six months to less than one month, according to the Chicago Daily Herald.“There are so few homes on the market that pretty much every seller of a clean, updated home can now expect multiple offers and will probably get as much as $20,000 over asking price,” Jim Regan, an agent for Remax Suburban in Mount Prospect, told the Herald.At the heart of the shortage is a mismatch between supply and demand. Most older buyers are looking for ranch homes and houses with first-floor master suites, while developers are building traditional two-story homes because they’re cheaper to make, said Lynn Klein, broker/owner of Century 21 New Heritage with offices in Hampshire, West Dundee, Marengo and Huntley.Jim Barcelona, vice president of brokerage services for @properties, said sellers should enter the market right now, even if they don’t want to move until summer.“If you don’t want to close until after school is out, you have the leverage to say that to your buyer,” he told the Herald.Buyers need to have a strong pre-approval letter from their lender and should make an immediate offer on any home they like, Barcelona said. They should also have a good understanding of the average market time and the ratio of list price to sale price.“Be prepared to be disappointed,” he said. “Don’t lowball.”Buyers can also sweeten their offers by allowing the seller to rent the home back for a time, or even let them stay rent free.\n“World events will eventually change things — like the stock market, interest rates or the Russia-Ukraine conflict,” he said. “But it could take three months or three years.

It is one of the largest apartment buildings to be put up for sale since the pandemic started. A deal could signal renewed optimism in Chicago’s commercial real estate market.So far, investors have backed away from buying or selling properties in Chicago’s downtown core because of uncertainty around pricing and demand for space.Halsted Flats was constructed in 2014 and is one of the few new luxury apartments in the area. It first hit the market in October 2018 when Chicago’s rental market was red hot and developers were converting their condos to rentals. The developers never found a buyer.Halsted Flats is about 91 percent occupied. Its average unit rental price was $2.93 per square foot in the third quarter, according to CoStar.The developers financed the project with a $58.5 million construction loan and then refinanced it with a $72.5 million loan in 2015. The developers told the city in 2012 it would cost $73.4 million to build.JDL is one of Chicago’s most active residential developers. Its other projects include One Chicago in River North.

Lightfoot has estimated recreational marijuana will eventually bring in $10 million in tax revenues a year for Chicago, and that projection was in line with her budgeted figures. Lightfoot needs to close a $838 million budget gap.Eleven medical marijuana dispensaries already operate in Chicago, and recreational sales are slated to begin on Jan. 1, though it’s unclear how many stores will ultimately open.Lightfoot had pushed hard for a marijuana exclusionary zone spanning much of the downtown, but has received significant pushback from aldermen. Ald. Brendan Reilly (42nd), who spoke out against Lightfoot’s proposal, estimated that marijuana tax revenue could bring in $25 million a year if it were permitted in Lightfoot’s so-called exclusionary zone.Marijuana-related revenue wasn’t included in a $6.2 billion budget proposed earlier this month by Cook County board president Toni Preckwinkle or in Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s $40 billion budget from four months ago.Marijuana products containing less than 35 percent THC will also be taxed at a 10 percent rate on the state level and those with more THC will be taxed at a 25 percent rate. Cannabis-infused products will be taxed at a 20 percent rate.The state law’s Democratic sponsors have estimated recreational marijuana sales will create only $56 million in new taxes for the first year of sales, the Associated Press reported.A study commissioned earlier this year by those sponsors determined the state’s recreational marijuana market could generate between $440 million to $676 million in annual tax revenue. Another study estimates the state’s legal marijuana industry could employ 65,000 people by 2025.[Sun-Times] —\xa0Brianna KellyAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

There are only two four-bedroom condos on the market in Lakeview today, according to Redfin, and they top out at $1.6 million.“Condos of that size are very desirable,” said Federici, whose partners on the project are Jefferson Offutt and William Fisher — both former KRAIN agents. Fisher, who also sells for Compass, will co-list the units with Federici.Federici is funding the project with a $4.8 million construction loan from Renovo Financial, which records show closed last week. He bought the property — currently a red-brick house — in 2016 for $1.65 million, and his permit application is moving through the city now.KRAIN closed in December when Federici took 11 of his top agents with him to Compass, he said. His new company has no problem with his work on the side.“They encourage us to procure business,” Federici said. “You just need to divulge your ownership interests legally, which we’re always up-front about.”This is not Federici’s first ground-up project. He and his partners also built 10 units at 1018 North Larrabee Street in Old Town, when KRAIN still existed.

The panel noted it cannot compel Ricketts to testify and referred the case to the state attorney — who can, the Tribune reported.State Attorney Kim Foxx’s spokeswoman said the office was “reviewing the matter at this time to determine the appropriate next steps.”The bargain property assessment, which reduced a $2 million property valuation to $828,000, was based on a structure that once stood on the Wilmette property — an older, smaller house that Ricketts demolished in in 2007. In its place, he built a contemporary designer home, almost double the original home’s size, at 5,000 square feet, according to the Tribune.Ricketts’ attorney said that Ricketts’s missteps were “a series of good faith miscommunications” with no attempt to deceive. Ricketts has made some restitutional steps, backpaying three years of taxes, the maximum under state law, totaling at least $60,000.Chicago property assessments are on the rise in general, with new county assessor Fritz Kaegi looking to overhaul the “old fuzzy system.” [Chicago Tribune] — Sarah PaynterAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",510 Laurel Avenue

It has more than two years remaining on its lease for the four-story building at 955 American Lane. CBRE is marketing the entire property.It is the largest sublease on the suburban office market, eclipsing the 165,000-square-foot listing from Capital One in nearby Rolling Meadows, according to the report.The suburban market had over 3.6 million square feet of space available for sublease, Crain’s noted, citing a late January report from JLL. In the Chicago central business district\xa0some 5.4 million square feet was vacant in the fourth quarter, the most since the Great Recession, according to MB Real Estate.Numerous firms have sought to shed office space, exit leases or pull back on future plans, citing the effects of Covid-19 on the workforce. Experian, however, was vague about its reason, saying only that it was “part of our regular real estate assessment,” the publication noted. The company added that it was committed to remaining in Schaumburg.By the third quarter of 2020, suburban office vacancy had jumped to 25 percent,\xa0the highest in a decade.And in November, the American Board of Radiology said it would sublease its 71,000-square-foot office in Oak Brook, months after signing a long-term lease.

12:03 PM",Mayor Rahm Emanuel wants to resurrect the city’s housing department in an effort to coordinate his administration’s recent efforts aimed at affordable housing.,"[""Mayor Rahm Emanuel (Credit: Getty Images and David Wilson via Flickr)Mayor Rahm Emanuel wants to resurrect the city’s housing department in an effort to coordinate his administration’s recent efforts aimed at affordable housing.The mayor on Tuesday proposed creating the Chicago Department of Housing to oversee the implementation of the next “Five-Year Housing Plan” and coordinate the city’s myriad affordable housing initiatives. Those include the Building Neighborhood and Affordable Homes pilot program he announced Monday.That program adds to an effort launched late last year to sell developers lots across the city for $1 each, in exchange for building single-family homes and two-flats on them.Developers can buy eight to 20 city-owned lots, each with a maximum appraised value of $125,000. The developers would then sell the homes to qualified buyers with incomes up to 140 percent of area median income, or $110,600 for a family of four, the Chicago Tribune reported at the time.The homes would be priced at approximately $150,000 to $300,000. The city agreed to reduce permit fees to make the program more appealing to developers, and to try to attract more small and minority developers.On Monday, the mayor proposed the new program to provide $40,000 to $60,000 to qualifying applicants toward the purchase of homes built through the $1 lot program, and who agree to live in them for 10 years. That effort is to be funded with $5 million from a fund that developers pay into instead of including affordable housing units in their projects.“Each affordable housing project requires a unique stack of incentives, including land, financing, credits and affordability requirements to get across the finish line,” according to a mayor’s press release. “The housing department will be a partner to the development and advocacy community to bring new solutions to the city’s new challenges.”Last week, Emanuel announced an effort to curb gentrification in areas of the city that have high demand for housing. The new Chicago Opportunity Investment Fund would provide low-cost financing to developers who buy multifamily buildings, if they agree to guarantee that 20 percent of the units remain affordable for 15 years.The city committed another $5 million to that fund, and officials said they would look for private partners to contribute another $25 million.The mayor has been issuing a flurry of press releases to address the city’s housing issue. On Friday, he pitched a plan to expand the city’s rules regarding transit-oriented developments to include parcels along major CTA bus lines. While Emanuel touted that proposal as another way to encourage affordable housing, developers cheered it as a way to eliminate the costly and sometimes unnecessary expense of building an equal number of parking spaces to housing units.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

04:00 PM","Code Real Estate Partners’ planned 330,000-square-foot mixed-use development is the latest proposal for redeveloping the city’s century-old Central Manufacturing District in McKinley Park.","[""Jared Remington and 2159 W Pershing Road (Credit: LinkedIn and Google Maps)Code Real Estate Partners’ planned 330,000-square-foot mixed-use development is the latest proposal for redeveloping the city’s century-old Central Manufacturing District in McKinley Park.The New York-based developer is asking the city to rezone two historic buildings in the district to make way for as many as 160 apartments and 120,000 square feet of commercial space.If approved, the project would further the redevelopment of what is a vast, mostly vacant industrial complex in what developers see as an up-and-coming neighborhood. Earlier this year, McKinley Park was named the hottest affordable neighborhood in the United States by Redfin.“We were looking for historic rehab opportunities,” Code managing partner Jared Remington said of his firm’s first project in Chicago. “We love the location by the park. We feel this is the next neighborhood to really get hot.”Code’s plans call for redeveloping the 180,000-square-foot structure at 2159 West Pershing Road into 130 apartments, many of which would be affordable and income-restricted.At 2139 West Pershing, Code plans about 120,000 square feet of commercial space, which could accommodate a co-working office or even light manufacturing uses, Remington said. The building also would house 30 market-rate apartments. Plans call for 145 parking spaces and green roof features, according to the rezoning request.Code, which specializes in affordable and historic redevelopments, will seek to keep as many of the buildings’ original features as possible, including windows, interior beams and other features, Remington said.“There’s good bones,” he said of the structures. “We’re going to keep the historic character.”The $63 million project primarily would be financed through public funding mechanisms, including the use of historic tax credits, new market tax credits and low income housing tax credits, Remington said.Code is hoping to begin work by the end of the year.The project would be the latest in the ongoing redevelopment of the Central Manufacturing District.Aberdeen Development already is working to redevelop the buildings at 2055 and 2133 West Pershing Road into office space, according to Crain’s. The city also is seeking proposals for the redevelopment of 570,000 square feet of space at 1769 and 1869 West Pershing.The redevelopment of the industrial site was kick-started in the mid 2000s, when the Habitat Company redeveloped a former warehouse at 2323 West Pershing into 163 condos.Just east of the Central Manufacturing District, industrial developer Logistics Property Company is planning a 137,000-square-foot “last mile” shipping warehouse.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2159 W Pershing Road

12:51 PM","The Chicago Bears’ move to the suburbs is stirring passions on both sides of the city limits, with hometown fans bemoaning the loss to the city and real estate brokers in the team’s potential new home of Arlington Heights celebrating the impact it would have on development.","[""The Arlington International Racecourse (Getty)The Chicago Bears’ move to the suburbs is stirring passions on both sides of the city limits, with hometown fans bemoaning the loss to the city and real estate brokers in the team’s potential new home of Arlington Heights celebrating the impact it would have on development.The Bears agreed to buy the Arlington International Racecourse property about 30 miles northwest of the city’s downtown. While the deal hasn’t yet been finalized, the team said it is still exploring its potential. The 326-acre property is situated off a major highway, has its own stop on the Metra commuter rail, and is surrounded by industrial space where a range of commercial and residential projects could be developed around a new stadium.“I think the real domino effect is going to be the spurring of entertainment districts — lots of bars, restaurants. It’s going to attract a lot of nightlife and opportunity,’’ said Jason Wurtz, executive vice president at commercial real estate firm NAI Hiffman. “There aren’t just going to be football games there. People are going to do sports, music, soccer in the stadium.”About 2 million square feet of commercial property is located within a one-mile radius of the Arlington International Racecourse, with nearly 18 percent of the property vacant, according to CoStar. Expanding the radius to two miles, commercial property space jumps to 9.5 million square feet, with about 13 percent of the space being vacant.“I would assume that whoever buys this, they’re going to spin off a lot of parcels to create more retail or some type of contained urban center that’s going to have retail, restaurants, maybe even multifamily,” Wurtz said.For some Bears fans, the move from Soldier Field and the vibrant downtown area after more than 50 years would be a betrayal at a time when the city is struggling to overcome the effects of the pandemic, which has particularly hurt the lodging, retail and entertainment industries. Even if Chicago is able to replace the revenue lost from the Bears with new uses for the old stadium, the psychological impact will take some time to get over.“The Bears are like those girls I went to college with who said they were from Chicago but really lived 30 miles away in the suburbs,” said Twitter user Molly Beck, mocking the team’s decision to exit the city-owned stadium they have played in since 1971.Revenue for Soldier Field plummeted to $14.8 million last year due to the pandemic. An income of $6.5 million annually in lease payments to the city would stop, which is a blow to Mayor Lori Lightfoot who is trying to close a $733 million budget deficit.The city would also lose the money spent by fans during home games and would have to find a way to replace those streams of revenue.“They’ll lose their share of ticket tax, which is not an insignificant amount of money,” said Marc Gani, president of Sportscorp. “They’ll lose some hotel and tourist money that comes in. It’s not ideal, but it shouldn’t be such a meaningful drop.”He added: “They’ll see how they can find other ways to make up for it by putting other events in Soldier Field and in the area around it.”The whole racecourse site is about six times bigger than SoFi stadium, the home of the Los Angeles Rams, which opened in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood last year.For Arlington Heights, ample parking space, more luxury boxes and potential to build a domed stadium could bring winter sports to the area — main factors that will bring in more foot traffic to the suburban city, about a 45-minute drive from Chicago.“It’s going to bring in tax dollars to the community which would theoretically go back into infrastructure and supporting communities,” said Wurtz.With the rise of residential and commercial properties forecast to go hand in hand, Class A apartment developments would also be likely.“They [The Bears] are going to draw in tons of volume. With hotels will come the residential side of things, Airbnb, condo-style living, and apartment-style living,” said Nick Blackshaw, principal agent of the Blackshaw Messel Group.“This won’t necessarily have an impact on our immediate plans, but as it goes forward and as it becomes more certain, it will certainly encourage us to find more additional sites, said Chris Coleman, vice president of development from Wingspan Development Group whose company has been based in the northwest suburbs of Chicago for more than 40 years.With a new Bears stadium west of the city, home prices would also rise in the south and east, where the median price for a three- or four-bedroom house is about $400,000, said Michael Flinchbaugh, broker associate at the Lord Companies.For comparison, since it was first rumored that SoFi stadium would rise in Inglewood, median home prices jumped about 83 percent from $299,900 in 2014 to nearly $550,000 in February 2019.For Bears fans living near Soldier Field, the Bears’ departure would be a special kind of heartbreak, and damage Chicago’s reputation as a great sports town, and a place where people and businesses are coming, rather than leaving.“This will be two for two examples recently in the Lakefront area where projects have not gone forward or tamed,” said Ganim referring to losing the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art to Los Angeles after a plan to build in Chicago was abandoned in 2016 because of opposition to a proposed lakefront location.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Schaefer had bought that four-story, 35,000-square-foot building for $1.3 million in 2010.Schaefer had remained a tenant of the Madison building as Feil became its landlord for several years, and then downsized with its move into the McCaffrey building. Other tenants have made similar moves to shrink their real estate footprints while moving into Fulton Market spaces considered higher quality to Chicago’s older office buildings in the Loop and West Loop.Another marketing firm made a similar deal this year to Schaefer’s 2018 sale to Feil. Chicago-based AgencyEA cashed in with a sale of the 41,000 square foot River North property at 311 West Walton Street for $14.4 million to a Spanish investor, and leased back the office building to remain its tenant. The deal more than tripled the $4.6 million AgencyEA paid for the building in 2014.Back in Fulton Market, Schaefer will join Coca-Cola, Bissell, Datassential and ServiceNow as a tenant in the McCaffery-managed property. Craig Coupe of JLL brokered the deal for Schafer to move into the seven-story building, which is branded as Twelve01West.Coupe told the outlet that Twelve01West, which was completed in 2019, has a penthouse-level wellness center, indoor and outdoor rooftop space and 20,000 total square feet of outdoor hangouts.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",176 North Racine Avenue

And Lollapalooza will once again rock out in Grant Park.But despite the note of hope, the latest numbers also sound an alarm: return to normal won’t happen anytime soon.The city’s hard-hit office market is proof of that. About 25 percent of office workers had returned to their desks in June, according to the Loop Alliance, which drew data from security firm Kastle Systems and its own tally of 18 counters along State Street.Since the coronavirus hit, the Chicago office market has seen tenants exit leases, cut space or cancel planned deals. Central Loop office availability hit a record high of 25.3 percent in the second quarter, according to Colliers. Citywide, office vacancy rose to 17 percent. Some companies began telling workers to return to the office after the July 4 weekend, and others are expected to do so after Labor Day.Loop Alliance CEO Michael Edwards said he believes by the end of summer, about 50 percent of office workers in the Loop will have returned.According to Colliers, “although there is some optimism in the market with a slight uptick in activity compared to last quarter, a return to market ‘health’ is a long way off.”Chicago’s post-pandemic office struggles are similar to other major cities, such as Los Angeles, New York City and San Francisco, according to Kastle Systems.And while more people are moving through the Loop, the 1 million clicks recently registered along State Street is 58 percent below its pre-pandemic volume.The Loop Alliance also reported that bus ridership had ticked up to 45 percent of its usual volume, OpenTable reservations in the city have approached 80 percent of pre-pandemic levels and major Loop hotels have reported a rise in bookings, especially during the July 4 weekend. Rates are also “starting to creep up,” Edwards said.In addition to the auto show that opened today at McCormick Place, the convention center has 119 bookings through the rest of the year. While that’s considered seasonally sluggish, the massive space — along with many others — is still trying to rebound from the pandemic.“Conventions are lagging,” the city’s chief marketing officer, Michael Fassnacht, told the Chicago Sun-Times this week. “But after September, we have strong bookings. And 2022 looks very, very promising.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",18 counters along State Street

Lakeview, according to the New York Post. It was completed in 1917 and was originally one residence. Currently the property is split into two homes, each up for sale.Wendy Berg of Baird & Warner is the listing agent for the properties.The home was built as part of a group of four Georgian-style homes, according to Chicago’s Historic Preservation Society. They were built for a group of friends including Ryerson.Ryerson was an American who survived the sinking of RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912, according to the Post. She and her three children, Suzette, Emily and John made it to safety, but her husband, Arthur, died in the accident.“Unit one is a lot more historic. We have a lot of original molding, original staircase, original stairs,” Leigh-Anne Kazma, an investor behind the Adler on the Park Showcase House for Charity, told WGN9.The four-story building is now divided into two condos, one on the first two floors, and the other on the third and fourth floors.The 6,500-square-foot lower unit is listed at $7.65 million. The five bedroom, four bathroom home includes a grand foyer with a marble checkered floor and restored columns as well as a three-car garage, two mudrooms, and a large family room.The 5.200-square-foot upper unit is listed at $5.65 million. It includes four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a heated 2.5 car garage and an 800-square-foot terrace.The four row homes are connected and overlook Lincoln Park, and have a landmark designation. Six homes were originally planned for the site, but the death of one of the architects as well as the U.S. involvement in World War I prevented the construction of the final two homes. While the homes are in Chicago’s elite Lincoln Park neighborhood, the site was considered unfashionable at the time, away from the Gold Coast, then the center of wealth and society, according to the Historic Preservation Society.[New York Post] — Miranda DavisAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The 280-key hotel occupies 10 floors of the 47-story tower.The hotel takes up floors six through 15 of the 523 foot-tall tower. The rest of the building comprises 289 luxury rental apartments and 25,000 square feet of retail space. Construction on the property began in early 2020.Chicago’s bKL Architecture designed the tower, while Dutch design firm Concrete handled the hotel’s interiors. Wanxiang America Real Estate Group, a Chicago-based real estate investment arm of Chinese auto parts manufacturer Wanxiang Group, is an equity investor in the project.citizenM bills itself as an “affordable luxury” hotel company, offering 150-square-foot rooms with modern design and app-controlled utilities. Rooms at the Chicago location start at $249 a night.The brand has locations in major cities in Europe, Asia and the United States, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and one in Miami’s Brickell neighborhood with two more in the pipeline for the city. The group paid $9 million for the hotel portion of a mixed-use tower at 1212 Lincoln in 2020.

Chinese company Wanda Group had been on board to operate the hotel before it sold its 90 percent stake in the development to Magellan and partners Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan.Magellan announced the new name in late 2020, after securing St. Regis Hotels & Resorts as the new hotel operator.Condos in the tower, which range in price from $1 million to $18.5 million, have been selling at a relatively slow pace. Magellan hasn’t said how many condos in the building have been sold, but Crain’s estimated that 163 units — out of the building’s 353 — have been closed and another 18 are listed as “contract pending.”Back in September, Magellan Development CEO David Carlins paid $6.5 million for a 68th floor unit in the tower.

Locals worry the project will spoil the village’s charm.Christine Bending, whose home sits on more than an acre of land, would get about $1 million from Transwestern, says she isn’t going anywhere – especially after finally agreeing to a developer’s offer to buy her former house of 42 years on Bryn Mawr Ave. near Wood Dale. She sold the four-bedroom for $775,000 and moved into a three-bedroom in Medinah.“It was everything that I wanted, and to have it taken away again?” she told the outlet. “God, I just — I don’t get it.”One resident started an online petition to save the residents’ homes. It has more than 2,300 signatures as of Tuesday.Part of Transwestern’s plans would involve annexing the area into the nearby village of Itasca, where Transwestern is scheduled to present its plans to the community development committee on June 28.Itasca Mayor Jeff Pruyn issued a letter in response to the plans, saying no official decision had been made by the village.“While there have been several discussions with staff, village officials, and the developer, Transwestern opted to first share its plans with Medinah area residents before presenting its concept plan to the Itasca Village Board,” he sold the outlet.[DH] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",42 years on Bryn Mawr Ave

That values it at more than $1 billion.It was among the largest transactions for an office building in Chicago, with Willis Tower as the only Chicago skyscraper with a higher valuation, at $1.3 billion when it was sold to Blackstone in 2015.Before the sale, which closed in March, the tower was a $1.6 million loss for Howard Hughes in 2021, according to its first-quarter earnings call.Howard Hughes CEO David O’Reilly said in a release that the tower was one of the last non-core assets the company had in its portfolio. The sale brought in $169 million — the company’s initial investment in the property was $13 million, according to Bisnow.The 1.5 million-square-foot tower opened in 2020. It’s more than 82 percent leased to long-term tenants, according to Crain’s. Its anchor tenant is Bank of America, which leases more than 500,000 square feet and it has a 45-foot lobby, dining options and a secondary air-filtration system that was added after the pandemic. CBRE will oversee leasing and management of the property.The sale comes at a precarious time for Chicago’s office market, a sector still slow to recover from the pandemic and a shift to remote work. It underscores demand for office properties with views and amenities, even as the pandemic turns longtime work practices topsy-turvy.

Patton’s 548 Capital won city Plan Commission approval to move forward on the $22 million project. The firm will redevelop a printing press that was used for the first nationally syndicated African American-owned newspaper founded by Malcolm X.Perhaps more unique is how the development is being financed: $5 million of the project’s funding comes from a deal tied to Sterling Bay’s tower at 160 North Morgan Street.Commercial real estate development group Alter is acting as project manager.Under changes the city made to its Affordable Requirements Ordinance in April 2021, housing developments in most Chicago neighborhoods must be 20% affordable. Under the ordinance, developers may pay to opt out of the requirements. While that money would usually go toward the city’s housing fund, Sterling Bay, 548 Capital and the city worked out a deal for that money to fund the Solar Lofts project, according to Patton, who said the agreement was among the first of its kind for the city.Patton said the 80,000-square-foot, mid-rise project will “be kind of planting a flag in terms of sustainability and inclusivity particularly in a neighborhood which is seeing a lot of economic pressures.” More than half of the units are affordable housing.Gregory Williams of Gregory Ramon Design Studio, the project’s architect, said the development is “creating housing in an area that definitely needs it” and making use of a building that has long been vacant.Patton has previously led projects city officials have viewed favorably and was picked for a $38 million industrial complex project in North Lawndale that is part of the city’s Invest South/West initiative.

It’s scheduled to open in late 2022.“We’re not here to say that we don’t want to have it here,” said Howard Ray Jr., a West Humboldt Park resident who organized the group. “We are here to say we want to be partners, and we want certain benefits. And if you can’t have those benefits, you don’t need it here.”Reaching a deal could be an uphill climb because the Seattle-based company has been reluctant to agree to such terms. It pressured Seattle officials to repeal a head tax on large employers, which would have been used to fund the city’s homeless services, said Ben Bach, legal director at PowerSwitch Action.Amazon opened at least 10 distribution centers in Chicago this year, most recently in suburban Matteson and Markham, and is building warehouses in Gage Park and Huntley. It hired 15,000 employees in Illinois last year and said in September that it will take on 6,000 workers for fulfillment centers in the suburbs south of Chicago as it expands its distribution network in the area.Amazon couldn’t be reached for comment, the Tribune reported.Alderman Emma Mitts of the 37th ward didn’t comment on whether she would support the push for benefits.“We are focused on expanding our major commercial business corridors, as well as building proactive public-private relationships within the 37th Ward,” Mitts said. “Amazon is making a major stake in Chicago, and I believe their entrance into the West Side of Chicago is a good thing.”[Chicago Tribune] — Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1260 North Kostner Avenue

It will have 100 exterior loading docks and parking stalls for 210 truck trailers, as well as parking for 380 regular vehicles.Industrial investor Faropoint bought three warehouse properties in Elk Grove Village, Des Plaines and Addison last month. The purchases, whose prices weren’t disclosed, help the company with its year-end goal to inject $200 million into the Chicago area.The biggest Chicago-area industrial property sale of 2022 came in April, when a subsidiary of Blackstone, New York-based Link Logistics Real Estate, paid almost $150 million for 12 industrial and office buildings in Waukegan and Zion.The 13 properties TradeLane purchased have 18 tenants, all of which have leases that expire in the next four years.

Goodman (CEO, Mark Goodman & Associates) and renders of residential and life sciences buildings in Fulton Market (Chicago Plan Commission, mgachicago.com, trammellcrow.com)A residential and life sciences building project, the two most in-demand projects in Fulton Market, are a step closer to coming to the area.The Chicago Plan Commission approved a 33-story residential building and a 26-story office building proposed by Trammell Crow Chicago Development at 315 North May Street and 1112 West Carroll Avenue on Thursday. The residential building, rising 370 feet tall, will have 377 units, ground-floor commercial and retail space.Trammell Crow Chicago Development will provide 76 affordable housing units on site, following the city’s affordable requirements ordinance to make 20 percent of the new residential developments affordable.The $550 million project started out as two office towers, but the developer converted the building on 1112 West Carroll Avenue to residential after the Plan Commission revised to allow residential developments north of Lake Street in January this year.Renderings of 400 N. Elizabeth Street (Chicago Plan Commission)The Plan Commission also gave the greenlight for a 16-story life sciences building at 400 North Elizabeth Street in Fulton Market. Mark Goodman & Associates proposed to rezone the site to a business planned development from a commercial and manufacturing district. The $150 million project will include about 492,000 square feet of office space and is expected to create life sciences jobs.Both proposals need the City Council’s final approval before starting construction.Tech companies have been leading office migrations to the area, and a new market of biotechnology is set to emerge. Sterling Bay broke ground for island eight-story building that will house medical research facilities in Lincoln Yards this week. That building, dubbed Ally, is part of Sterling Bay’s plan to create a “scientific innovation” district.Office buildings have been battered by the pandemic as vacancy rates climbed to 17.9 percent in the third quarter, according to JLL. While JLL said the rate is driven by sublease space that’s becoming vacant, Fulton Market is an exception. About 785,000 square feet of space has been completed there in the past year, about 30 percent of which is new construction.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",315 North May Street

Robinson, which recently signed a 15-year lease at the building.Sterling Bay tapped Cushman & Wakefield to list the site in early March, just before the coronavirus outbreak, with a projected price of $120 million, according to reports at the time.Sterling Bay broke ground on the Webster Avenue building before it revealed its plans for Lincoln Yards. The Chicago-based development group paid $21.3 million in 2015 to buy the 4-acre site. It secured an $82.5 million construction loan for the project in 2016, according to Crain’s.The Webster Avenue sale is the second high profile sale for Sterling Bay in recent weeks. The company also has an agreement to sell its Fulton Market office building that houses the McDonald’s headquarters for about $430 million. The buyer is a family office in Pittsburgh.Sterling Bay received approval from the city in March 2019 to build the $6 billion mixed-use Lincoln Yards. Plans for the megaproject call for 14.5 million square feet of office, retail and residential space on former industrial land along the North Branch of the Chicago River.Chicago’s office market has languished since the onset of the pandemic as many office workers continue to operate from home. Available office sublease space in the city reached a record 4.6 million square feet in the third quarter, according to MB Real Estate.

The firm isn’t beginning a massive out-of-state expansion, though. Rather, it’s just following some of its agents and clients.Some of its top-producing agents have secondary business in Florida, where towns along the Gulf of Mexico have long drawn retirees and second homeowners from Chicago and the Midwest, while the Sunshine State’s Atlantic Coast has captured more relocations and second home purchases by East Coast transplants.Some Baird & Warner agents work in Florida as well as Chicago, and some of its clients prefer to work with those agents when looking for homes outside of Chicagoland. Before the new office opened, those agents had to affiliate with other firms that have a Florida presence to work down south.The firm has about 20 agents with Illinois real estate licenses also working out of their Naples office. Those agents primarily represent buyers and sellers in Chicago’s Lincoln Park neighborhood, and suburban Highland Park, Cary and Algonquin.Baird & Warner is the second-largest brokerage in the Chicago area with $7.7 billion in home sales volume in 2021, according to data from RealTrends data cited by the outlet.Steve Baird, the fifth-generation CEO, said the firm opened the new office as “a response to customer loyalty,” as many of their Chicago clients who also buy homes in Florida have asked their Baird & Warner agents for assistance.While the agents were able to help their clients through other brokerages, Baird said the firm wanted let them do that work under his namesake brokerage’s brand.Christie’s International Real Estate this year also leaned into the Chicago area’s Naples connection, as the brokerage and its Chicago-based parent @properties struck a deal to rebrand the 700-agent office Naples-based John R.

The investors poured more than $3 million into the home.The group listed the home at $11 million from 2016 until August, according to Crain’s. It was relisted in November at $7 million, which would have allowed the investors to break even on the deal.Now the home is seeking $6 million in the hope a buyer can be found this year, listing agent Lisa Petrik of Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty told Crain’s.The Burr Ridge mansion isn’t the only luxury home struggling in the current housing market, which has seen sales drop precipitously this year.

The deal was brokered by Steven Rapaport of Chicago Real Estate Resources Inc.The four-story building is located in the booming West Loop, and is around the corner from some high-profile developments.

His assessment of Aon Center more than doubled to $886 million and jumped 30 percent to $95.4 million for apartments at Aqua Tower.The move is part of Kaegi’s campaign pledge to revamp property tax assessments. Since taking office three years ago, Kaegi made sweeping changes that agitated commercial property owners. This year, he moved to assessing properties in downtown Chicago from the suburbs, infuriating landlords.“It makes no sense,” Farzin Parang, executive director of the Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago, told Crain’s. “It’s very political to us. He’s constantly pitting business versus residents.”Critics say that Kaegi is raising assessments even though the pandemic has prevented people from returning to offices. The business district vacancy rate rose to 17.9 percent in the third quarter from 17.3 percent in the prior three months.Kaegi previously told The Real Deal that “assessments are out of date and there are huge inequities.” He said, “I don’t know the alternative that is being proposed instead of market value.”Kaegi’s office says the focus is on accuracy. His predecessor, Joseph Berrios, is under investigation by a federal grand jury probing property value estimations his office made on a number of central business districts and high-end neighborhoods.“The days of favoritism in the assessor’s office are over,” Scott Smith, a spokesman for the assessor, told Crain’s.While downtown landlords will file appeals, it may be an uphill battle.Willis Tower, for example, was assessed by Berrios at $697 million in 2018, even though Blackstone paid $1.3 billion for it in 2015 and invested an additional $500 million two years later. That suggests Kaegi’s assessment may not be that far off the mark.Ares Management bought the 82-story Aqua Tower for $191 million in 2019, when it was assessed at $254 million, well below its most recent valuation of $95.4 million.Aon Center, however, was valued at $824 million when it was refinanced three years ago by a venture led by 601W, well below Kaegi’s assessment.If landlords aren’t satisfied after filing appeals to the assessor’s office, they can turn to the county Board of Review or the Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board. Kaegi doesn’t have a final say on the value of the properties.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

MANICA’s most recent projects include the Las Vegas Raiders’ new $2 billion Allegiant Stadium, as well as the San Francisco Warriors Chase Center. Founder and principal David Manica worked on national and international projects such as the Las Vegas Raiders Headquarters and Training Facility, VTB Arena Park, Cagliari Calcio Stadium, The Inter-Miami MLS Training Facility, The Mercedes-Benz Arena in China, and The Shantou Sport Park.CAA also worked on the Raiders project with MANICA as well as the 1060 project, a multiyear renovation of Wrigley Field.The firms add substance to the Bears’ plans to potentially relocate to Arlington Heights, a move that has been brewing since last September, when the Bears and Arlington Park owner Churchill Downs Inc. disclosed the NFL franchise had inked a $197.2 million agreement for the site, currently a racetrack. The deal isn’t expected to close until the first half of 2023.Ted Phillips, the team’s president and CEO, is leading plans for the relocation. Phillips secured the controversial $690 million renovations deal at Soldier Field two decades ago.

(Credit: Common by Paras Griffin/Getty Images; McCaffery via McCaffery Interests; aerial by Cushman & Wakefield)There has never been a shortage of development ideas for U.S. Steel Corp.’s massive stretch of vacant land on the South Side, now marketed as 8080 Lakeshore Drive.Two abandoned projects each involved building over 10,000 homes there, with one of the proposals including millions of square feet of commercial space along with a lakefront marina. Last summer, South Side-born rapper Common was also said to be interested, and had partnered with developers on another plan to bring hotels, entertainment venues and a movie studio. The site was also among five locations Chicago was considering for a casino, and the city planning commissioner suggested splitting the land into parcels then selling those off.So with all that interest, why has the 415-acre former South Works steel mill sat empty for nearly 30 years? It’s complicated, and while real estate brokers, developers and local elected officials remain divided on what to build in an area about the size of Downtown Chicago, they agree it’s too important to remain empty.Illinois is now in a near lockdown caused by the deepening coronavirus crisis, but industry pros believe the vast swath of land along Lake Michigan will play a vital role in Chicago’s future, both as a vehicle to attract more residents and as a means to expand its commercial core.Sarah Ware, principal and managing broker at Ware Realty Group, said some of the challenges with developing the enormous site involve bridging the gap between the property and the surrounding community.“So the question is, are you looking to develop U.S. Steel on its own as an island, or on your way to the 79th Street corridor in South Shore?” she said.City Planning Commissioner Maurice Cox said in January that he thought South Works was far too large for one developer, and suggested chopping it up.“When some are pointing out that it’s as big as the downtown, you start to understand the absurdity of turning that over to a single developer,” he said.Big plans\nToday, the empty site — U.S. Steel shut the plant in 1992 and demolished the buildings — still includes a fading sign partially covered by weeds. It shows a rendering of a $4 billion development a dozen years in the planning between U.S. Steel and Chicago-based developer McCaffery Interests. Abandoned in 2016, the project included a master-planned community with 13,000 homes, 17.5 million square feet of commercial space and a 1,500-slip marina. U.S. Steel pulled out when it was not able to finance the project.“The site itself was certainly worth the time and effort to see if we can do something with it,” said Dan McCaffery, CEO of McCaffery Interests in a recent interview with The Real Deal.There wasn’t anything disastrous that led to the split, he said. The steel company is not in the real estate business, McCaffery added. “They just wanted to put it up for sale and not stay in the partnership. But they’re still trying to sell it.” The company could use the cash infusion from a sale, after fallout from the coronavirus crisis prompted it to idle plants, cut its spending for the year and tap an $800 million credit line, the Street reported last week.A few years ago at the South Works site, Emerald Living planned to build a multibillion-dollar project that would include 20,000 homes. A unit of Ireland-based WElink, Emerald Living partnered with Barcelona Housing Systems, a Spanish builder of modular housing. Those plans fizzled in May 2018, when Emerald Living pulled out over contamination at the site, though U.S. Steel said it had been given the all-clear on any environmental problems from the Environmental Protection Agency, according to reports at the time.The $71 million mixed-use development plan from the group led by Common included a 128-acre film production campus with up to 20 sound stages, plus a sports and recreation complex affiliated with golf legend Greg Norman. The development team included Los Angeles-based developer Sam Nazarian, entertainment management company RoadTown Enterprises, New York-based Morris Nasser and Chicago-based DL3 Realty.Little has changed at the site since it was closed, though modest improvements have been made. In 2002, the Chicago Park District acquired 16.5 acres from U.S. Steel, which was eventually transformed into Steelworkers Park with the collaboration of McCaffery Interests.A spokesperson for U.S. Steel declined to comment on the property or any future plans for it.Marketing pitch\nShortly after ending its agreement with McCaffery, U.S. Steel hired Cushman & Wakefield to market the site, which is 10 miles south of Downtown. Cushman billed it as one of the largest contiguous infill- and waterfront-parcels for sale in the United States. Cushman remains the broker, but declined to comment.Anthony Hardy, agent at Marcus & Millichap, said potential environmental remediation concerns remain for any future developer.“Typically, those steel plants put out a lot of waste and pollution, and with one of the largest steel plants in America making steel in that location for over 100 years, it’s going to be a big challenge in terms of the environmental cleanup,” he added. Meanwhile, McCaffery said its sheer size is problematic. “It’s huge. So that alone is a challenge.”Ware also questioned whether splitting up the development into different parcels, and creating different proposals, would work. “I think that would be a challenge. You want something to be in tandem with what the overall vision is,” she said. “It can’t just be a regular developer or master planner. McCaffery to me was their best bet right now, but the hope is somebody can come in of that level to start it.”“Bite-sized pieces”\nOthers, like Hardy, believe separating the parcels is the way to ensure construction commences.“Part of the issue is that they keep trying to have one huge developer as opposed to breaking it into more bite-sized pieces, and get more developers involved,” he said.Hardy said he was excited about the prospects of the development. His family even toured the site and had planned to buy a home in the future development. “I really like the location,” he said. “I think it has a lot of potential.” He would also like to see some type of housing assistance to help make the homes affordable for more people in the community.McCaffery, who called South Works a “magnificent property,” likened it to a certain popular destination spot in Florida. “Orlando was a swamp until Disney developed it,” he noted. But he acknowledged with South Works, “despite the best of intentions by the best of people, there really hasn’t been an overall political push.” If ground is going to ever be broken on a massive project at the property, he added, “it’s going to have to have a huge public effort.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",8080 Lakeshore Drive

The Shoreline Sightseeing tour boat company has a launch at the site.Zeller Realty Group owned the office tower, retail space and adjacent Apple Store until October 2017, when Chicago-based Walton Street bought all three properties in a $360 million deal just before the store was scheduled to open. Then, in January, Walton Street turned around and sold the laptop-shaped Apple hub to Invesco in a $79 million deal.Apple pays about $125 per square foot in rent, roughly matching other landmark storefronts on the city’s most prominent retail strip, according to a marketing document cited in Crain’s earlier this year. But just one block down the river, at Trump International Hotel & Tower, tax documents show that brokers failed last year to sign tenants at rents below $30 per square foot.The sale is the latest in a year-long selling spree for Walton Street Capital, which was founded in 1994 by JMB Realty Principal Neil Bluhm. In the months leading up to the Apple store sale, the private equity firm sold a Rolling Meadows office complex to Philadelphia-based Rubenstein Partners and a West Loop low-rise to Maryland-based ASB Real Estate.Invesco claims more than $933 billion in global assets under its management, including multiple properties in Chicago.A spokesperson for Walton Street declined to comment on the sale, and representatives of Invesco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",401 North Michigan AvenueWalton Street

While the development is projected to be a property tax bonus for the city, it could take as long as 20 years to see the pay-off after the suburban government granted Martell a tax increment financing (TIF) deal.In February, Oak Forest established the city’s eighth TIF district including the project site. It will last for the next 23 years unless ended earlier, and allows for reimbursement to the developer by locking in property value baselines for all properties within the district, and taxing only at those levels even as construction projects raise values within the area.Any taxing bodies, such as the city and school districts, will continue to collect taxes tied to that baseline amount and won’t be able to tax new value until the district expires. The developer could be reimbursed for up to $15.6 million in TIF funds for the project. Once the end of the city’s agreement with Martell’s company is reached, the taxing bodies will charge the property owners within the district at full values, including the increases driven by Martell’s development.Logistics Property’s redevelopment agreement with the city states that the developer would be “unable and unwilling” to take on the project without those incentives.Oak Forest officials said the project site is currently worth just over $1 million, and with a completed warehouse its value could rise as high as $35 million, marking a potentially big payoff for the city once it can tax the Logistics Property warehouse at its full value, once completed.The proposed development site is bound by 167th Street to the north, I-57 to the east and south and Cicero Avenue to the west. It’s located across the highway from the developer’s LogiPark 57-80 in Country Club Hills, a development of 1.4 million square feet of warehouses that rose on a site where plans for an outlet mall stalled out after years of dormancy.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","57 and Highway 50, south of 167th Street"

He said he would like to see a bill as early as this month, and would like to start construction on the transit center by mid-to-late 2020.In response, Lightfoot told the Sun-Times she has “a lot of questions” about the project and that “we’re not going to ram through anything.”Dunn said he’s seeking the state action on his public-financing proposal now because there are federal funding programs ending this year that he would like to use.“We simply wanted to make the state aware of that,” Dunn said Thursday. “In that respect, timing is important.”Landmark has proposed a massive development to be built above train tracks alongside Lake Shore Drive, just west of Soldier Field. Plans call for as many as a dozen high-rises, a pedestrian bridge over Lake Shore Drive and a massive transit hub linking the CTA, Metra and Amtrak.The project was unveiled at a public forum in March. Since then, Landmark has made no formal requests of the city, and Dunn said he fully intends to have a robust community engagement process as the project winds through City Hall approval.“We’re not trying to force anything forward,” Dunn said. “We respect the process. We’re taking things a step at a time.”Wisconsin-based Landmark is seeking a public-private partnership with the state on One Central’s transit hub. Under the proposal, Landmark would build the $3.8 billion transit center, which renderings suggest could include multiple floors of commercial space. The state would reimburse Landmark with tax revenue and lease income from the transit hub. After 20 years, it would be turned over to the state.Dunn’s previous major projects include other public-facing developments like stadiums for the Minnesota Vikings and Detroit Lions. He said he is incorporating some best practices from those experiences in his plans for One Central, but added his proposal for the financing of the transit hub is a “very unique approach.”The state would be “getting the full benefit of the asset without taking the risk on the front end,” Dunn said.The Illinois General Assembly is holding a hearing on Dunn’s proposal next week. Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s office told Crain’s his administration is reviewing the proposal.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

They cut the price several times before selling it for $1.6 million this month. John Morrison of @properties had the listing. The buyers were not yet identified in public records. [Crain’s]Motel 6 at Elk Grove Village gateway sold for redevelopmentElk Grove Village officials agreed to buy a motel at a gateway to the suburb they are hoping to redevelop. The village will pay $5.3 million for the 140,000-square-foot Motel 6 at 1601 West Oakton Street, 10 months after buying the shuttered Elk Grove Hotel across the street for $5.6 million. The village voted earlier this month to pursue acquiring the Motel 6 through condemnation proceedings, along with a retail strip next door. Mayor Craig Johnson said he’s hoping to negotiate a deal for that property too. [Daily Herald]Oak Park mansion finally sellsAn Oak Park mansion that resembles a castle sold for barely more than it was bought for 16 years ago. The 114-year-old Hales Mansion at 509 North Oak Park Avenue had been on and off the market since 2006. Seller Leah Urbanosky and her former husband bought the 9,500-square-foot home in June 2003 for $1.5 million and undertook a significant renovation. Urbanosky first listed the home in 2006 at $2.7 million. It sold last week for $1.6 million. The buyers were Maria Emilia Fermi and her son, Brando Fermi Crawford. Jennifer Vande Lune of Coldwell Banker had the listing. [Crain’s]Nitti Development will build on Schaumburg propertyA northwest suburban school district is now turning to Nitti Development of Glendale Heights to develop a long-vacant parcel in Schaumburg. Palatine-Schaumburg High School District 211 actually chose M/I Homes to develop the land last year, but the firm backed out in April. The second-highest bidder, Pulte Homes, also backed out, leaving third-highest bidder Nitti as the district’s new choice. The firm bid $17.7 million for the property, almost $3 million less than M/I’s top bid. The firm now will lead the redevelopment of the 62-acre site bordered by Summit Drive, Plum Grove Road, Wise Road houses on Weathersfield Way.

The center – a museum, library and community center – was long billed as a transformational project for the South Side in general and the area around Jackson Park in particular. Yet out of town developers haven’t maintained buildings, locals struggle for housing loans and few people trust what the future will bring.In some buildings, trash is accumulating and requests for repairs are ignored, Tonya Trice, executive director of the South Shore Chamber of Commerce, told Crain’s.“Outside investors aren’t maintaining the properties the way they should,” she said. “There are growing concerns around management, upkeep of the buildings and the eviction rate of South Shore residents.”Construction of the center, announced in 2016 and approved by the city in 2018, began last September and is set to be finished in 2025.Pangea Properties, one of the largest landlords in South Shore and Chatham, is among local investors that have also drawn criticism. Pangea CEO Peter Martay told Crain’s the REIT has invested $400 million in the past 13 years on properties in underserved neighborhoods.It’s not just a residential issue. Many stores on 71st Street are empty while landlords collect a state tax break and await higher rents.Some residents are finding ways to redevelop housing stock and maintain affordable rents. Over the past two years Leon Stenneth, a South Side entrepreneur, bought two buildings in Chatham that were previously owned by out-of-town investors and needed repairs. Stenneth, who works as an tech engineer, made the repairs and was still able to make a profit while charging affordable rents.One way to improve the housing stock is to provide access to credit for residents and landlords who need to buy or renovate buildings, Crain’s reported. Money from the American Rescue Plan Act can be allocated to smaller landlords, for example.“We used to build housing for working people, and we don’t do that anymore,” Nick Brunick, an attorney at Applegate & Thorne-Thomsen who specializes in affordable housing, told Crain’s.Housing advocates also recommend shared ownership, in which residents pool their money to buy property, and citywide gentrification protection like those the City Council established in Woodlawn to include affordability requirements for developments built on city-owned land.The South Shore still has plenty of abandoned buildings.\n“Some of the buildings are encumbered with debt,” Chicago Housing Commissioner Marisa Novara said. “It’s not our goal for out-of-town investors to maximize profits on these buildings.”[Crain’s] — Miranda DavisContact Miranda Davis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n Tenant advocates call for rent protections near Obama Center \n Interra realty brokers pair of multifamily deals on Chicago’s south side \n As South Shore booms, local investor seeks a big payout on 4-building portfolioAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The project still needs re-zoning approval and final approval from the City Council.Retail space in the tower will be about one-third cheaper than nearby space, Goodman said, in response to aldermanic concerns that development in the West Loop is pushing out smaller, “mom and pop” businesses.Some 6.6 million square feet of office space is in the works in Fulton Market, including 1.7 million square feet on one block alone from Sterling Bay.Prolific Fulton Market developer Shapack Partners is building a seven-story, 70,000-square-foot office project at 811 West Fulton Street and another office project at 215 North Peoria Street.And Shapack and Focus Development are planning a massive mixed-use project that would span the area between Halsted and Green streets.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",999 W Wayman Street

Lunt Avenue, according to Block Club Chicago. The building is a 100-year-old, historically protected building that was most recently a sober group living home.It’s again being vehemently opposed by the next-door congregation of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness Chicago, which has been based at 1716 W. Lunt Ave. since 1979.“When people get really annoyed or mad, sometimes they make not good decisions and they are actually threatening,” Sapna Patel, a member of the congregation, told Block Club. “We see again and again, people do take the wrong decision and do harm to a community. It would be scary for me and my kids.”The Krishnas are worried their chanting and singing, which starts as early as 4:30 a.m., could cause tension with their neighbors. Their festivals can also last past midnight, Block Club reported.The Krishnas are also concerned their neighbors might have parties or grill meat, which could disturb the vegetarian congregation.“I’m really concerned about this massive increase in density affecting our ability to practice our religious worship,” said Edward Suda, according to Block Club.\nGassman said at a community meeting last week that he is asking for Alderman Maria Hadden’s support on rezoning. Hadden’s office is seeking feedback on the proposal.\nGassman first proposed adding onto the Lunt property in 2017, a year after he bought it from Lutheran Social Services, which ran the sober home. Former Alderman Joe Moore denied the zoning change needed for the addition, saying the project required a business district designation in a residential area, according to Block Club.[Block Club Chicago] — Harrison ConneryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1710 West Lunt Avenue

09:30 AM",Thor Equities’ hammer can’t be swung as hard as the landlord thought against a Chicago marijuana tenant in federal court.,"[""Thor Equities’ CEO Joseph J. Sitt and 942-944 W Fulton Market in Chicago (Loopnet, Thor Equities, Getty)Thor Equities’ hammer can’t be swung as hard as the landlord thought against a Chicago marijuana tenant in federal court.A cannabis business, MedMen, is trying to keep Thor’s lawsuit over alleged unpaid rent at a Fulton Market space from moving into a state court, arguing that marijuana’s federally illegal status prevents its landlord from being able to enforce a lease.Thor this week voluntarily dismissed its suit against the tenant in New York federal court after MedMen raised that defense. The landlord stated it planned to refile its case in a state court within a jurisdiction that the weed business is legal and regulated.MedMen is trying to make sure that can’t happen. The tenant filed a new lawsuit against Thor Wednesday in the federal Southern District of New York to prevent the private equity firm from seeking a new venue.The latest lawsuit by MedMen demonstrates the lengths some tenants will go to fight their landlords as the cannabis sector gains greater recognition as an industry while still operating within a patchwork of varying state and federal regulations.In the suit, as in its motion to dismiss the earlier federal case Thor had filed, attorneys for MedMen argue its lease is illegal and thus unenforceable under federal law, as marijuana remains a Schedule I narcotic. The tenant goes on to demand a judgment declaring the lease void.The filing doesn’t dispute that the tenant hasn’t paid rent since before August 2021 and surrendered the premises at 942-944 West Fulton Street to Thor Equities in February. Attorneys representing MedMen and Thor didn’t return requests for comment.Thor sued MedMen earlier this year for almost $1 million in unpaid rent at the property. The cannabis company had leased the space for more than two years. MedMen owed more than $950,000 for failing to pay the base rent of $70,727, operating costs of $2,667 and insurance costs of $556 for 11 months, according to Thor’s initial complaint.The dispensary inked a 15-year lease for the 23,000-square-foot warehouse-style space in August 2019, months before Illinois legalized marijuana on Jan. 1, 2020. The lease provided for an annual rent of $800,000 that will increase each year to $1.2 million in the fifteenth year.This isn’t the first time Thor has sued a cannabis company over unpaid rent. The High Times dispensary had to pay Thor $4.9 million as a result of a lawsuit, though the company never opened in San Francisco.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",944 West Fulton Street

The team has also confirmed that the new stadium will be domed — a longtime pain point of the often-frigid Soldier Field.Plans for the 326-acre development include restaurants, office space, fitness center, parks and a hotel. The $9.4 billion project is estimated to create about 48,000 jobs for the area during construction, and bring in $1.4 billion in annual revenue for the team.A first look at the Chicago Bears’ planned Arlington stadium (Hart Howerton/Chicago Bears, Getty)The Bears said that while the team won’t seek taxpayer funding to build the stadium itself, but would need it for the rest of the project.Last month, a poll conducted by Americans for Prosperity, a Wichita, Kansas.-based organization founded by David and Charles Koch purported that most (72%) Arlington Heights voters wanted the stadium, but most (68%) were not okay with paying for it through taxpayer funding.The project plans indicate that the stadium would be built along Route 53 and the Metra commuter tracks with a mixed-use district directly southeast.A first look at the Chicago Bears’ planned Arlington stadium (Hart Howerton/Chicago Bears, Getty)The Bears have called Soldier Field home for half of a century, but its 62,000 seating capacity has become among the smallest in the NFL.The team signed a preliminary agreement to buy the Arlington racetrack from Churchill Downs last September after it had shut down earlier in 2021.“We remain under contract to purchase the property, but there are conditions that must be met if we are to be in a position to close,” the Bears’ statement said. “While under contract with the seller of Arlington Park, we will not be discussing or exploring any other alternative stadium sites or other opportunities, including renovations of Soldier Field.”The Bears will hold a community meeting at Hersey High School in Arlington Heights where residents can discuss the plan further with the team.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Even though the stop-work order is still in place, 45th Ward Ald. Jim Gardiner recently said the order had been lifted.Erroneously ignoring the work stoppage, at a recent meeting with Old Irving Park community members Gardiner said the council was “very excited about the roughly $100 million project and we think it will be a new shot in the arm for the Six Corners community.”The record was set straight when Department of Buildings spokesperson Michael Puccinelli told the outlet that the order “remains in full effect for any renovation and new construction as no building permits for that work have been issued.”The city is also still in the process of reviewing the illegal work that was done this summer to see if it was up to code, Puccinelli said. The work done includes the construction of an additional story as well as steel columns and exterior concrete. The only permits that were issued for the project were for interior demolition.Puccinelli said Novak has been cooperating with the city and is working to secure the necessary permits.The $90 million project will yield 206 apartments ranging in size from studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms. All of the units will be affordable housing with rents of $2,750-$3,000 a month.The plans call for about 50,000 square feet of Target-anchored retail on the ground floor and a fifth-floor addition.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",4738 West Irving Park Road

(350 North Orleans, Murphy Real Estate Services)John Murphy is making a big bet on Chicago’s downtown hotel market recovery.The developer is leading a venture to revamp the Holiday Inn Wolf Point, Crain’s Chicago Business reported. The deal is said to total nearly $23 million for the leasehold interest in the 522-room hotel, which occupies the top floors of an office building in River North.Murphy plans to purchase the interest from a partnership connected to the estate of Edward Ross, the late Chicago developer who built the hotel in 1976. Murphy will execute a 99-year ground lease with Blackstone Group, which now owns the building. He’s “in a position to close,” he told The Real Deal, but declined to comment in more detail.The hotel has been closed since the start of December, according to its answering machine.But it’s gained some new neighbors during its dormancy, as Houston-based developer Hines finishes up a trio of towers near the hotel. These include two residential towers and a 1.2-million-square-foot, 60-story office tower designed by Pelli Clarke Pelli and anchored by software company Salesforce.Little is known about his plans for the Wolf Point Holiday Inn, but Crain’s reports that he intends to redevelop the hotel with a different brand from the IHG Resorts & Hotels family, indicating it could be headed in a more upscale direction.Murphy has a penchant for redeveloping aging downtown properties into hotels and luxury residences. He recently overhauled the former Cook County Hospital into a Hyatt Place and Hyatt House hotel.The move comes at an uncertain time for Chicago hotels. In May, the Illinois Hotel & Lodging Association asked Mayor Lori Lightfoot to set aside $75 million to help hotels battle back from their pandemic malaise. While some of the city’s hotels, like the Westin Chicago River North and Sheraton Grand have reopened, others have recently hit the market.Downtown hotels reached 42 percent occupancy in the closing week of May, a peak since the pandemic began, though still far lower than in pre-pandemic times, when 80 percent of rooms were typically filled.[Crain’s] — Joe LovingerAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

01:00 PM","For office leasing in Chicago, it’s all about the new construction and about the amenities that go with it.","[""151 North Franklin, 625 West Adams and the Old Post Office building (Credit: Curbed and Wikipedia)For office leasing in Chicago, it’s all about the new construction and about the amenities that go with it.The demand for newer, Class A office space in the city has been siphoning leases from older, Class B properties, according to ReJournals, citing a third quarter Savills report.Vacancy rates for newer office properties fell to 13 percent from July through September, while the older office properties remained at 18 percent, according to the report.Savills’ Robert Sevim said the disparity comes from a rise in the number of tenants who want the more modern features and amenities — like open-air space and day care services — that Class A office spaces offer, hoping it will help attract and retain more employees.For the third quarter, a total of 2.5 million square feet of Class A office space was leased, almost 75 percent all total office space, according to the report.Not surprisingly, the trendy West Loop and Fulton Market areas were home to eight of the 10 largest Class A leases in the third quarter. Three of those were for 601W Companies’ $800 million Old Post Office building. Recent high-profile tenants like Uber and Walgreens have inked major leases there. WeWork and PepsiCo may also take a combined 320,000 square feet at the building, according to recent reports.And where demand has spiked, construction of Class A offices has grown. Many of those new construction buildings have been absorbed into the market over the past year. While vacancy rates have risen slightly, industry pros say they are keeping up with the flood of new development. Migrating or expanding companies also promise to gobble up much of the new space — as demonstrated by the big leases by Salesforce, BMO Financial and Walgreens announced for those three buildings last spring.

12:01 PM",You don’t have to travel far to find a market that rivals the apartment boom in downtown Chicago.,"[""1450 Sherman Avenue in Evanston, the site of a 273-unit project (Credit: City of Evanston)You don’t have to travel far to find a market that rivals the apartment boom in downtown Chicago.This year, developers are on track to complete about 3,500 apartment units in the Chicago suburbs, just 300 fewer units than are expected to be delivered in the city of Chicago before the calendar turns.It’s the biggest annual total since at least 1996, when Ron DeVries, senior managing director of Integra Realty Resources, started tracking suburban development. A year ago, the firm projected\xa0about 3,000 units would come online in 2019.The expanding job market is driving the demand for housing, and many people are choosing to rent instead of own, Crain’s reported. Plus, young professionals who work in the suburbs can get more for their money in towns like Evanston and Oak Park than they could in Chicago.Additionally, the suburban market is increasingly catering to move-down renters, with developers building lavish, condo-style projects targeted toward empty nesters who sell their single-family homes after their children move out.Suburbs with big downtowns give renters easy access to restaurants and shops, and projects near train stations have been top of mind for developers.Since 2015, the most active suburbs for apartment development have been Evanston, where 1,079 units have been completed, follow up Oak Park with 1,056 units, according to Integra.Though the suburban apartment market has seen a lot of growth in recent years, it’s been fairly slow and steady, especially compared to the Downtown development frenzy. The average rent for a typical 900-square-foot apartment in the suburbs is $1,332 per month, up from $963 at the beginning of 2010.Overbuilding and oversaturation shouldn’t be an issue in suburban Chicago despite the activity given its vastness and adequate spacing between new supply, Crain’s reported.More than 13,000 additional units are in the works in the suburbs, but DeVries expects completions to fall to about 2,500 apartments next year due to rising construction costs, uncertainty surrounding property taxes and Illinois’ precarious fiscal condition, all of which could further curb development.

It will be Facebook’s 12th data center in the U.S.“Illinois has been on our list of targeted states for a while. The DeKalb location was at the top of that list,” said Rachel Peterson, Facebook’s vice president for data center strategy, in an interview with Crain’s.Facebook’s new facility will be nearly as large as the 1.1 million-square-foot Digital Realty facility, which is one of the world’s largest data centers, although it hosts multiple customers.Krusinski Construction will be doing the infrastructure for the park and the project. The facility is set to open in 2022.The move follows a new tax-incentive law that Illinois passed last year in hopes to attract more server farms.Chicagoland’s industrial real estate sector has remained strong despite the pandemic. In June, Amazon announced that it will build two fulfillment centers in Matteson and Markham.Outside of Illinois, investors have been eyeing the market in recent years.

Plans for a substantially larger building would likely require rezoning approval from the city. The reason for prohibiting another rink seems clear. Moro owns another Johnny’s IceHouse at 2550 West Madison Street.Meanwhile, nearby Fulton Market remains one of the hottest neighborhoods in the city, and in the fall a new 45,000-square-foot building at 1100 West Fulton Market was on track to break a price-per-square-foot record, if it sells for its full asking price. Developed by Fulton St Companies, the property entered the market in October for more than $40 million. That breaks down to about $881 per square foot, which would break the neighborhood’s all-time record.Most of Chicago’s real estate market, however, has been battered by Covid-19.

J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order, which now runs through April.

10:07 AM","A modern Chicago tower is about to lose its two largest tenants, testing the value of youth in the city’s office market, where newer buildings have better weathered the pandemic that has driven up vacancy rates.","[""Irvine’s Jonathan Brinsden with 300 North LaSalle Street (Irvine Company, Google Maps)A modern Chicago tower is about to lose its two largest tenants, testing the value of youth in the city’s office market, where newer buildings have better weathered the pandemic that has driven up vacancy rates.Boston Consulting, a major tenant at the Irvine Company-owned building at 300 North LaSalle Street, is set to sign a lease at a new Fulton Market building in development at 360 North Green Street, according to a source familiar with the negotiations, while the law firm Kirkland & Ellis has already committed to leaving its 660,000 square feet on LaSalle for a massive new lease in the Salesforce Tower set to open in 2023.Their departures show even relatively new office buildings aren’t totally insulated from serious threats, even as analysts warn older buildings in the nation’s largest office markets of New York, San Francisco and Chicago will bear the brunt of the pandemic’s damage.How the 13-year-old River North building responds will indicate just how deep landlords are willing to wade into the amenities arms race to maintain property values and the cachet that draws top-tier tenants.“There is going to be another large hole,’’ said Ben Cleveland of Stream Realty, who represents Vornado in leasing offices at the Merchandise Mart adjacent to the LaSalle property.“There are few large holes in assets of similar quality.”Companies are increasingly downsizing their urban footprints when their leases expire, and deals have been concentrated in brand new buildings with amenities like lounges, bars, gyms and rooftop decks in hotspots like Chicago’s Fulton Market.Whether Irvine decides it needs to invest even more into such perqs – it already features a 5,600-square-foot fitness center with locker rooms and retail including a steakhouse and coffee service – will be a signal to other landlords. Should its answer be yes, it will mean even newer properties that fetched premium sales prices a few years ago aren’t enough to compete with the latest development wave without substantial upgrades.“A building like this staring down the barrel of a gigantic vacancy that is effectively a new building, if anything, they will spend some money on even more lavish amenities,” said tenant representative Michael Pink, who leads MAP Real Estate.Irvine didn’t respond to requests for comment.Buildings like 300 North LaSalle still have an edge even without renovations over many other Chicago offices. Moves like Kirkland’s and Boston’s from young properties to the latest development sites will give other tenants a chance to upgrade into something built this century on LaSalle, perhaps spelling trouble for older Loop properties just across the Chicago River.“It’s a chance for [Irvine] to reassess its value proposition and improve the asset to cater to today’s tenant needs,” Cleveland said. “I am very optimistic that building will re-lease after that reassessment. It’s as much of an opportunity from a tenant standpoint as it is a detriment to the market.”He pointed to the turnaround that nearby River North office highrise 321 North Clark underwent in the early 2000s, when it was the same age as the LaSalle building as it lost anchor tenant Quaker Oats and a series of others, and its occupancy dropped to just eight percent from full.Hines and a partner bought it for $147 a square foot in 2001, invested in adding amenities and floor space, and sold it in 2006 for double its purchase price, the developer said. It was 80 percent leased last year when it landed a $296 million loan.After the LaSalle building was completed in 2009, it was bought in 2014 for a then-record price of $850 million by Irvine, and value looks to have been left intact so far, showing how much timing matters.Tenant departures have the potential to impact that, though. It’s still 96 percent occupied with the big tenants in place. Boston’s lease ends in 2024 and Kirkland’s in 2029 with an option to terminate in 2025, and DBRS Morningstar last reported Irvine’s $475 million loan set to mature in 2024 on the LaSalle property remains investment-grade.“There’s no reason the borrower has to worry about defaulting yet, but it’s one everyone has their eye on,” Manus Clancy of Trepp said. “This new partly remote work week will weigh on office values for older stuff and it doesn’t have to be that old. Delinquencies will tick up over time slowly. The market will come back but it will take time in New York and Chicago.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",300 North LaSalle Street

When the company’s sole tenant moved out late last year, R2 began converting the building into a mixed-use office and retail hub, according to leasing director and principal Matt Duhig.With R2 set to make the formal move next week, Duhig expects the remade space — which is already 80 percent leased — to benefit from a wave of new interest stemming from the City Council’s passage of the sweeping North Branch Framework Plan last year.The 160-acre island, bordered by the river to the west and the North Branch Canal to the east, was traditionally dominated by warehouses and manufacturers before it was rezoned to allow for retail and office space. Residential is still prohibited on most of the island.“There’s been a serious uptick in demand since this framework was passed, because there’s only so much space on the river for these retailers and restaurant operators to go,” Duhig said. “It’s destiny for an area that’s a five- or 10-minute Uber ride from Lincoln Park, Bucktown and the West Loop.”The building’s retail component will include a Hero Coffee shop, set to open in September. Hero already operates cafes in the Loop, West Town and the West Loop.R2 lists 23 Chicago properties in its portfolio, eight of which are on or within sight of Goose Island.Across the canal, R2 is building a 40,00-square-foot REI superstore at 1442 North Kingsbury Street. It joins a crop of new development along the “wild mile,” a stretch of waterfront set to include a boardwalk, fishing stations and “vegetative islands” facing Goose Island.

Pritzker and Mike Reschke with 115 South LaSalle Street (Getty Images, Matt Haas, LoopNet)Debt against the Loop towers that were a key to paving the way for Google to expand in Chicago sold for a discount of just more than a third from the original loan.Mike Reschke’s Prime Group bought Union Bank’s loan of $191 million on the 1.2-million-square-foot, two-building complex at 115 South LaSalle and 111 West Monroe streets. He paid $120 million, or around $100 per square foot, marking a loss of about $71 million for the lender, according to a person familiar with the deal.Reschke came out on top of competitive bidding for the debt.Union Bank hired JLL to market the debt for sale after the property’s previous owner––a venture of South Korea’s Samsung Life Insurance––lost its two largest tenants, BMO Harris Bank and law firm Chapman & Cutler. Their moves into the newly built BMO Tower at 320 South Canal Street left the LaSalle and Monroe offices almost entirely vacant and prompted Union Bank to swallow the loss on its loan.Union Bank declined to comment.Reschke’s subsequent deal to flip one of the buildings he acquired in assuming the debt––the LaSalle tower––to the State of Illinois for $75 million allowed Google to take the entire Thompson Center to the north at LaSalle and Dearborn streets. The state had previously planned to move back into the Thompson Center, where it has kept various offices for decades, based on Reschke’s plan to put as much as $280 million into renovating the building.Reschke set out to revise that plan when Google came knocking for more office space in Chicago, and said it wanted the entire 1.2 million square feet in the Thompson Center.Reschke and the state obliged once the deal for the buildings on LaSalle and Monroe streets fell into place.The developer called it “a miracle” that the former BMO building became available at a discount just as Google was on the hunt. He agreed to overhaul the Thompson Center as part of a new deal that calls for him to buy it from the state for $105 million and prepare it for a 2026 Google move-in. That required the state to agree to buy a 625,000-square-foot portion of the South LaSalle and Monroe complex from Reschke for $120 per square foot, up from the $100 or so per square foot he paid for the entire property.Reschke’s sale to the state also lowered his basis on the Monroe portion of the property to $45 million, or a little less than $80 per square foot. Such discounts on vintage Loop towers from the more than $200 per square foot recently fetched by others with higher occupancy rates will be necessary for developers such as Reschke who plan conversions of office towers to new uses like apartments.Transforming offices into apartments, for instance, is a pricey proposition. Financial barriers are expected by Chicago’s urban planning experts who have pushed for some of the pandemic-battered Central Loop buildings facing high rates of office vacancy to be turned into apartments.Reschke plans to keep the lower 13 floors of the Monroe portion of the former BMO property as offices and turn the upper 10 floors into as many as 300 apartments.Owners of other Chicago buildings facing financial risk as office tenants cut back on real estate amid the pandemic aren’t dealing with as much vacancy as Samsung was on the former BMO property, and other distressed property sales will likely occur closer to between 10 and 20 percent off the cost of their debt, the person said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",115 South LaSalle Street

The loan was secured by seven hotels.RLJ bought the 306-key Courtyard by Marriott in 2006, part of a 100-hotel portfolio it acquired from Indiana-based White Lodging in a $1.7 billion deal. The firm in 2017 launched a renovation of the building at 165 East Ontario Street, including interior work on 15 floors and a complete re-roofing.The mortgage comes on the heels of a bumpy year for hospitality REITS, whose stock prices flagged then recovered last year only to fall again during December’s stock market sell-off. At $17.89 per share, RLJ is up 9% from its January low point but well below its 2015 peak of $35.62 per share.The Magnificent Mile saw some of the city’s priciest hotel transactions last year, including Denihan Hospitality’s $83 million sale of the 297-key James Chicago Hotel. Marriott also sold the nearby Tremont Chicago Hotel at 100 East Chestnut Street in a $26 million deal.Downtown hotel operators saw huge spikes in revenue and occupancy last year, backed up by the city’s record levels of tourism and its enduring reputation as a convention destination. But the roughly 2,000 new rooms set to come online in the city this year might pressure property owners to keep their room rates flat or shell out for upgrades.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",165 East Ontario Street

10:27 AM","Chicago homebuyers are putting more money down, reaping the reward of savings enforced by stay-at-home lifestyles and – until recently – stock-market gains.","[""(iStock)Chicago homebuyers are putting more money down, reaping the reward of savings enforced by stay-at-home lifestyles and – until recently – stock-market gains.The median downpayment rose by just over 1 percent of the purchase price from the first quarter of 2020 and 2022, Crain’s reported, citing Realtor.com. It stands at 12.9 percent of the purchase price, compared with 11.8 percent in the last pre-pandemic months.The change is “a reflection of how competitive the market has become,” Danielle Hale, Realtor.com’s chief economist, said. “In a competitive market, one way for a buyer to stand out (in the seller’s eyes) is to offer a bigger down payment.”Another factor: more buyers have discretionary income from the stock market and shunning restaurants and other public events. Many buyers flush with cash used cheap money to hold down monthly costs, Hale said.Downpayments in dollar amounts rose to $29,000 in 2022 from $19,000 in early 2020, a 53 percent increase that also reflects higher prices. High-end buyers helped drive up the payments because they held more excess cash, said Leslie Struthers with Chicago-based mortgage firm Guaranteed Rate.“The high earners who were buying big houses with offices for the two of them, a pool, a yard, were putting down 30 and 40 percent to get the house because they could,” Struthers said.[CCB] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The tower had previously been headquarters of CNA Financial.John Buck and Morgan bought the 1.2 million-square-foot tower in 2016 for $108 million from CNA.JLL was hired to sell the building, which went on the market in August, for $375 million.The building is 92 percent leased, with major tenants including Northern Trust, which took over a large chunk of CNA’s old space — 400,000 square feet — and the Chicago Housing Authority. It recently underwent a significant renovation in which the owners added a 30,000-square-foot food hall managed by local restaurant group DMK.The building, known as “Big Red” due to its vibrant facade, was built in 1972 and designed by Graham, Anderson, Probst & White.After John Buck and Morgan Stanley bought the building, CNA moved its headquarters to a new 35-story office tower that the two firms built at 151 North Franklin Street.Editor’s note: The final closed sale price for “Big Red” was $376 million.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",333 South Wabash Avenue

The latest: host Alison Victoria Gramenos has offered to buy back a house from a couple who were featured on the show, and who are now suing for tens of thousands of dollars they spent on repairs, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.Gramenos said she would even live in the home.In the days after Anna and James Morrissey purchased the 4,000-square-foot Lincoln Square property, they experienced a slew of problems from a severe leak to improperly installed roof and windows. The couple purchased the home at 2308 W. Giddings Street for $1.4 million and say they spent $80,000 to fix the ‘plagued’ home.The Morrisseys filed suit against Gramenos and her ex-partner, Donovan Eckhardt, to have the sale reversed and to be compensated for the repairs.But that isn’t the only problem the reality show has faced. Chicago slapped “Windy City Rehab” with stop-work orders for violations of multiple construction codes. Some of those were eased in recent months. Gramenos also dropped Eckhardt and his development company from the show, and said she would finish the remaining episodes and projects on her own.And to tie up another loose end, she has made her offer to buy the Morrisseys’ home, and is seeking to dismiss their lawsuit.“She is interested in buying the house back and she would be glad to join the neighborhood,” Gramenos’ lawyer, Dan Lynch, told the Sun-Times.

(Getty, Google Maps)Nearly a decade after Michael Jordan listed his Highland Park castle, it’s still on the market, and has cost the Bulls’ all-time great over $1 million in property taxes.The lingering listing — all 32,700 square feet of it — has been well documented, but Crain’s was the first to report the seven-figure property tax bill.In 2020 alone, the tax bill totaled just shy of $130,000, according to the report, citing the Lake County treasurer records. Property taxes are mainly used to help fund the city’s public school system.Jordan’s Park City, Utah, home sold in December, a little over a year after it listed. (Zillow)Jordan, a billionaire and majority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats, first listed the home in 2012 at $29 million. The 6-acre spread with No. 23 emblazoned on the entrance gate has gone through a series of price cuts. But for the past few years, the mansion has been offered at $14.85 million. The home at 2700 Point Lane has also failed to sell at auction, and a few marketing tricks have been unsuccessful. Jordan, who built the home during his first marriage, kept it after his divorce and now lives in Florida with his second wife.Because of its price tag, size, proximity to a railroad track and many custom features, the sprawling estate has been unable to seize on the hot suburban market, both in the Chicago area and around the country.But another Jordan-owned home did sell in recent months, this one in Park City, Utah. The 9,500-square-foot mountain retreat sold for $7.5 million in December, after Jordan listed it in October 2019, according to Redfin. He had paid $7.9 million for the five-bedroom, eight-bathroom home at 7495 Purple Sage.

LaSalle Street, Chicago (Loopnet, iStock, Illustration by Kevin Cifuentes for The Real Deal)The value of Chicago’s Field Building at 135 South LaSalle Street dropped by $200 million since 2015, leaving the property owner just above water.A recent appraisal put the 1.3 million-square-foot building’s value at $130 million, a fraction of the $330 million it was appraised for in 2015, before longtime tenant Bank of America moved out of 830,000 square feet last year for its own namesake, 57-story building at 110 North Wacker Drive, Crain’s reported, citing Bloomberg.The new appraisal puts the building at less than 40 percent of its 2015 value, though it doesn’t put New York-based owner AmTrust Realty underwater on its $100 million mortgage.AmTrust refinanced the property in 2015 with the loan, keeping a smaller amount of debt on the building despite its value soaring from the 2008 purchase price of $188 million, a deal financed by AmTrust taking out a $100 million loan at the time to buy the property from Bank of America in a sale-leaseback, Crain’s reported.While AmTrust decided against taking out an even bigger loan while refinancing in 2015, it turned profits from the building as its owner, with the property’s net cash flow nearly $18 million annually, well over the $3.3 million yearly debt service the company paid, Crain’s reported, citing Bloomberg loan data.\nAt 88 years old, the LaSalle Street building, like others in the Loop, may need extensive renovations to compete again in Chicago’s office market, which has seen vacancy near record highs with the rise of remote work amid the pandemic and a preference for newer Class A buildings in Fulton Market among companies needing space.\xa0AmTrust is planning to put $100 million into renovating its six other Chicago office properties, but not 135 South LaSalle, it announced last fall, according to Crain’s.It is unclear if the company plans to hold onto the Field building or if it will surrender its deed to a lender. A person familiar with the company’s plans told Crain’s that would be considered.An adjacent building also is in potential trouble after losing a major bank tenant. A loan for almost $191 million is for sale on the 115 South LaSalle Street property, which is being vacated by BMO Harris Bank and a law firm that have occupied 900,000 square feet there for years, and are moving to BMO’s new namesake tower next to Union Station. The loan is expected to sell for less than that.Mortgage payments have also been missed at other buildings in the Loop, including at 175 Jackson Boulevard and 181 West Madison Street, The Real Deal reported this month.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",135 S.

Michigan Avenue (JLL, Google Maps)The Neiman Marcus building on Chicago’s Magnificent Mile was sold by UBS Realty Investors for an undisclosed price after six months on the market.The buyer, Silvestri Investments, is betting on the revival of Chicago’s famed shopping district at a moment when it’s struggling with a series of pandemic-related challenges: a dropoff in foot traffic as office workers stay home and tourism declines; rising crime in the area; and vacant storefronts.The 195,500-square-foot building at 737 N. Michigan Ave is the department store’s flagship location in Chicago. The company has leased there since it was built in 1983. The four-story building has the largest continuous storefront on Mag Mile at 200 feet.“Neiman Marcus is one of only eight trades on Michigan Avenue within the last decade and was highly sought after by both domestic and international capital due to the rare flagship offering on one of the world’s most renowned and proven high-street corridors,” JLL broker Amy Sands said in a statement.Both the seller and the buyer were represented by JLL, with Sands, Clinton Mitchell, Alex Sharrin and Michael Nieder representing the seller, while Christopher Knight represented the buyer. The real estate firm also arranged a seven-year acquisition loan for the buyer.When the building was listed in October, the Cook County Assessor’s office valued the property at $46 million.Perhaps the most important factor in the sale is the duration of Neiman Marcus’ lease, which was undisclosed. A longer lease will prove more lucrative, and increase what the property is worth to an investor.It was the chain’s second most-profitable location and is expected to post $123 million in sales last year, according to JLL. Sales were up 5 percent in 2021 compared with the same period in 2019, Crain’s reported.UBS bought the Neiman Marcus store and an attached office space in 1998 for $104 million. It wasn’t until 2020 that UBS split up the retail and office space. The offices weren’t part of the sale.Retail on the Mag Mile has suffered during the pandemic.

It also accounts for more than half the $330 million spent on March’s five biggest multifamily sales.March’s second-biggest multifamily deal involved CA Ventures, which sold its newly delivered South Loop complex to Diamond Realty Investments for $117 million. CA Ventures also recorded the priciest multifamily sale of February, when it offloaded its 227-unit Kenect apartment complex to Newcastle Limited for $85.5 million.The $330 million spent on March’s biggest multifamily sales easily eclipses the $239 million spent on the five biggest sales in February and the $115 million spent in January.All information comes from Cook County property records.1. Aqua Tower | $190.5 millionAres Management bought out JPMorgan Asset Management’s majority steak in the rental portion of Jeanne Gang’s futuristic tower in Lakeshore East for $190.5 million. The 86-story tower at 225 North Columbus Drive contains 474 apartments, 224 condos and a 334-key Radison hotel, with each section owned by separate entities. JPMorgan in 2010 paid $182 million for its majority stake in the apartments, but hired JLL in September to market it. Magellan Development Group, which developed the tower, still holds a partial stake in the rentals.2. 1140 South Wabash Avenue | $117 millionA month after selling off its Kenect complex in River West, CA Ventures also shed its South Loop rental building for $117 million. Buying the recently delivered complex is Diamond Realty Investments, which is the real estate arm of car manufacturer Mitsubishi. The deal is Diamond Realty’s first in Chicago. CA delivered the complex known as Eleven40 in 2018 and had it 90 percent leased after four months.3. 551 West North Avenue | $15.5 millionCalifornia-based affordable housing investors Avanath Capital Management paid $15.5 million for the 59-unit Renaissance North complex in Old Town. Developed and sold by Chicago firm Renaissance Companies, the complex has a contract with the Chicago Housing Authority requiring at least 18 units be set aside for public housing tenants. The deal is part of Avanath’s massive expansion in Chicago. Since buying the Old Town building, the firm paid $28.3 million for a 156-unit affordable complex in Uptown.4. 4625 South Drexel Boulevard | $4.2 millionInvestor Raphael Lowenstein picked up this three-story Washington Heights rental complex for $4.2 million.

Schneider kept some real estate he could use to net a larger profit for his firm JMS Capital Group’s suburban Chicago office play as it made a deal to sell part of a business park.The credit union BCU bought two buildings from JMS in Vernon Hills in the northern Lake County suburbs for $41.5 million, according to public records.A Schneider-owned predecessor company to Pennsylvania-based JMS bought the buildings in 2012 as part of a $37 million purchase of four structures in the Continental Executive Parke, which totals 294,000 square feet across the campus.The sale is the latest instance of multi-building campuses in Chicago’s northern suburbs of Lake County commanding some of this year’s priciest office deals.BCU, whose legal name is Baxter Credit Union, has long been a tenant of the campus occupying the 103,000-square-foot building at 340 North Milwaukee Avenue, and Schneider’s company moved on from the building as well as 300 North Milwaukee, a 78,000-square-foot office structure.In 2020, it struck an 11-year, $44 million lease with BCU to remain at the property after a year of negotiation, a JMS news release said at the time. Now BCU decided to buy instead of lease.While it’s already a gain for JMS over its purchase price, the firm still has a couple assets it picked up as part of its 2012 acquisition in the area it could capitalize. It held onto the 46,000-square-foot office building at 400 Lakeview Parkway as well as the 73,000-square-foot building at 560 East Bunker Court within the Continental park.JMS also put capital into renovating and upgrading both the BCU buildings in 2020, though the cost of those projects is unclear. Representatives for JMS and BCU didn’t respond to requests for comment.The price on the BCU purchase is well below the $190 million New York-based Northeast Capital spent to buy the four-building, 1.1-million-square-foot Kemper Lakes campus in Lake County that’s nearly fully leased. That was the priciest suburban office sale since 2005, before the firm Dermody closed on a $232 million deal to buy the former Allstate campus in Glenview, which is set to be converted into a massive, 10-building logistics center.Yet the BCU purchase valued the property across the two buildings involved at about $229 per square foot, a step up from the measure on the Kemper Lakes deal, which yielded seller Apollo Global Management $172 per square foot. The Continental Parke buildings were built between 1999 and 2002.Only select office buildings are trading hands, as shown by the tenant Baxter wanting to control its real estate. Rising interest rates have in most cases forced investors to wait until a more friendly borrowing environment is in place, once inflation is tamed.Earlier this year, Opal Holdings spent $180 million on the 697,000-square-foot Corporate 500 complex in Deerfield, long home to Caterpillar, which later announced it was moving its headquarters out of Illinois and put its entire 116,000-square-foot offices in the campus on the sublease market.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",300 North Milwaukee Avenue

All of the others returned to work long ago after concessions were made.Unite Here Local 1 spokesman Elliott Mallen told the Sun-Times that the union, which organized the strike, that he doesn’t know why the Cambria name was removed, but he speculates it’s related to lost business and declining standards as a result of the strike.The union estimated in July, almost a year after the strike began, that the strike had cost the hotel $300,000 in bookings.The main issue fueling the ongoing strike is the hotel’s demand for an increase in housekeepers’ daily quota of room responsibilities from 13 to 15, according to Mallen.The hotel is operated by Fillmore Hospitality and owned by the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System.

Fulgoni co-founded audience measurement firm ComScore in 1999. He retired as CEO early this year and is now chairman emeritus of the Virginia-based firm.The home is among a number of pricey recent listings and sales in the Gold Coast, including two mansions on State Street listed for north of $10 million last month.One block over, TV actor Alexandra Meneses and her ex-husband, hedge fund manager John Simpson, sold their 6,800-square-foot Gold Coast greystone in June for $6.58 million.In May, the nearby Queen Anne-style Thompson Mansion became the city’s second-highest residential listing when it hit the market for $21.9 million.The Thompson Mansion is around the corner from JDL Development’s No. 9 Walton, which has dominated the list of most expensive home sales in recent months.[Crain’s] — John O’BrienAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",65 East Bellevue Place

The project could help the cities move beyond their manufacturing heydays, though the bond issuances and the bet on real estate could be a gamble.In Fort Wayne, Indiana, city officials are issuing $45 million in bonds to help turn a former GE plant into a 30-acre mixed-use complex featuring apartments, retail and office space. Over 20 years, the $440 million development is expected to bring in more than $100 million to local coffers.The Fort Wayne project and others like it seeks to create the trendy live-work-play developments that have come to bigger cities. The hope is the new development can lure young, educated workers who may be priced out of cities like San Francisco and New York, developers told Bloomberg.The strategy has proved successful in some cases.In Allentown, Pennsylvania, the city used tax-exempt bonds to finance a retail, dining and office complex. After the exodus of Bethlehem Steel and Mack Trucks, the development has helped lure some big employers to the downtown, including Bank of America.The Fort Wayne project has already seen a number of employers, including Indiana University, announce plans to move into the development.

Suburbs are leading the retail recovery in the Chicago area as downtown areas such as the Loop and sections of the Magnificent Mile suffer from fewer office workers and a lack of foreign tourism while the pandemic lingers.Hubbard’s repositioning of the 140,000-square-foot property was fueled by a $40 million loan that the company and its Chicago-based partner, Keeler Real Estate, landed in 2019. That followed the venture’s 2018 purchase of the property for about $10 million after Kmart closed its store there along with dozens of others across the nation.The property sold to AEW for a little less than Oak Lawn City Manager Thomas Phelan had hoped.“We were told by retail investment experts that the property should sell for more than $80 million, which would make it one of the most valuable retail properties — on a price per square-foot basis — in the suburban Chicagoland area,” Phelan told the Chicago Tribune in January, when the property was marketed for sale.With Kmart out, the property at the busy intersection of 95th Street and Pulaski Road is now fully leased with a new set of tenants including Amazon Fresh, Duly Health Care, LA Fitness, Panera Bread, Shake Shack and Longhorn Steakhouse, according to Hubbard’s website.AEW declined to comment and Hubbard didn’t return a request for comment.In the year ending in March, there were 70 percent more retail property trades in the Chicago area than in the prior 12 months. The increase resulted in the most sales of retail properties for $1 million or more in the metro area than in any year since at least 2000, with a total of 830 deals for $3.5 billion, according to brokerage Marcus & Millichap.In January, AEW also added to its Chicago-area holdings with an $18.4 million suburban warehouse purchase in Arlington Heights.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Lake Havasu, Arizona; Eugene, Oregon; Springfield, Illinois; Shreveport, Louisiana; and Brownsville, Texas, had fewer foreclosures compared with 2021.By state, Illinois had the highest foreclosure rate, at more than a quarter of a percent of housing units. Close behind were New Jersey, at 0.24 percent, Ohio at 0.21 percent, Delaware at 0.2 percent and South Carolina at 0.19 percent.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

This figure is well below the $2.1 million Sterling Bay owed in debt service for that year, which could make it hard for a buyer to justify paying close to the property’s appraised value.Sterling Bay took a net loss when it sold the Talbott Hotel for $55 million this month.

Miami-based Crescent Heights has a history with KKR financing for NEMA Chicago, which opened its 800-unit luxury building in 2019.As the $300 million skyscraper at the south end of Grant Park in the South Loop was welcoming its first tenants then, Crescent Heights refinanced the original construction loan with a $340 million loan from KKR Real Estate Finance Trust. That loan paid off a previous $328 million KKR loan, giving Crescent Heights a chunk of the equity and a lower interest rate.KREST, a closed-end fund that also holds equity investments in stabilized real estate and single-tenant properties, said the “strong relationship” with Crescent Heights was behind the new loan. The transaction helped “enhance and further diversify our portfolio with NEMA Chicago,” said Billy Butcher, CEO of KREST and COO of KKR Global.Bank OZK gave Crescent Heights the go-ahead to break ground with a $203 million construction loan in 2017. The tower, with views of Grant Park, Buckingham Fountain and the Willis Tower, boasts amenities that include indoor and outdoor pools, high-end fitness facilities, conference meeting spaces and tenant lounges.Monthly rents range from $1,866 for a studio apartment to $25,000 for a penthouse. Two beds and two baths run from roughly $4,000 to $6,500.

Pat Dowell of the 3rd Ward. Both have previously criticized One Central, with Lightfoot speaking out against the way Landmark officials are conducting themselves and Dowell requesting numerous revisions.But Gov. J.B. Pritzker indicated his support when he backed legislation to allow the state to negotiate a deal in which it would effectively buy the transit center from Landmark with payments totaling about $1.9 billion over a period of 20 or more years.South Loop residents have expressed concern over the project’s size and access to the lakefront, among other things.Landmark is crafting a detailed pitch and related research, expected to be released as soon as next month, with the help of leading transportation and economic planning firms AECOM and WSP Global.Sources told Crain’s that former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus has been involved with Landmark’s activities on behalf of One Central.[Crain’s] -– Brianna KellyAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The plan also called for a 1,600-square-foot courtyard, a rooftop terrace and 56 outdoor parking spaces.Developer Matt Ferrino and investors from the Chicago-based Mavrek Development are also backing Interra’s half of the development, according to Interra managing principal Jon Morgan.The City Council in June approved the group’s requested zoning change from a manufacturing district to a B3-5 community shopping district, effectively blessing the proposal.The new owners took over the deed from Brown Legacy Group last week under the name Southport Stay LLC, simultaneously securing a $22.6 million mortgage from Midfirst Bank.Morgan and Interra’s David Gross brokered the sale.The new owners are “courting a variety of users” including hospitality, co-working companies and fitness centers for the commercial space, Morgan said Tuesday.Based in Moline, Illinois, the Heart of America Group manages at least 20 hotels and restaurants across the Midwest.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",71 North Southport Avenue

The site could accommodate as much as 1,000 apartments on 1.5 million square feet.The building on the site was once owned by Chicago Tribune parent Tribune Media. In 2018, Riverside and Tribune Media, which has since been bought by Dallas’ Nexstar, won City Council approval to demolish the vacant 115,00-square-foot building and build a four-tower office and residential complex. The companies gave up on those plans in April of last year after the pandemic crushed demand for office space.Onni’s property is a former Tribune advertising insertion plant that closed in 2012. At one point, Bally’s planned to use the site as a temporary casino while building its permanent one. The group now plans to instead use the Medinah Temple at 600 North Wabash Avenue in River North.Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in May that Bally’s bid had been accepted to build a $1.7 billion casino, which will include an entertainment center and hotel, at the 30-acre site just south of the old Tribune building in River West.Chicago developer Shapack Partners has also purchased property near the new casino site. A venture controlled by the firm bought the Salvation Army’s downtown River West campus for $25 million in May. The developer also plans to build a 1,110-unit apartment building and a hotel near the site.Bally’s also has the option to buy the 30-acre printing plant site from Nexstar for an undisclosed amount.Onni is responsible for the Halstead Point development on Goose Island, a project at the site of a former Greyhound bus maintenance facility at 901 North Halstead St. It will include a 300-room hotel and 1,400 parking spaces as well as Goose Island’s first apartments.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",700 West Chicago Avenue

Joe Moreno","Mar.March 04, 2019
02:00 PM","In his bid to become 1st Ward alderman, Daniel La Spata used the ward’s booming residential and multifamily development to draw a contrast between him and incumbent Proco Joe Moreno.","[""Daniel La Spata (Credit: iStock)In his bid to become 1st Ward alderman, Daniel La Spata used the ward’s booming residential and multifamily development to draw a contrast between him and incumbent Proco Joe Moreno.Among his campaign promises were a call for a more inclusionary zoning process and a vow not to accept contributions from developers.That strategy worked, with La Spata pulling off one of the biggest upsets of Tuesday’s election, beating Moreno with 61 percent of the vote. Now La Spata said he’s working to enact the policies he promised.And could mean big changes for developers and landlords in the 1st Ward, which encompasses portions of Wicker Park and Logan Square.La Spata’s vow to forgo donations from developers hasn’t really been an issue yet. During the campaign, developers and real estate industry figures made their preference for Moreno well known, making up nearly 60 percent of all funds he raised since 2018.La Spata’s only real estate-related campaign funds came from the Strauss family, who drew Moreno’s ire when they evicted the Double Door from its Wicker Park location.Now La Spata will have power to grant or deny developers’ requests, and he said refusing their money will restore trust in the zoning process and will make the system more fair for developers.“To take the money factor out of it helps to restore trust and restore good faith that community zoning processes are worth participating in,” he said.La Spata has been advocating on housing issues for some time. He cut his teeth working with the Chicago Rehab Network, an affordable housing advocacy group, and the Logan Square Housing Association, where he co-chaired its committee on housing and land use.La Spata said some of the development that’s taken place in his ward — much of it tall rental units buildings by Blue Line stops — has been good for the community. But some has not reflected the needs of the neighborhood, he said.“The density overall that we’ve seen, many in the community have viewed as being out of scope with the overall development of the community,” La Spata said. “From an equity perspective, as we look to the needs of a lot of families whose housing needs are not being met, there is a need to, in a predictable way, incentivize the creation of more affordable units and more affordable family-size units. That’s going to take a negotiation.”The 1st Ward is seeing a boom in residential and multifamily development, thanks in part to the transit-oriented-development ordinance that allows for more density near train stops and major bus routes. La Spata said the law has done good things for the ward and city, but he said tall, often expensive rental buildings can’t be the only way to add density.“I think there’s a need and desire for all housing types in the 1st Ward,” he said. “I just want to make sure we’re promoting them.”That includes maintaining the ward’s stock of two- and three-flats, and working to make sure they aren’t deconverted. La Spata said he also will advocate for adding “gentle density” through the incentivizing of carriage houses and other accessory units.But he’s not on board with further regulating or eliminating single-family zoning, which has been used in cities like Minneapolis to try to promote affordability.“The trick of it is, there is no magic bullet for an affordable neighborhood,” La Spata said. “Inclusionary zoning is a tool, but it can’t be the only tool. The same way for 100 percent affordable new construction. Chicago as a whole needs a much more comprehensive set of policies and procedures for maintaining its affordability, and really becoming more affordable.”Another big issue in La Spata’s campaign was the ballooning property tax bills for some Logan Square homeowners, who saw assessments rise by 50 percent. He said he plans to work with new Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi to address the issue.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The 16 percent drop between the original listing and closing prices aligns with the gaps settled on by other sellers in the affluent North Shore suburb this year.Ann Lyon (@properties)Jennifer Niemann is the CEO of Forward Space, an office furniture dealership based in Chicago. Ann Lyon with @properties represented the Niemanns and did not respond to a request for comment on the pricing strategy. Frank Capitanini with Coldwell Banker Realty represented the buyers.Last month, a century-old lakefront Winnetka mansion sold for $12.75 million, though it was originally listed for 20 percent more at $16 million. At that seven-bedroom property on 645 Sheridan Road, the buyers plan to replace it with a new home. Built around 1902, it needs repairs and renovations, according to the buyer’s agent.Back on Taylorsport Lane, the Niemanns’ former five-bedroom, six-bathroom home was built in 1981 and features 100 feet of beachfront on Lake Michigan. It was expanded and renovated over the last four years, according to the public listing.The Niemanns bought the home in 2016 at an even larger cut from the initial asking price for $3.7 million, down from the $5.75 million that its previous owners Roy and Elizabeth Skillicorn sought at the time.Despite the price cut, it’s one of 10 sales of $5 million or more this year in Winnetka, where demand has doubled for such high-end homes compared to the five sales at or above that mark in all of 2021. The suburb’s luxury market surged even as the rest of the Chicago market cooled due to rising interest rates.Winnetka’s other high-end properties also sold for below their initial listing prices, though not always by as much.In August, the former Winnetka home of Arthur Nielsen, founder of the A.C. Nielsen Company, sold for $6.8 million after four months on the market and down from the $6.9 million listing price.

05:57 PM","Chicago gave the go-ahead to a massive, $3.8 billion redevelopment on the lakefront site of the former Michael Reese Hospital, promising economic revival for the predominantly Black neighborhood.","[""(Bronzeville Lakefront)Chicago gave the go-ahead to a massive, $3.8 billion redevelopment on the lakefront site of the former Michael Reese Hospital, promising economic revival for the predominantly Black neighborhood.The City Council overwhelmingly approved Bronzeville Lakefront, a years-in-the-making 7.8 million-square-foot mixed-use project led by Farpoint Development.The city will sell the 48.6-acre site to the Farpoint team for $96.9 million. Aldermen also approved spending $60 million from Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s capital plan for street repair and construction and a two-acre park; and agreed to rezone the property.Over the next two decades, GRIT plans to transform the site, building 4,800 residential units and 15 million square feet of office and retail space. The team includes Draper & Kramer, McLaurin Development Partners, Loop Capital, Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives and the Bronzeville Community Development Partnership.The $600 million first phase will develop the site as a life sciences campus focused on health and biomedical technology. The plan includes a 500,000-square-foot laboratory and office facility housing the first U.S. arm of the Israel-based Sheba Medical Center, often referred to as the Mayo Clinic of the Mideast.Sheba said it will occupy 25 percent of the ARC Innovation Center – for Accelerate, Redesign and Collaboration – that will be managed by Chicago-based Kaleidoscope Health Ventures as a home for innovative researchers and startups. The city has targeted life sciences as an economic engine for future growth.Infrastructure construction is expected to begin this fall on the first phase, which also will include senior housing and the Bronzeville Community Center. It could be completed by 2023.The development is one of three multibillion-dollar projects approved since 2019 but is the only one in a minority community. Supporters of the project say it will create jobs and provide housing for low-income residents in neighborhoods including Englewood, Auburn-Gresham and Chatham that have been marred by unprecedented gun violence in recent years.“As the only multibillion-dollar development being planned for a community of color in Chicago, Bronzeville Lakefront will provide a strategic link between the growing central area and the systemically underinvested neighborhoods to its south,” said Maurice Cox, the city’s planning and development commissioner.The sale also unshackles the city from a money-losing proposition that began when former Mayor Richard M. Daley talked aldermen into purchasing the vacated hospital site in 2009.Convinced that Chicago was going to win its bid for the 2016 Olympics, Daley persuaded the council to take on an $85 million loan to build the Olympic Village. But Chicago failed to win the bid – Rio de Janeiro got it — and the property has sat vacant since, racking up interest payments that taxpayers have been paying.The project’s $3 billion second phase is expected to include more medical research facilities, office, retail and residential units. GRIT has agreed to set aside 20 percent, or roughly 1,000 residential units, at reduced rates for low-income tenants.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Pending village approval, work on the project is expected to begin next spring.Phil Domenico, principal at Synergy, said that it will likely take five years to complete and will include luxury apartments. And the final number of units in the final development plans, which will include a 3-acre park, will depend on zoning change.Village officials are discussing potential incentives for the project, including tax-increment financing and funds from a business taxing district that includes Yorktown.William Henniff, Lombard’s community development director, told the outlet that part of the existing mall will be redesigned to better connect to the park and apartment building.The village could approve the zoning change as soon as the beginning of 2023 and Domenico said the project got positive feedback at the community meeting about it.“We are in the business of transforming shopping malls,” Steve Plenge, CEO of Pacific Retail, told the outlet. “We believe we can add a vibrant mix of uses to create further densification to a site where people will want to live, shop, dine and be entertained.”The Yorktown shopping center is home to about 150 businesses, including major tenants Von Maur, Target and JCPenney.— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

11:00 AM",Boston’s TA Realty picked up a decades-old suburban Chicago office building from Walgreens Boots Alliance for $21 million as the pharmacy company eyes an expansion of its nearby headquarters.,"[""From left: Walgreens CEO Rosalind Brewer and TA Realty managing partner James P. Raisides in front of the Centerpoint Northbrook Business Campus at 4000 Commercial Avenue (LoopNet, TA Realty, Junior Achievement of Georgia, iStock)Boston’s TA Realty picked up a decades-old suburban Chicago office building from Walgreens Boots Alliance for $21 million as the pharmacy company eyes an expansion of its nearby headquarters.The 284,000-square-foot office campus with three buildings on 26 acres at 4000 Commercial Avenue in Northbrook had been known as the Walgreens Innovation Center, a research facility near the company’s Deerfield headquarters. Walgreens is planning a 14,240-square-foot addition to its Deerfield campus to replace the Northbrook property.Built in the 1970s, another company called Panattoni, based in Irvine, California, had proposed demolishing the mostly vacant Northbrook building and redeveloping it as a 400,000-square-foot industrial building. It’s unclear whether TA’s purchase of the building was made in tandem with Panattoni as a partner or if the Boston firm has separate plans for the property. Neither company responded to requests for comment.The site’s possible end as a traditional office building and its potential for redevelopment reflects the suburban Chicago market, which features record-high vacancies of 27.1 percent, according to JLL. Brokers have said the rate is driven upward by offices that are outdated and aren’t in prime locations, and have embraced shifts of some buildings away from office uses.Meanwhile, the industrial real estate market is booming amid the pandemic as vacancies in buildings of 200,000 square feet or more dropped to a record low of 2.6 percent in the Chicago area in the first quarter, and developers race to meet the demand. They put a record high amount of product in the pipeline in the first quarter, with 44 buildings totaling 23.7 million square feet underway, Colliers found.The Northbrook property is easy to access along Interstate 294 and was billed as a “great potential for redevelopment, additional development on the excess land on the site, or continued use as a flexible office or mixed-use building,” in a Cushman & Wakefield listing. About 50,000 square feet of the building is used as a merchandising and warehouse space with tall ceilings and dock doors, while the remaining 235,000 square feet is standard office space.TA Realty has made several other transactions in the suburbs of major U.S. cities lately, including this month’s $58 million purchase of a Whole Foods-anchored shopping center in Connecticut, the March sale of a suburban Miami office building for $25 million and a November purchase of a Safeway store and three other retail buildings for $77 million in Mountain View, California.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",4000 Commercial Avenue

The properties were found in violation of multiple construction codes, including working without permits, according to the report.The only property with an active stop-work order is the building at 1846 N.

Co-stars Alison Victoria and Donovan Eckhardt’s Greymark Development Group are still being prevented from applying for new building permits.“It’s only to correct past violations,” Gregg Cunningham, a spokesman for the Department of Buildings told Block Club. “We’re still monitoring the work closely…watching for any attempt to circumvent our process here.”HGTV and Victoria may be pushing Eckhardt out of the picture. Also in July, Victoria said she would be working with a new general contractor to finish the show.

The suit alleged Kameli charged undisclosed fees, commingled funds and used the money for unauthorized purposes.A federal judge dismissed the suit last week for procedural reasons, but gave regulators until April 11 to refile it. Kameli, an immigration attorney, still faces other lawsuits over the assisted-living projects, only one of which ever was completed.Kameli was able to regain control of that property, the 60-unit Bright Oaks of Aurora in the west suburb, with a $12.7 million bid in a bankruptcy auction last month, Crain’s reported.The federal EB-5 visa program received another short-term extension last month, but faces a number of pressing issues. One of the biggest is the weakened demand from Chinese visa seekers — who comprise a large share of the applicants. While it has been credited with creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and contributing billions of dollars to help finance large-scale projects, notable fraud cases involving EB-5 projects have also surfaced.New York-based Symmetry Property Development is being sued by 60 Chinese investors who want the firm to return $50 million they invested in a failed tower project in Chicago’s River North neighborhood.

Monroe (Credit: Google Maps)Maybe this will kickstart the painfully slow investment sales market in downtown Chicago.Spear Street Capital is under contract to buy the 46-story, 967,00-square-foot skyscraper at 500 W. Monroe from Georgia-based Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Real Estate Alert reported this week. While the sale price is unknown, bids reportedly ranged from $415 million to $425 million, putting the sale price somewhere around $440 a foot.Piedmont initially sought upward of $490 million for the building when it was put on the market in May. Though that price may not have been met, it looks certain that Piedmont will turn a tidy profit. Piedmont, which was once the mezzanine lender on the property, took full ownership in 2011 at foreclosure auction, valuing the property at just under $228 million at the time.The deal could mark a turning point for downtown investment sales, which have been slow in 2019, in large part due to an upcoming reassessment.The deal at 500 W. Monroe marks the first recent sale among several downtown investment listings that went up since last January — including Angelo Gordon & Co.’s Citadel Building and AmTrust’s $1.3 billion, seven-property portfolio.It appears Spear Street Capital was more interested in a turnkey property than a value-add project. In this case, Piedmont spent about $84 million in renovations and brought the occupancy level up to near capacity.Spear Street Capital has interests in about two dozen office properties throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe.

The acquisitions are often made through land banks at bargain prices because no other investor is willing to take the risk.In Springfield, Ohio, the Clark County land Reutilization Corporation bought up the Upper Valley Mall for $3 million. It is now in talks with investors to redevelop it into a mixed-use site with housing, a soccer field and retail component.Memphis, Tennessee, bought the Raleigh Springs Mall then demolished it last year to make way for a $28 million Raleigh Town Center, the Journal reported. It will have a library, police station, skate park and 11-acre lake.Malls have suffered from declining foot traffic and competition from online retailers. Many anchor tenants have vacated spaces or gone out of business entirely, forcing owners to scramble to fill vacancies.The new owners of the Westside Pavilion mall in Los Angeles, Hudson Pacific Properties and Macerich, are converting 500,000 square feet there into an office park.A JLL study found that 21 percent of retail-based co-working spaces nationwide are in malls, including one in Chicago.But big-box properties are hard to redevelop for other uses because of large floor plates and no windows.Disputes over uses can also hold up a redevelopment, according to the Journal. In some cases, malls comprise numerous parcels owned by different entities, which means a local government has to spend the time to buy them all.

That will probably save the company money, because the mortgage has a rate of 3.58 percent, lower than it would cost to borrow now.While FPA sold its Bensenville property, it still owns the Lex in the South Loop, McClurg Court in Streeterville and the Wheaton Center apartments in Wheaton.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",100 George Street

The seller, Elmhurst-based Value Industrial Partners, acquired it for about $5 million in 2014, according to the firm’s Brian Gedvilas.Gedvilas admitted his firm did well with the deal but declined to comment.Unilev, which has offices in California, Texas, Minnesota and Colorado, didn’t respond to an inquiry. Its portfolio covers more than 6 million square feet, according to its website.The sale of the Arlington Heights property is the latest in a string of industrial properties trading for multiples of their previous sale prices across the Chicago suburbs in recent months. Values of asset classes including warehouses, truck yards, data centers and vacant land have soared, fueled by consumers’ growing reliance on e-commerce and a short supply leading to competition for space among tenants.Massachusetts’ High Street Logistics Properties picked up a 252,000-square-foot warehouse in Itasca for $36 million in August, more than four times the property’s value a decade ago. And in September, Hawaii’s James Campbell Company sold a 215,000-square-foot warehouse in Franklin Park for more than $30.3 million, tripling the property’s value.Meanwhile, Chicago industrial developers have never been busier as they build to fill the demand. The Chicago area hit a new record for the number of construction starts in the third quarter, with 17.2 million square feet of buildings across 48 projects getting underway.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",571 West Golf Road

It would include one-, two- and three-bedroom units, a rooftop deck and just 29 parking spaces, owing to the city’s transit-oriented development rules that limits vehicle spaces.The building is one of three rental ventures planned for the 1700 block of Western Avenue, just south of the Western CTA Blue Line station.Across the street, MCZ Development landed permits earlier this year for a 25-unit apartment building at 1741 North Western Avenue. And down the block, LG Development broke ground last month on a 109-unit complex at 1750 North Western Avenue, after buying the site from GW properties.All three sites are inside the city’s Milwaukee affordable housing pilot zone, meaning they must rent at least 15 percent of their units below market rate, with no option to opt out of the requirement by paying a fee. Some developers have blamed the rules for snuffing out construction. But Bernshtam is one of more than a dozen developers who has moved forward with construction under the new rules since they were implemented in late 2017.

Shay bought the 14,260-square-foot full-floor penthouse for $17 million in 2014 and listed the unit for $30 million in September.The five-bedroom unit features floor-to-ceiling windows, a private access elevator and comes with four penthouse level parking spaces, according to Redfin’s listing.

They’ve moved out,” he added.“To have this much square footage on one floor with 20-foot ceilings is very unusual,” Chezi Rafaeli of Coldwell Banker told The Real Deal. Rafaeli represented both Shah and the buyer, whom he declined to identify. “This is the largest penthouse on a single floor in the Western hemisphere.”The buyer’s purchase price is the second-highest that anyone has paid for a single Chicago-area property.

Only one of his transactions was priced for more than $20 million, according to the publication.Chicago’s luxury residential market surged during the pandemic coupled with gains in the stock market and people’s demand for more space and privacy. More than 100 homes sold for more than $4 million last year, double the average of 51.5 over the past six years.Chicago’s luxury residential sales will continue their upward trend this year as people want to get in on the market with inflation creeping up along with a potential interest rate hike, Chezi said.“It’s [Chicago’s luxury residential market] basically reaching a similar level as the rest of the country because the rest of the country is doing really well,” he said. “If people are jumping into purchasing places, they’re making multiple bids.”[Chicago Tribune] – Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",401 N Wabash Avenue

The deal breaks down to around $57,000 per room.Seller Host Hotels & Resorts — a publicly traded real estate investment trust that bills itself as the largest lodging-focused REIT in the world with a market cap of $12 billion — valued Chicago Marriott Suites Downers Grove at $30 million in its 2021 annual report. Frontier CEO Evens Charles acknowledged the discounted price and said it presented a chance to buy low and increase the value over time.Charles said Frontier saw the sale as an opportunity to acquire the hotel at a good basis, particularly in a down market.The property is far from the first suburban Chicago hotel to sell at a discount, with several hoteliers cutting listing prices or taking a loss on their investment in recent months.Charles also said the acquisition fits the mold of his Washington-based firm’s strategy of driving value and expanding in certain submarkets. The group’s portfolio includes hospitality and multifamily investments in urban and secondary markets across six states.Host appears to be changing its strategy to focus on more markets with higher revenue per available room and exiting out of assets that don’t meet those targets, Charles said. Host, which is based in Bethesda, Md., didn’t return a request for comment.Hiren Desai, president and CEO of 3H, said the property complements other joint venture properties that his Tennessee-based firm has in the Chicago area.The acquisition marks Indianapolis-based Sun Development’s first joint venture with Frontier, chairman and CEO Bharat Patel said in a statement. The company operates 17 properties with more than 2,000 rooms across six states.Host put the DuPage County hotel on the market in 2019, along with the 256-room Chicago Marriott Suites O’Hare in Rosemont. The Rosemont hotel sold in 2019 for $39 million to investor Ketu Amin, still a far cry from the $60 million Host said it was worth at the time. Yet that marked a smaller gap in terms of the percentage drop between Host’s valuations and the sale price on the Downers Grove property.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

08:43 AM",A firm backed by Chicago Bulls and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf is setting its sights on the Near West Side.,"[""White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf and the property at the southeast corner of West Warren Boulevard and North Paulina Street in Chicago (Google Maps, Getty)A firm backed by Chicago Bulls and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf is setting its sights on the Near West Side.An LLC with ties to Michigan Avenue Real Estate Group’s leaders bought a vacant parcel for $5.5 million at the southeast corner of West Warren Boulevard and North Paulina Street, a person with knowledge of the deal said.The buyer also has ties to Reinsdorf’s longtime right-hand man — Howard Pizer. The duo’s connection dates all the way back to when Reinsdorf formed Balcor Co. in 1973, which he later sold to American Express in 1987.The property is within two blocks of the Bulls’ and Blackhawks’ home, the United Center. The lot was sold by a group of developers with Irish roots who bought it back in February for $3.5 million. The initial plan was to build a handful of homes that would have been expensive for the neighborhood, but not unreasonable for the Chicagoans who are being priced out of the nearby West Loop, where property values are swelling due to a wave of new apartment developments.The former owners were asking for around $250 per square foot on the half-acre site. It proved to be a tough sell at first with a rate that was much higher than other development properties in the neighborhood, according to 21 Century broker Steven Powers.The Reinsdorf-backed group clearly saw an opportunity and moved on it. It paid just $3 per square foot less than the owner’s initial asking price for the parcel.It borders another half-acre vacant parcel for sale along Madison Street. The price on that listing has not been disclosed. It is being marketed by Oxford Real Estate’s George Manos, who did not return a request for comment.“The sellers found a great development opportunity and were met with a much more intriguing flip opportunity,” Powers said. “It just goes to show the development that’s coming to the Near West Side.”It’s unclear what the buyer plans to do with the property or how much it could spend on an assemblage. Tom Meador, also a longtime Reinsdorf partner who led Michigan Avenue, did not return a request for comment.What is clear to Powers, however, is that whatever is developed on the property will be at a larger scale than the few homes his client intended to build there. That’s the only way the selling price makes economic sense, the broker suggested.Just to the east on the same block, Michigan Avenue developed the 52-unit Warren and Ashland apartments, which was completed in 2015, according to Yardi Matrix. In 2020, it expanded even farther west into Chicago’s bordering suburb of Oak Park. In that village’s downtown at 435 to 451 Madison Street, the firm’s project was scaled back at the request of neighbors and officials before gaining a required zoning variance to build 42 apartments, cut from the 48 it first sought for the site.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",21 Century broker St

Brookfield is planning a $250 million overhaul of Northbrook Court.Hi-Five Sports Zone is taking 14,000 square feet at mall at 1515 Lake Cook Road, taking over the former Sports Authority space after the big box store closed in 2016.Hi-Five Sports ZoneA Hi-Five spokesperson said the nearly 30-year-old sports program converted the former retail store into recreational space for basketball, football, baseball, floor hockey and soccer. The venue features a basketball court, turf field, event space and a lounge area for parents.As part of the renovations, Brookfield and developer Ryan Companies want to tear down the Macy’s store and replace it with 300 apartments, a grocery store, a food hall, new retail, a plaza for special events and more.The owner of the north suburban mall has asked the village to provide $21.5 million in tax increment financing for the project, and to rebate $5.5 million in sales taxes, according to the Northbrook Star.Changes at Northbrook Court have been in the works since January 2017, when then-owner GGP talked about renovating the mall to include fewer anchors and more non-traditional uses like the Hi-Five facility. Macy’s sold its space at the mall for $25 million in January 2018 to GGP, which was bought out by Brookfield in July for $15 billion.The Northbrook Court proposal follows a blueprint Brookfield laid out this year to repurpose poorly performing malls by adding housing, office space or hotels.Battered by diminishing revenue and rising vacancies — particularly after the demise of large tenants like Sports Authority, Toys “R” Us, Carson’s and potentially Sears — many mall owners nationwide are transforming their assets, turning the hulking properties into offices, housing, co-working spaces and hotels.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1515 Lake Cook Road

Its square footage wasn’t publicly listed. The private network deal didn’t have a public listing price. The home was built in 2018 by Dano Luxury and designed by New Space Architects, after the Knudsons paid $1.2 million for the lot in 2017, according to public records.The couple founded a learning software firm, NogginLabs, that was bought by Ernst & Young in 2018, and previously sold a Wilmette home built by Dano Luxury: the spec property at 214 Fifth Street. They bought that home in 2013 for $1.68 million before selling in 2018 for $1.85 million, and had previously bought a Sixth Street property for $849,000 in 2004 and sold it for more than $1.04 million in 2013, records show.Amenities at the Greenwood Road property include three front porches, a butler’s pantry, a 135-bottle wine cooler, and a 2.5-car garage addition that cost $30,000, according to the listing. All bedrooms include in-suite bathrooms, and the home has a balcony facing the backyard, an indoor pool, recreation room, a built-in full bar, home theater and home gym.The one-third-acre property is a few blocks from Lake Michigan.Frank Capitanini and Trish Capitanini with Coldwell Banker Realty represented the sellers, who have been parties in previous deals the agents have brokered. Sara Brahm with @properties Christie’s International Real Estate represented the buyers, who are not yet identified in public records.North Shore homes continue to sell for high prices this year, despite taking price cuts to change hands.The Knudsons sale is one of four in the affluent North Shore suburb to break $4 million this year, according to deals recorded by public listing sites. Another Wilmette home — whose price jumped thanks to a renovation — sold for $5.2 million just five days after hitting the market in August.That property, an 8,400-square-foot home at 1222 Chestnut Avenue in East Wilmette, closed on Aug. 5 for $5.18 million. It was listed for sale on June 6 for $5.5 million, and went under on June 11, public records show. Just two Wilmette homes hit the $4 million mark in 2021, a banner year for residential real estate, and three hit it in 2020.Also in August, a century-old lakefront Winnetka mansion sold for $12.75 million, though it was originally listed for 20 percent more at $16 million. At that seven-bedroom property on 645 Sheridan Road, the buyers plan to replace it with a new home. Built around 1902, it needed repairs and renovations, according to the buyer’s agent.In August, the former Winnetka home of Arthur Nielsen, founder of the A.C. Nielsen Company, sold for $6.8 million after four months on the market and down from the $6.9 million listing price.

(SVN Chicago Commercial, lgdevelopmentgroup.com)LG Development Group is adding nearly 200 more apartments to its proposed Fulton Market project and eliminating the office portion. The change comes as the pandemic continues to drive up office vacancy rates and follows a long-standing ban on most residential construction in the trendy district that was scrapped.LG now wants to build 665 units across two towers at 1143 and 1150 West Lake streets, according to SVN Chicago Commercial.The developer, which recently closed on the $32.2 million property sale, had planned to construct an 11-story office building and a 20-story tower with 479 apartments.Those initial plans, which included 5,000 square feet of ground-floor retail, was filed in July 2019, when the ban on most residential development in the district was still in force. It was lifted in May 2020, with the consent of Alderman Walter Burnett, who had previously opposed the move. He hoped the decision would spur development amid the city’s pandemic-crippled real estate market, Burnett said at the time.LG had agreed to a deal for the property two years ago at around the same price, contingent on winning city approval for the project.Sausage-maker ATK Foods owned the property, which includes a 52,000-square-foot building and a vacant parcel. It is one of the last remaining meatpacking sites in the district.SVN’s Drew Dillon and Scott Maesel represented ATK Foods in the sale.Developers have remained bullish on Fulton Market despite the pandemic; the area has been so popular that city officials are now considering whether to build a Metra station there.So far this year, a total of 40 commercial and residential development projects have either been proposed, approved or are in construction in the district, according to SVN.Maesel said he expects more residential developments, after having been restricted for over 20 years. “There were former meat packing facilities to protect and to not have residential projects conflict with them,” Maesel said, explaining the reason for the holdout. “There are only a handful of remaining meatpackers and it’s most likely going to be replaced with residential towers.”One of the most prolific developers in the city, Sterling Bay is planning a 282-unit, 29-story mixed-use tower at 160 North Morgan Street.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",160 North Morgan Street

Joe and Marion divorced in 1991, but he continued to live in the building and it was his known address when he was sentenced to prison in 2009. Prosecutors claimed the divorce was a way to hide assets. Lombardo died in a maximum-security prison in 2019 at the age of 90.The Ohio Street property with a two-car garage was listed for $800,000 in August but subsequent price cuts brought it down to $665,000 by the time Mike Galvin, the developer who bought the building, put it under contract last month.(Century 21 Affiliated)“We’re going to preserve the aesthetic of the interior,” said Galvin. The top-floor apartment has red flocked wallpaper, vertical red and white stripes on the walls of the foyer, and a black-and-white checkerboard hallway floor.The interior retains many design choices from the 1970s when Lombardo was one of the two men said to be running the Chicago crime syndicate’s business in Las Vegas.(Century 21 Affiliated)The home had been in Joe Lombardo’s extended family since at least 1925. Marion Lombardo and the couple’s daughter Joann are the owners of the building, according to the most recent public records, Crain’s reported. Joann Lombardo died in 2015. Fermin Perez, a Century 21 Affiliated agent, who represented the seller, said the building had been occupied by family only.Lombardo, who was arrested and acquitted 11 times by the age of 32, was given the nickname “The Clown” by the press because of his habit of making crazy faces in his mugshots. In the 1980s, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison after being convicted of bribing a US senator from Nevada, skimming $2 million from the proceeds of the Vegas casinos. Lombardo was convicted of multiple crimes including murdering a federal witness in 2007, 33 years after the crime actually took place. Lombardo, who died 10 years into a life sentence, proclaimed innocence in his letters in his final days.“I am Positively Not Guilty of all charges in the indictment,” Lombardo wrote, according to ABC7 Chicago reporter Chuck Goudie. “I rest my case Judge.”[Crain’s] – Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Completed in 1927, the hybrid Gothic and art deco building has views of a park and lakefront and houses apartments as well as vacant raw space.“With the prime location in Chicago’s East Loop adjacent to Millennium Park, there are endless possibilities for repositioning the assets assuming a successful zoning change,” CBRE said in an email marketing the property.The building is controlled by Chicago landlord Marc Realty, who owns apartments on the 13th through 21st floors that aren’t part of the sale, and Toronto-based businessman Xiao Hua “Edward” Gong, who owns the rest.Months after Gong purchased his portion for $20.8 million in a 2017 bankruptcy auction, authorities in Canada charged him with criminal securities fraud. Prosecutors froze his assets and obtained a restraining order, halting any redevelopment. The city also filed a lawsuit over the building’s deterioration and installed a receiver to oversee the property, leading to a court battle.Gong’s company ultimately pleaded guilty to operating a pyramid scheme in February 2021, after which Canadian prosecutors allowed him to reassume control of the building. The receiver, Courtney Jones, has filed a foreclosure suit, alleging $5 million in unpaid bills.A plan to develop part of the building into a hotel was scuttled after the City Council approved a zoning change in 2016 that effectively banned hotel uses for the property.[Crain’s] – Rachel HerzogAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",55 East Washington St

Accardo, said to have headed the Chicago Outfit syndicate, lived in the five-bedroom ranch for 15 years, among several homes in the neighborhood that included a 22-room home on Franklin Avenue.The 1963 home features distinctive white Roman brick and crab orchard stone walls. It was burglarized in 1977 while Accardo and his wife were on vacation. Shortly thereafter, five suspects turned up dead. No one was ever charged.The FBI searched the home in November 1978 after a longtime friend and house man for Accardo failed to show up at a federal grand jury session two months earlier. Agents found $250,000 in cash, a police scanner and a glass-enclosed gun case. Accardo sold the home in 1979 before moving to another River Forest home and then ultimately Barrington Hills. He died at 86 in 1992.It went into contract less than two weeks after being listed for $1.5 million in September. The most recent buyers paid $1.2 million in 2001.The 4,400-square-foot home has four full baths, two half baths, fireplaces, terrazzo floors and a decorative stone wall. It also has a finished basement with a 1,300-square-foot ballroom, a banquet kitchen and two-room guest suite. The home, which sits on more than a half acre, also has a wine cellar, a stone driveway, a basketball court and — and perhaps unsurprisingly, given its history, a perimeter fence.[CT] — Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1407 Ashland Avenue

Buck II in front of a rendering of the planned two-tower office building project at 655 West Madison Street (The John Buck Company, Juan Gabriel Moreno Architects, iStock)John Buck Co., one of Chicago’s top developers, decided that two is better than one when it comes to downtown towers.The plans to build a two-tower office building in the West Loop, rather than a single skyscraper, Crain’s reported. It’s a bet on the value of new office properties in a post-pandemic world where fewer large tenants are available to take up leases.The project, at 655 West Madison Street along the Kennedy Expressway, was originally meant to be a single, 1.5 million-square foot tower. Buck struck a deal with the property’s longtime owner to buy the site if the city approves a plan for redevelopment, and has had its eye on it since 2019, according to Crain’s. The site is one of the few remaining full-block surface parking lots in the West Loop.Buck made its name developing full-block skyscrapers in the city’s central business district and downtown. As companies cut back on workspace to cope with the popularity of remote work, the Buck will split the project in two and build one at a time. Downtown office vacancies are at record highs and many companies are trying to offload space amid rising interest rates that could make it more difficult to get financing for the project.CEO John Buck II estimated that he’ll need to pre-lease between 150,000 and 200,000 square feet to launch the first tower, down from the 500,000 square feet he would normally want to lease.“Our feeling is that the office is here to stay, but it is clear that virtually all users are going to reduce their footprints, and maybe in the neighborhood of 30 percent to 50 percent with remote working becoming en vogue,” Buck told the outlet. “But there will be a flight to quality.”[Crain’s] – Rachel HerzogAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",655 West Madison Street

After a decade-long court battle, a judge last week ruled the Forest Preserve District of Cook County can take ownership of the land, according to the Chicago Tribune.But the Cannons plan to appeal the rule, saying they have started growing just-legalized crop on the property ito help pay off the mortgage, according to the Tribune.The couple bought the farm in 2006 for $19 million, taking out a $14.5 million loan from Amcore Bank to finance the deal. But the couple later defaulted on the loan and the property entered foreclosure.The forest preserves bought the farm out of foreclosure for $14 million in 2013 and briefly opened it as public land. Legal challenges to the foreclosure proceedings, however, closed the land to public use and kept its future in question.Judge Margaret Ann Brennan last week ruled in favor of the forest preserves and blasted the Cannons for choosing to challenge the foreclosure rather than seeking to pay off their $14 million debt.

The buyers were Chicago aircraft leasing executives Brian Hollnagel and Victoria Ricks Hollnagel, according to Crain’s.Simpson bought the now-132-year-old house in 2011 for $5.3 million, according to Cook County records.

By mid-2017, the price was back down to $7.9 million.While the sale closed in June, the Hollnagels actually took ownership a year ago under a deal to delay the recording of the transfer of ownership with the county until last month.The Chicago area has seen a surge in pricey home sales this year. A stripped-to-the-wires penthouse at the Ritz-Carlton Residences on Michigan Avenue sold for $8 million in June, the seventh Chicago-area deal this year to reach that number.JDL Development’s 9 West Walton condo building has dominated the list of most expensive home sales recently, led by billionaire Ken Griffin’s record-shattering $59 million purchase of a four-story penthouse atop the building in April.Overall, Chicago lags far behind its big-city counterparts in terms of $1 million-plus home sales, standing 18th nationwide of the top 50 largest cities, according to a recent report.The mansion bought by the Hollnagels was rented by billionaire J.B.

Dakoff said in an email on Tuesday that Strategic Properties, whose CEO is Klor, has delayed the closing.“Unfortunately, the buyer has recently informed us that due to economic pressures, a portion of their funding has been impacted,” Dakoff said. “The board is currently working with the buyer to determine how this impacts the sale and negotiating acceptable terms for this delay.”Strategic Properties leadership didn’t return requests for comment.While Dakoff didn’t cite rising borrowing costs, rates were far more favorable last fall, when the critical threshold of condo unit owners cumulatively holding at least 85 percent of the property’s value voted to accept the offer after rejecting previous, less pricey proposals.Given today’s higher rates, “I’d be shocked if they close it at that number,” said Michael Dobrov, a real estate investor who has assembled a portfolio of thousands of apartments in the Chicago area through condo deconversions. He isn’t involved in the Ontario Street proposal.Such deals are sanctioned by a process laid out in state law that lets a buyer transform condo properties in which units are owned by individuals into rentals under one owner, as long as offers garner a supermajority of votes. They are somewhat unique to the Chicago area, due in part to the sluggish recovery of its condo market from the Great Recession and the strong performance of apartments. They are also often controversial, as they have the potential to strip ownership from unwilling sellers who get outvoted.Strategic Properties’ deal has been faced with litigation: a California federal judge has yet to decide on a motion to dismiss a complaint against the condo board brought by unit owners Gerald Glazer and Julius Cherry, who want to keep their condos and stop the deal from moving forward, Dakoff said. Earlier lawsuits they filed in Illinois courts were dismissed and Dakoff has said the California case lacks merit as well. It’s unclear whether the litigation played a role in stretching out the closing into a tighter economic environment for borrowers than when Strategic made its offer a year ago. The condo board had anticipated an early July closing.Cherry and Peter F. Samuel, a California lawyer representing Glazer and Cherry, who is the former fire chief of Sacramento, didn’t return requests for comment.Dakoff said Strategic Properties says it will work through the problem and noted its efficiency in completing condo deconversions in Chicago. The firm set a previous record for the city’s priciest deconversion when it bought 1400 Lake Shore Drive and turned it into apartments in 2019 for $107 million.“SPNA is adamant that that funding issue has nothing to do with the lawsuits and they are very confident this funding issue will be resolved,” Dakoff said. “They have closed on 100 percent of the deconversion deals they have done.”Nonetheless, the uncertainty has irked Ontario Place residents. A new closing date hasn’t been set.“Myself and many owners are frustrated not knowing what’s going on,” said one resident, Bill Martinez. “It’s a hell of a way to live.”Klor’s firm is also in the midst of closing a $96 million condo deconversion for a 310-unit Loop building at 200 North Dearborn Street that was accepted by the 85 percent threshold of unit owner voters this summer.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",10 East Ontario Street

In May of that year, he and his wife Seiko paid $4.55 million for the home and adjacent empty 0.2-acre parcel in the college town suburb. The full 0.55-acre property has 150 feet of frontage on Lake Michigan.Built in 1904, the Kedzie Street home has six bathrooms, two fireplaces and walls of large picture windows on the first floor. The kitchen, which is equipped with Sub-Zero, Wolf and Miele appliances, has an oversized counter island with quartzite waterfall countertops and opens into the family and dining rooms. The primary bedroom suite has a dressing area and a bathroom with 280-degree views surrounding a free-standing tub.The home also has a recently finished basement that has recreation and workout rooms.The exterior features a wraparound deck and the only deep-water dock in all of Evanston, which also features an adjoining patio.The house’s lot had a $52,721 property tax bill in 2020, while the adjoining parcel’s tax bill was $3.653 for the same year.While Darvish and the Padres look to topple the heavily-favored Dodgers, his agent will look to score him a profit on the sale.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",90 Kedzie St

Other tenants include defense contractor Northrop Grumman, which leases 42,000 square feet.Overall, the suburban office vacancy rate inched higher in the third quarter, after three previous quarters where it held steady or dropped. But there has also been a trend among firms of moving into the city to lure more employees.

Kiersey, Jr. (Dermody Properties, Getty)Glenview’s Allstate corporate campus is on the precipice of a total transformation now that its sale has been finalized.Reno, Nev.-based Dermody Properties completed the $232 million purchase of the 232-acre site at 2775 Sanders Road in the northern Chicago suburb, Crain’s reported. The industrial developer can begin construction on its first phase, which will include five warehouses totaling more than 1.2 million square feet that will open within a year.The first phase of the development also involves demolishing the building that served as the insurance company’s longtime headquarters. The project’s final form will see a 10-building, 3.2 million-square-foot logistics park.“This redevelopment project stands at the intersection of two significant and durable trends—work from home and e-commerce,” Dermody President Doug Kiersey said in a statement. He added that the conversion of the dated campus will be put to better use as an industrial park and create sustainable economic value for the community.After Allstate agreed to sell the property to Dermody about a year ago, the village of Glenview also agreed to an incentive package for the developer as the project stands to generate around $135 million in tax revenue.This project joins a record number of Chicago-area industrial developments currently underway. During the third quarter of 2022 some 37.5 million square feet of warehouse space was under construction in and around the Windy City, beating out the previous record of 30.1 million square feet in the second quarter of 2021, according to a Colliers report.Dermody is building the first pieces of the project on spec, similar to around 80 percent of similar projects currently under construction in the Chicago area, per Colliers.

The condo’s kitchen features trimmed marble, walnut and stainless steel, and its rooms are adorned with wood built-ins and paneling, per Crain’s. Residents enjoy restaurants, a spa, a fitness center and a bar that commands a view of Lake Michigan. Proximity to Michigan Avenue’s shopping and entertainment and the riverwalk are another perk residents can take advantage of.Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty agent Kelly Angelopoulos did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ivan Madera, a Jameson agent who represented the buyers, declined to comment, according to Crain’s, which noted that the buyers have not yet been identified in public records.Smisek became CEO of United in 2010 after he led negotiations to merge Continental Airlines, where he was chief executive officer, with United. In 2015, Smisek, along with two other United executives, stepped down amid a federal investigation into a favor-trading scheme between the airline and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that eventually saw former Port Authority chairman David Samson plead guilty to a felony conspiracy charge.Prices of condos at the Trump tower fell about 30% since it opened in 2009.

Hilco intends to build a massive warehouse on the site.Lightfoot also initiated an investigation into the city’s regulatory approval process and ordered the company, an affiliate of Hilco Global, to conduct a full cleanup and dust removal.Before the demolition, Hilco allegedly told city officials that the dust would be contained to the site. The company also said it would mail residents to inform them of the demolition, Alderman Michael Rodriguez told the Chicago Sun-Times. It didn’t happen, he said.“At this point, I wish I had communicated it to residents, and I did not. And for that I am very sorry,” Rodriguez said, according to the Sun-Times.Rodriguez said he’s concerned that the dust cloud will exacerbate the coronavirus situation.Hilco’s plan is to demolish the shuttered power plant and finish remediation of the 70-acre site. Afterward, it would construct what it claims would be the largest available warehouse space in Chicago, at about 1 million square feet. Hilco has branded the Chicago project “Exchange 55,” and said it will cost about $100 million.Hilco in 2017 spent $12 million to buy the plant, which was shut down in 2012 after years of pressure from environmentalists. The firm received a $20 million tax break on the project, and secured a $153 million construction loan from Pacific Coast Partners in July.Hilco has undertaken similar industrial projects in other cities, such as the former Bethlehem Steel plant in Baltimore, which is now leased to Amazon, FedEx and UnderArmour.In a statement issued late Sunday afternoon, Hilco’s CEO Roberto Perez said, “We are working cooperatively with the City of Chicago to review yesterday’s demolition event undertaken by our contractor. We are sensitive to the concerns of the community, and we will continue to work in full cooperation.” [Sun-Times] — James KleimannAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

One Central made a bid to incorporate a casino into the site as Chicago’s contest for the city’s first casino played out, and ultimately was passed over for Bally’s River West site. Derwinski has reiterated his support since the city’s casino selection.Plans for One Central call for 9,000 residential units and 11 million square feet of office and retail space to be built on a platform above the tracks that run along U.S. Highway 41. Dunn has also offered to pay to rebuild Metra’s century-old maintenance and switching yard at 18th Street.“Conceptually, we’re there,” Derwinski told the outlet. “But things need to be done. Details need to be resolved.”The project is still a long way from becoming a reality. Dunn isn’t starting discussions with the city about proposed zoning for the site until some time next year. He still has no commitment from the state to contribute $3.8 billion in financing needed for the transit center, at least until a feasibility study that’s in progress is finished.At the request of the Chicago Transit Authority, the American Public Transportation Association reviewed the project, which calls for a spur line off its Green Line that will pass near the Metra Electric tracks below the rest of the development.“As planned, the project could be GREAT,” APTA’s report read. “At this stage, however, many questions remain that should be answered in the next phase of work before CTA should fully commit to and take on the responsibility for a complex system extension.”APTA’s main concern is whether CTA and Pace will have the capacity to handle an additional 180,000 people boarding trains on the L system that would be generated by the project.— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The deal follows the recent trend of big office leasing companies snatching up smaller firms to expand their footprints.Transwestern is set to expand its Chicago portfolio substantially with the acquisition of MBRE, which oversees leasing in Michigan Plaza, 181 West Madison Street and 550 West Washington Boulevard. The properties will join those for which Transwestern already handles leasing, including 77 West Wacker Drive, 191 North Wacker Drive, The National at 125 South Clark Street and the NBC Tower.Similar acquisitions have been steadily made by other major real estate players for years, consolidating the business into the hands of brokerages geared to serve commercial building owners with large, global portfolios such as Chicago-based JLL and Cushman & Wakefield and Dallas-based CBRE. Transwestern is also one of the biggest providers of property management and commercial leasing services across the nation.MBRE formed by the 1998 merger of New York real estate investors Howard and Edward Milstein with Miglin-Beitler Management, a Chicago-based commercial real estate firm started by well-known real estate investors J. Paul Beitler and Lee Miglin, whose development firm built 181 West Madison.Developer John Murphy exited his role as MBRE president and vice chairman at the end of 2019. Shortly after, in October 2020, the firm’s managing principal, Peter Westmeyer, announced that the company was spinning off its health care division, which was renamed Remedy Medical Properties. That same month, the firm’s longest-serving executive, Kevin Purcell, vacated his post as president of leasing and management services after more than 20 years with the company to take a new role with Northbrook-based Hilco Global’s development branch.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",181 West Madison Street

12:31 PM",Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot raised the stakes on the city’s casino bidders.,"[""Alderman Brendan Reilly and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot with renderings of Rivers 78, Hard Rock One Central and Bally’s Chicago (42nd Ward, Getty, Related, Hard Rock Cafe International, Bally)Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot raised the stakes on the city’s casino bidders.The city is seeking $75 million from the winner selected from the three finalists, or a commitment to pay $40 million up front and $2 million a year later, Crain’s reported, citing unidentified people close to the matter.Hard Rock, Bally’s and Rush Gaming pitched the final three plans after Lightfoot’s office tossed out alternative proposals by Bally’s and Rush that would have placed a casino at or near the McCormick Place convention centers.Bally’s, which had already offered the city $25 million up front if it’s selected, is targeting the Tribune Publishing Center in River West. Rush is eyeing putting one of its Rivers-branded casinos at The 78 in the South Loop, while Hard Rock is looking at the proposed One Central development on the Near South Side.The mayor’s proposal to charge the winner tens of millions is the latest hurdle to overcome in the city’s yearslong plans for a casino Lightfoot says could generate city tax revenue of $200 million annually and relieve taxpayers from big police and fire pension obligations.Aldermen and residents in wards in or near the finalists’ sites have come out against a casino development in their back yards, and some officials have wondered whether they could revive the scrapped McCormick Place proposals.Alderman Tom Tunney, of the 44th Ward and chairman of the Chicago Casino Committee, is aiming for the final selection within the next month, and to seek approval from the Illinois Gaming Board by the fall, the Chicago Tribune reported.Community meetings for each of the three finalist sites yielded overwhelmingly negative comments.Alderman Brendan Reilly of the 42nd Ward, which includes River North, objects to the Bally’s Tribune proposal adjacent to his ward, which includes River North. He cited an April survey by the River North Residents Association that found 86 percent of almost 2,000 respondents were opposed to the casino, according to the Tribune.Reilly has also taken issue with news that the city only charged one $300,000 application fee to the Bally’s ownership group for both its proposals, including the dismissed one near the McCormick Place campus, while charging two distinct fees for the Rush Gaming Rivers proposals, one at each of the sites it eyed.Lightfoot’s administration said the application fees were handled differently because Bally’s ownership group for each of its casino sites would have been the same, while the Rivers brand was going to be used by separate owners for the casino components at The 78 development by Related Midwest and the tossed McCormick Place proposal by another owner.“We’re the only bidder that’s offering $25 million (to the city) upfront to build the project,” Bally’s CEO Soo Kim told the Tribune Friday. “We paid the fees that were asked. Don’t you think we would have sent another $300,000 if they asked us to?”Kim has also said he plans to eliminate an option within the casino contract to buy out minority investors; the city has required at least 25 percent minority investment in the casino. Bally’s is a few weeks away from releasing its revised minority investment program, which has $200 million in commitments from more than 200 investors, the Tribune reported.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

Sangamon Street was first reported in Crain’s.\nHazel will occupy the third and fourth floors of the 270,000-square-foot, 13-story building that Mark Goodman and Tishman completed earlier this year.With the new lease, Hazel will move its current staff of 35 people — it intends to double that number by year end — from its current location at the Illinois Institute of Technology tech park in Bronzeville.The deal with Hazel also reflects the recent leasing uptick in the trendy neighborhood whose office market — like the rest of the city — was hit hard by the pandemic, as companies exited leases or reduced their footprint.The improvement is good news for Tishman and Mark Goodman, which built 320 N. Sangamon on spec, showing their confidence in the neighborhood. Other Fulton Market developers have followed a similar path despite the glut of new product that has hit the market. The first tenant to ink a deal for space in the building was Tock,a restaurant reservation company that has leased 50,000 square feet, according to the report.Other companies moving into Fulton Market offices recently include Kimberly-Clark, Foxtrot Market, Jet Support Services, Calamos Investments and Tik Tok.[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",320 N Sangamon Street

Napolitano has been trying to block GlenStar’s plans since a similar project was proposed in 2017, arguing that his constituents were concerned about the stress on public resources that higher density housing would cause.Several other aldermen supported the project and said the need for affordable housing in the city outweighed Napolitano and his constituents’ concerns.“We need projects like this all over the city; we need to break precedent sometimes,” Maria Hadden, alderman for the 49th ward, said during the meeting. While the approval “breaks precedent and decorum in how the city has done things,” she said, “we do need to all work together to solve our bigger problems. We have an affordable housing crisis, we have a housing crisis in general, and we need to walk the walk as well as we talk the talk.”The four-year-long back-and-forth between GlenStar and the city on this project has been contentious. After the zoning committee rejected its initial proposal in 2017, GlenStar sued the city, claiming that the city council violated the developer’s right to due process. Before ultimately dropping the suit in 2019, GlenStar claimed that Napolitano was “stonewalling” the project because he didn’t want the lower-income units in his ward.After dropping the suit, GlenStar said it would try to build an office project on the site instead. However, the developer revisited the residential plan in May with hopes that the need for affordable housing in the city would win over many city leaders.Napolitano continued to argue against the project and said that the approval of something in someone else’s ward against their wishes was “a complete overstep of our office.”“Today it’s a commercial [property] that’s being forced into being changed into residential. Tomorrow may be residential to manufacturing in your ward,” Napolitano said at the meeting. “Today I’m sitting in the hot seat. And you may like me, you may hate me — but your decision will definitely reflect the precedent when you are sitting on the hot seat tomorrow. . . .You may be the next person that has to deal with it.”The latest decision from the city council comes at the same time as a federal inspection of aldermanic privilege in Chicago. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is investigating claims that the practice may be contributing to discrimination against low-income minorities.[CT] — Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",8535 West Higgins Road

But strong economic and market factors could give Chicago home sales a boost, said Anthony Chan, chief economist for Chase.After years of rebounding home prices, the national housing market has seen some stalling of late, as high prices and low inventory have deterred some buyers.But unlike some housing metro areas that have seen extreme highs and lows, Chicago’s market has remained even keeled, Chan said Tuesday at Chicago Agent’s Accelerate Summit 2019.“Prices didn’t drop as much in Chicago, but they’re not going up as much, either,” Chan said.“It’s a sign that the economy is somewhat steady. For people that don’t like a lot of risk and don’t like a lot of volatility, they like it.”Home prices are rising locally by about 3 percent year-over-year. That’s in contrast to other markets where prices are rising much more rapidly. Chicago’s home prices are still 15 percent below their pre-recession highs, while prices have already recovered to their pre-crash peaks in other markets, Chan said.The relatively slow home price growth combined with Chicago’s booming economy means this is still a strong market with good deals to be found, Chan said.“It’s not really hard to sell real estate when you tell people that Chicago has a vibrant economy, the economy continues to grow, you’ve got an unemployment rate below the national average, and yet you can still get a good deal on real estate,” Chan said.Despite the gloomy outlook for Chicago’s housing market, some positive factors have been recorded. Inventory is starting to rise. Millennials are starting to get into the market, and mortgage rates aren’t rising at the rate previously predicted, Chan said. Such factors could give the market a boost this year and beyond, he said.“This is not a bad time to start considering buying a house,” he said, speaking to a room of brokers. “It really gives you an opportunity to practice your craft and show people what they want.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

This year, they’re pushing hard to top that, backed by strong sales in the suburbs.“We are knocking on doors, I’ve never done that in my entire career,” she said.Chicago’s housing market was favorable for sellers last year, fueled by low interest rates and gains in the stock market, which often led to bidding wars. Coldwell Banker’s top agent expects the suburban housing market to continue to be a sellers’ market as inventory remains tight and demand is strong.While the suburban market will continue to be a bright spot, McKenna doesn’t expect the same for the city.“The city is a bigger place and there’s more to choose from,” McKenna said. Selling a property requires a strategy – repositioning the price, timing it right to put it on the market to create a sense of urgency, which is what her team does best, McKenna said.Read on for McKenna’s take on opportunities in this year’s housing market, her most expensive listing and areas with strong sales.This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.We have a real lack of inventory in the suburbs. I personally sold $33 million in seven deals this weekend in Hinsdale, which is the market I cover. In the city there’s more inventory to choose from and we’re not seeing as many multiple offers anymore.If something is priced well enough and that’s a fair value for the house, agents are putting them on the market. We do not do that. I think everything has to be pretty strategic. Last weekend, we had a property come on for $799,000 in Hinsdale. It’s very hard to find a property for that price in Winnetka or Hinsdale because they’re the closest to the city. We put it out on the market on a Thursday, and I had an open house on Saturday and Sunday. It was freezing this weekend but we had 172 people line out the door. I’ve known about that listing for four months. We got an offer and will close at the end of March.I think in the suburbs 100%. In Hinsdale, I had 113 listings last year and right now I have eight. We are knocking on doors, I’ve never done that in my entire career. We get one, we sell the next. However, there’s not much good inventory in the city. What I mean by that is if something’s listed in the city, and it’s a box checker, but if it’s still sitting on the market, it’s overpriced. People are not spending that. The city is a bigger place and there’s more to choose from.Our listings sell very quickly. For instance, we have a new listing at the Waldorf Astoria that was with a different agent for a long time. We took the time, which took four weeks to stage the whole thing, we repositioned the price, and now we’re going to put it on the market on Thursday. We’re not going to take any showings until Monday. So that allows the people to absorb what they see online. What we’ve seen is people need a sense of urgency. So what we are doing is we’re spending breakfast, lunch and dinner in these homes on that Monday, so that we can say yes to everybody that wants to come through, and it creates a multiple offer.It’s the house at 222 West Van Buren, Naperville listed for $14.9 million. The house itself has every amenity you’d ever want. A spa, pool, heated garage, heated floors and wine room. The cool thing about it is it owns a lot. The lot that it’s adjacent to could be commercial. So this is my first property that could be a commercial application or a residential application. If people are smart, they take the commercial application and offset the costs of what goes on there and they get the house for free.Lincoln Park, specifically, the single family home market has blown up. We’ve had top deals in that area selling 10 homes that were over $5 million in the past 12 months. Part of the reason why Lincoln Park wound up in the spot it did is because they don’t have the anchor stores like Gold Coast, which were hit these past two years with all of the violence that occurred in the city of Chicago. We’ve got several listings coming on in March, that probably might not even hit the market, because we can fill them from people leaving the suburbs. I have two coming on in very quiet streets, the finishes are there and both are on a lot and a half. There’s no supply within that category.There are a ton of hedge fund, tech people coming to Chicago. I place the top C suite people first. They never just come with one of them. There’s a plethora that join. So I’m very bullish on the Chicago market. There’s a ton coming from California, a ton coming from St. Louis, Kansas City, and a ton coming from New York. If you think about it, Chicago’s a very manageable New York. It’s the only city in the United States like it. From the city migration to the suburbs, it’s the usual suspects. It’s the husband and wife that have two plus kids that want to just get a little bit of peace and quiet and more space in their house. I also think it’s interesting to note, there are few really good rentals in the suburbs and the city right now. So people are being forced to buy. And they’re realizing that it’s actually cheaper because the interest rates are still low as that trend goes up. And as the supply increases, that’s going to be an interesting market.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The city council previously rejected a plan from Horizon for a 17-story building on the same site after a three-year effort for approval.Evanston’s downtown needs more development to support local businesses, said Horizon Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Michael, according to the RoundTable. The development would generate $1.5 million in revenue and would include 18 affordable units, an increase of about 20 percent to the downtown’s existing supply, he said.“The simple fact is Evanston needs more residents to support the business district,” he said. “And that’s what The Legacy is going to bring – more than 300 new residents living in the heart of Evanston’s business and shopping district , supporting the local economy every day.”Some community members have voiced opposition to the project, citing the building’s imposing size and local zoning laws that would prohibit it, according to a local condo owner.While the affordable housing aspect of the development “looks pretty strong,” according to Sue Loellbach, advocacy manager for Connections for the Homeless, she pushed for units to be marked down as much as possible.“I would love to see the affordability of those affordable units be as deep as possible,” she said.Horizon must file an application for a planned development which would initiate a public hearing process through several committees, the Round Table reported. The city council would then vote on final approval.[RoundTable] — Harrison ConneryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",31 Chicago Avenue

The requested loan would be 60 percent of the property’s total value, which the landlord estimates at $140 million.The document lists CVS Pharmacy among a group of companies that have already announced office leases in the 200,000-square-foot building: Google, construction company Leopardo, venture capital firm S2G Ventures and marketing firm Revolution.The five leases bring the building to about 94 percent occupied, according to the document.Representatives of Sterling Bay and JLL declined to comment on the lease. A spokesperson for CVS did not respond to requests for comment.Sterling Bay last secured financing on the property in August 2017, two months before construction got underway, getting a $60.8 million loan from the Union Labor Life Insurance Company, according to Cook County property records.If the CVS opens on the ground floor of the new building, it would be the only pharmacy operating inside Fulton Market. The building Sterling Bay completed last year at 1035 West Randolph Street, now the global headquarters for McDonald’s, has a Walgreens with no pharmacy.Another CVS Pharmacy already operates at 101 North Clinton Street, about a half mile east of the site.The building at 210 North Carpenter is the latest offering in a cluster of office buildings sprouting near the CTA Morgan station since Sterling Bay built new headquarters for McDonald’s and Google, part of an explosion of new workspaces drawing office demand west from the Loop.Shapack Partners and Focus Development are awaiting final permits to begin building a 17-story office building at 167 North Green Street, Murphy Development is preparing to build a smaller office building at 318 North Carpenter Street, and Tishman Speyer joined a bid by Mark Goodman & Associates to build about 225,000 square feet of office at 310 North Sangamon Street.Sterling Bay also is constructing a 19-story office tower at 333 North Green Street, the first of three planned buildings that would bring a combined 1.7 million square feet of new office space to the former Coyne College campus.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",210 North Carpenter Street

(Credit: Google Maps)The Chicago industrial market hit the brakes on new deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2019, after millions of square feet had come online earlier in the year. Construction, however, has not stopped.From October through December, 364,548 square feet of new supply was delivered in Cook County, compared to 1.5 million square feet over the same period in 2018, according to NAI Hiffman’s new fourth quarter industrial market report. Net absorption also cratered, to 310,000 square feet, from about 1.3 million at the end of 2018.But amid the 76 percent drop in new deliveries in Q4, total square footage for projects under construction increased. Five million square feet of new space was under construction, a 31-percent rise from the 3.8 million square feet in the works over the same period in 2018, NAI Hiffman reported.Chicago is still among the most dominant industrial markets in the country, and the lack of new supply led to a slightly lower vacancy rate for the fourth quarter of 2019: 4.72 percent compared to 4.76 percent in 2018.Likewise, there was 24.8 million square feet of vacant industrial space in Cook County from October through December, down slightly from 25.1 million square feet over the same period in 2018.The falloff in new deliveries was felt across the region last quarter. NAI Hiffman’s broader fourth quarter industrial report includes part of Illinois, southeast Wisconsin and northwest Indiana. In that three-state “Chicago area” region, it noted that more than 3 million square feet of industrial product was delivered in the last three months. That was down from the third quarter’s 7.3 million square feet of new space.Michael Flynn, NAI Hiffman chief operating officer, said when taking into account the tri-state region, he was optimistic about the year ahead.“I think it’s set up really strongly for 2020 based upon the velocity of deals being signed,” he said. Flynn added he expects to see more spec warehouse projects rather than build-to-suit.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The developer says a City Council committee has shelved the plan because the local alderman objects to its affordable housing component.GlenStar proposed the project at 8535 West Higgins Road in March 2017, and received a number of approvals. But plans halted when the Council’s zoning committee deferred a vote after Alderman Anthony Napolitano, who represents the 41st Ward, objected, according to Crain’s.In a lawsuit filed this week in Cook County Circuit Court, GlenStar claimed Napolitano initially gave his support to the project but did a flip-flop after another proposal for affordable housing in a neighboring ward came under fire from residents there. The suit said Napolitano opposes the project because of the affordable housing component. The zoning committee’s refusal to consider it for a vote effectively stops the project, according to the suit.With few exceptions, the Council typically defers to the local alderman’s wishes on development and zoning issues. Alderman Tom Tunney, who represents the 44th Ward, was the only member of the Plan Commission to vote against the GlenStar plan, citing Napolitano’s opposition to it.Napolitano has said the size of the project would put a strain on local schools and police and would lead to overcrowding. GlenStar called that opposition “contrived” in the lawsuit, according to Crain’s. Napolitano pulled his support of the project after the separate Jefferson Park affordable housing controversy “because he was concerned about the inclusion of affordable units in the proposed development,” the lawsuit said.Napolitano chief of staff Chris Vittorio told Crain’s that claim was “disingenuous” and meant “to put the alderman in a bad light and say he’s against affordable housing.”\xa0[Crain’s] — John O’BrienAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",8535 West Higgins Road

The second condo that was recently purchased is a four-bedroom, five-bathroom unit on the 67th floor that sold for a little more than $7 million.The latest pair of sales add to the growing list of units in the tower that have sold at multimillion dollar prices. Of the 393 units, the St. Regis has sold six for more than $6 million.

Some of the more expensive units available include the Sky 360 penthouses. The full-floor penthouse units begin on the 71st floor and offer 360-degree views of the Chicago skyline.The tower, which was designed by Jeanne Gang’s architecture firm Studio Gang, features such amenities as an outdoor pool, a fitness center, screening room, children’s activity room and a conference center.According to data from Crain’s, in an average year the city sells about 50 properties for $4 million or more — with the last property usually being sold at the end of the year. However, this year, Chicago has already seen 63 units sell for that price or higher. If luxury sales continue on this trajectory, 2021 could surpass 2018’s record 73 luxury units sold.Out of the top 10 sales for 2021, nine are located in the city — six of which are downtown condos — and the other property was a $7.7 million megamansion in the suburb of Hinsdale.[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","393 units, the St"

Bally’s wants to open a temporary casino at the landmark Medinah Temple by next summerThe board’s approval is a key step toward building the entertainment complex, which also needs a green light from the Plan Commision. Mayor Lori Lightfoot signed off on it, and the City Council voted 41 to 7 in May to approve an ordinance and community agreement for what would be Chicago’s first casino.The council’s vote came after a contentious debate about whether the project was moving too fast. One alderman recused himself and another wasn’t in attendance.Gaming regulators have been relatively slow with decisions, something the administrator, Marcus Fruchter, blames on pandemic delays and competitive bidding processes. It took more than two years from the time backers of Hard Rock Casino Rockford applied for approval for them to launch a temporary site.The Bally’s casino complex, which is slated to open some time in 2026, is expected to generate about $200 million annually that will go into underfunded police and firefighter pension funds.Bally’s made an upfront payment to the city of $40 million, which may have contributed to the gambling firm winning the bid over two other finalists.

Michael Drew (Credit: Structured Development)Structured Development won a key city OK to build 197 apartments and 150,000 square feet of retail and office space near the three-year-old New City complex it developed on the Near North Side.The Chicago Plan Commission on Thursday gave the Chicago-based firm the go-ahead for its $56 million proposal for The Shops at Big Deahl, a 3-acre complex set to be anchored by a Planet Granite climbing gym at the corner of Dayton Avenue and Blackhawk Street.Minutes later, the commission approved Structured Development’s proposal for a seven-story residential building on the 55,600-square-foot current site of the Menomenee Club, kitty-corner from the Shops at Big Deahl.The nonprofit club turned over its property at 1505 North Dayton Avenue to the developer in exchange for a new 50,000-square-foot facility to be built next door to the retail complex. Structured Development also donated to an endowment club for the fund, and plans to build a 18,000-square-foot park between the retail mall and the new club.The new residential building on the current club site will include one-bedroom, two-bedroom and duplex apartments ranging from 833 to 1,253 square feet. An amenity deck will include a “dog spa” and “dog run,” according to the developer’s presentation.Structured Development will include five affordable units and pay about $1.9 million into the city’s low-income housing trust fund, in accordance with the city’s 2015 affordability ordinance. The property falls inside the city’s Near North pilot zone, which mandates 20 percent affordable units, but it did not need to meet the higher mandate because an earlier version of the planned development was approved before the new rules went into effect.The developer plans to begin construction on the club next spring, aiming to complete the entire array of buildings by 2022.New City was built on the former grounds of the Cabrini-Green public housing community, which was demolished between 1995 and 2011. The new complex includes 199 apartments and 360,000 square feet of retail anchored by a Mariano’s grocery store and an ArcLight movie theater.Earlier this year, Bucksbaum Retail Management signed Strive Logistics to a 20,000-square-foot lease at New City.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1505 North Dayton Avenue

In 2014, Los Angeles-based Oaktree replaced USAA as partner in the property, and together with GlenStar took out a $160.8 million mortgage on it. The venture refinanced the debt in 2017 with a $177.7 million loan, according to Crain’s.The 44-story building serves as the cornerstone of the Financial District, where office landlords are bracing for an uncertain future with the looming departures of Bank of America, BMO Harris and Northern Trust. The three banks’ plans to leave their Financial District offices for newer downtown buildings by 2022 would leave 1.85 million square feet of office space in the area vacant.The older buildings in the Financial District will have to vie for tenants against new, amenity-rich towers in River North, the West Loop and elsewhere, and landlords likely will have to spend to upgrade and compete.The Board of Trade building is 21 percent vacant, well above the Downtown average of 13 percent, but was more than half empty when GlenStar bought it, according to Crain’s.HFF is marketing the building.

02:00 PM","The gig economy refers to hundreds of income-earning activities that allow workers to set their own hours, work for as long or as little as they choose, and function as independent contractors or freelancers as opposed to salaried employees. Prominent examples include people who work as drivers for Uber or Lyft, assemble IKEA furniture for TaskRabbit or offer rooms in their homes on Airbnb.","[""The two biggest sources of home-mortgage money in the country — investors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — are quietly working on ways to make qualifying for a home purchase easier for participants in the booming “gig” economy.The gig economy refers to hundreds of income-earning activities that allow workers to set their own hours, work for as long or as little as they choose, and function as independent contractors or freelancers as opposed to salaried employees. Prominent examples include people who work as drivers for Uber or Lyft, assemble IKEA furniture for TaskRabbit or offer rooms in their homes on Airbnb.Estimates vary, but anywhere from just under 20 percent to 30 percent or more of the U.S. workforce participates in some way in the gig economy. Last year, Intuit, which owns TurboTax, estimated that 34 percent of the workforce earned money in gig pursuits and projected that this could rise to 43 percent by 2020.But when it comes to buying a home, the challenge for these workers is to make their gig-sourced earnings count as income for mortgage-qualification purposes. Lenders typically look for stable and continuing income streams — two years of documented income plus reasonable prospects that those earnings will continue for another several years. Lenders also routinely obtain tax-return transcripts from the IRS to confirm an applicant’s self-reported income.By its very nature, gig income often doesn’t fit neatly into these boxes. It can be sporadic and variable, depending on how much time an individual is able to devote to the work. Gig earnings can be substantial — thousands of dollars a month — but if that money can’t qualify as “income” under existing mortgage-industry guidelines, it may not help in buying a home with a standard mortgage.“We’re seeing gig income becoming more and more prevalent, especially among the younger demographic — first time buyers who have embraced things like Uber and Airbnb as a means to make money,” John Meussner, executive loan officer for Mason-McDuffie Mortgage Corp. in San Ramon, California, told me.Yet those earnings may not qualify under current rules for conventional mortgages.Enter Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fannie recently surveyed 3,000 lending executives and found that gig income on applications is increasingly common, but 95 percent said it’s difficult under current guidelines to use these earnings to approve borrowers’ applications. Two out of every three lenders said better treatment of this income would either “significantly” or “somewhat” improve “access to credit” for many buyers.Fannie and Freddie are now actively pursuing projects that would do just that. The tricky part for both companies: Whatever solutions they develop must still produce high-quality loans with low risks of default at the end of the process, and ideally must be automatable — that is, borrower information could be entered into Fannie’s and Freddie’s electronic underwriting systems at the application stage.Freddie’s efforts come under its “borrower of the future” initiative. Terri Merlino, vice president and chief credit officer for single-family business, told me the company is studying automated solutions “outside the box” to validate income from different sources for self-employed and gig-economy earners. Neither Freddie nor Fannie was able to discuss details on what they’re considering, but Freddie confirmed its partnership with high-tech software company LoanBeam, which provides automated verifications of multiple income streams of self-employed and other borrowers.Meussner hopes that Fannie and Freddie take a more realistic perspective on gig earnings. “If someone is pulling income from Uber for only six months” — which won’t qualify under the two-years standard — “they may have been doing similar things for years beforehand” for a different company. “That should be [the] primary focus rather than the exact employer and position that generated the income.” After all, Meussner said, “if someone can make similar income over the course of years doing various things in various places [in the gig economy], it could be argued they’re more dependable than someone with a long history with a salaried position in a field that is being disrupted by tech, in which case the loss of a job would be devastating financially.”You can bet Fannie and Freddie are listening to recommendations like this.Bottom line: If you make money in the gig economy, be aware that your earnings may not be “income” for conventional mortgage purposes. But sometime soon, if pilot programs and research now underway at Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae are successful, they just might.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",

The four-building, 23-acre industrial and office complex is 96 percent leased with tenants including RCN of Chicago, multiple medical offices and other businesses such as IK Gymnastics.Hines, known for building downtown high rises, is part of a joint venture developing the 60-story Salesforce Tower at 333 West Wolf Point Plaza. The company broke ground on the 820-foot-tall tower in April last year after securing a $500 million-plus construction loan. Hines expects to complete construction at the end of next year. In the suburbs, the firm is building a 17-story, 250-unit high-end apartment building in Oak Brook at the former McDonald’s headquarters.[Bisnow] — Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2501 West Bradley Place

(Credit: LinkedIn; Mac Properties; Scott Olson/Getty Images)Covid-19 has brought nearly all residential eviction filings to a screeching halt in Chicago. In mid-March the Cook County Sheriff’s Office even stopped serving eviction orders after officers encountered a tenant who showed symptoms of the virus.But one of the few landlords still proceeding with evictions has been Mac Properties, the property management arm of Antheus Capital, which owns 5,000 units across the city.Mac has angered tenants in recent weeks by demanding they sign nondisclosure agreements before discussing rent-payment plans. Despite threats of a rent strike by tenants who say the pandemic has left them financially strapped, Mac — as with other landlords — has not granted rent forgiveness. Instead, it has outlined a policy that includes allowing residents to pursue “a path to lease termination” or to move into a cheaper unit.The company filed two eviction claims in recent weeks in addition to the nine it sent in March, court records show. The April evictions were for tenant “bad behavior,” and the March notices were for nonpayment.Of the April notices, Mac spokesman Peter Cassel said: “Each of the tenants has agreed to move out, but we’re filing the eviction nonetheless to ensure they do.” New Jersey-based Antheus did not respond to a call for comment.On April 23, Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed an executive order prohibiting any new residential eviction action unless a tenant poses a “direct threat to the health and safety of other tenants, an immediate and severe risk to property” or violates a building code or health ordinance. Cassel said the two eviction filings last month fell into those categories.Mac’s tough position toward tenants comes as Chicago landlords are collecting May rent payments and face their own potential crises with lenders. Most Chicago landlords were able to collect full rents for April, including Mac, whose collections were down less than 5 percent, Cassel said. That was despite threats of a rent strike.Chicago landlords have said they are expecting a larger share of missed or partial payments this month.But the eviction notices also come at a time when unemployment is rising and nonessential businesses remain closed through May under Pritzker’s stay-at-home order.Mark Swartz, executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Better Housing — a legal aid agency — said he knew of only eight evictions filed in Chicago last week. By comparison, there were more than 17,000 evictions filed for the month of April 2019, according to the Chicago Reader. Last month’s data was not available.Other than Mac, John Bartlett of the advocacy group Metropolitan Tenants Association said he was “not aware of any other landlords” having served eviction notices.“Schrödinger’s tenant”\nPeter Moller, a tenant at a Mac building and an economics major at the University of Chicago, is one of the tenants being evicted for nonpayment. As a result of the coronavirus, Moller said he “fell on hard times,” and believes Mac has been unsympathetic.But Cassel disagreed, saying Moller has a history of nonpayment along with other issues. “He’s like Schrödinger’s tenant,” Cassel said, likening Moller to the cat in the famous Austrian thought experiment. “He is living there without risk of being displaced, until the court reopens. We hope Mr. Moller pays his rent.”Because Mac manages so many apartments, tenants have been able to organize and gain some attention. Mac Tenants United — which formed in late March — is demanding their rent be canceled during the crisis, saying they will stop paying if it isn’t. The group joins a chorus of tenants across the country who are threatening strikes. In Kansas City, where Mac manages 22 Antheus apartment buildings, tenants are organizing to withhold rent, according to Tara Raghuveer, director of KC Tenants. The group is helping lead that effort.Perhaps hoping to avoid that kind of showdown in Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Thursday unveiled “Chicago Housing Solidarity Pledge,” signed by representatives of some of Chicago’s most prominent banks, and landlord and agent groups. Included in that list are Chicagoland Apartment Association, Chicago Association of Realtors, Bank of America, BMO Harris Bank, US Bank and Fifth Third Bank. Swartz of the Lawyers Committee was the only housing advocacy-affiliated group to sign on. The 17 signatories pledged to work with homeowners and renters to prevent displacement and foreclosure. But the well-publicized effort has been criticized by tenant groups for being insufficient and lacking enforcement power.Marisa Novara, Chicago’s housing commissioner, said at the pledge agreement announcement that “our hope and our belief is that we can make it through this crisis without a wave of evictions or foreclosures.” But the pledge could also confuse tenants who could mistake the suggested measures for expanded rights and protections, critics said.Asked how, specifically, the pledge would be enforced, a spokesperson for the mayor sent a recording of Thursday’s announcement.Swartz acknowledged it lacked teeth and could potentially mislead renters, as well as potentially slowing momentum for more concrete measures.“There isn’t really a mechanism to monitor whether [lenders and landlords] do what they agree to. It doesn’t really affect lots of folks — and there are all sorts of landlords in the city, many who will be experiencing financial distress themselves who, once these [eviction moratorium] orders expire, will want to file evictions on renters. It doesn’t do anything to stop that.”Mac Properties’ Cassel said the company would sign onto the voluntary agreement; it has not done so yet. He noted that the pledge would not mandate any specific changes to Mac’s current business practices.Write to Georgia Kromrei at [email\xa0protected]All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",
