Most know him as the New York governor who resigned in the wake of a prostitution scandal in 2008. But the 59-year-old — who has reinvented himself several times over — now runs the real estate firm his late father, Bernard, founded in the 1950s. Spitzer got his start in the public sector as a young lawyer in Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau’s office, where he prosecuted mob cases in the early 1990s. He was elected state attorney general in 1998 and soon earned a national reputation as the “Sheriff of Wall Street” as he went head to head with bigwigs like AIG’s Hank Greenberg, the New York Stock Exchange’s Richard Grasso and billionaire Ken Langone, a co-founder of Home Depot who said he hopes Spitzer’s “private hell is hotter than anybody else’s.” Spitzer became governor in 2007, and some speculated that he would eventually run for president. But his meteoric rise in politics was cut short in March 2008, when news broke that he had patronized a high-priced prostitution ring (his FBI code name was “Client No. 9”). Spitzer abruptly resigned from office two days later amid a scandal that became a tabloid sensation. He attempted a political comeback in 2013 with a failed run for New York City comptroller. Spitzer and his wife, Silda, divorced soon after, and as part of a $7.5 million settlement have agreed not to make any public statements about each other. The following year, he went to work for his father’s company, Spitzer Engineering, which he rebranded Spitzer Enterprises. The firm built iconic properties such as 200 Central Park South and 800 Fifth Avenue — the luxury apartment tower overlooking Central Park that Spitzer now calls home. In 2014 and 2015, he sold two properties his father had accumulated and got started on two projects of his own: a three-tower, 857-unit rental development on the Williamsburg waterfront in Brooklyn and a mixed-use project with Related Companies in Hudson Yards, which will have 1.4 million square feet of residential and office space. Spitzer Enterprises has about 15 employees and roughly 5 million square feet of assets, including projects under development."|1800|200 Central Park South and 800 Fifth Avenue Chicago, IL|Chicago, IL, USA|(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)|41.8781136|-87.6297982|0.0

The Princeton graduate much prefers “creator” or “innovator,” though “financier” or “ground-lease evangelist” might be more accurate. Sugarman’s firm, which he founded as a part of Starwood Capital Group in 1993 before taking it public five years later, has closed more than $40 billion in debt and net leasing deals. And in 2017, iStar launched Safehold — the first public company to focus exclusively on ground leases. That marks a significant shift in Sugarman’s business strategy. This past February, iStar announced plans to sell off nearly $500 million in assets over the next two years to help grow its ground-lease business. At the same time, Sugarman and his associates are tasked with transforming a 1.25-mile stretch of Asbury Park as the master developer for the city’s waterfront. Under the $1 billion-plus redevelopment plan, they plan to add more than 2,000 homes and 300 hotel rooms to the New Jersey beach town over the next decade.

The proposed 615-room hotel at 320 South Clinton Street last year ran afoul of Alderman Brendan Reilly, who called the design “God awful.” Crews did do initial foundation work in spring 2018, but nothing has happened since. Reilly now says he plans to find out why there’s been no progress.

The firm has since grown to 40 people across two offices, one around the corner from Hudson Yards and the other in Beijing. Steven Holl Architects has completed more than 60 projects in the U.S., China, Japan and other countries. Holl and his colleagues worked on the $41 million Hunters Point library, which opened in September — nearly a decade after it was designed. Their extension of the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., also opened last month, sporting “crinkle concrete” walls, a style of concrete design invented by the firm. The company now has seven projects under construction, eight in design and another nine awaiting approvals or financing. Much of Holl’s work in the U.S. has focused on museums, religious institutions, schools and other public spaces, though his firm has designed a few office towers in China. Holl is also a professor at Columbia University, where he has taught about the phenomenological side of architecture since 1981. The ceiling of his office is lined with boxes containing tens of thousands of his own watercolor paintings, a collection he adds to every day as he works out aspects of his designs."|2434|655 Sixth Avenue Chicago, IL|655 N 6th Ave, Maywood, IL 60153, USA|(41.8933839, -87.840336, 0.0)|41.8933839|-87.840336|0.0

The firm has since grown to 40 people across two offices, one around the corner from Hudson Yards and the other in Beijing. Steven Holl Architects has completed more than 60 projects in the U.S., China, Japan and other countries. Holl and his colleagues worked on the $41 million Hunters Point library, which opened in September — nearly a decade after it was designed. Their extension of the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., also opened last month, sporting “crinkle concrete” walls, a style of concrete design invented by the firm. The company now has seven projects under construction, eight in design and another nine awaiting approvals or financing. Much of Holl’s work in the U.S. has focused on museums, religious institutions, schools and other public spaces, though his firm has designed a few office towers in China. Holl is also a professor at Columbia University, where he has taught about the phenomenological side of architecture since 1981. The ceiling of his office is lined with boxes containing tens of thousands of his own watercolor paintings, a collection he adds to every day as he works out aspects of his designs."|2444|655 Sixth Avenue Chicago, IL|655 N 6th Ave, Maywood, IL 60153, USA|(41.8933839, -87.840336, 0.0)|41.8933839|-87.840336|0.0

That helps Hodari, 38, remain confident about prospects for the company he co-founded in 2012 even after last year’s sudden and dramatic downfall of co-working giant WeWork cast a pall over the entire sector. Hodari said his role has become progressively more outward-facing as Industrious has grown and changed its business model from leasing space to focusing on partnerships and management contracts. And the firm continues to expand — doubling in size annually for the last six years — now boasting locations at 215 Park Avenue South by Union Square and 594 Dean Street in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, plus recently opened spots at 31 Hudson Yards, 325 Hudson Street in Soho and 1411 Broadway by Bryant Park. It also has outposts in 46 other cities, including Miami, Los Angeles and Chicago. That growth has led to several partnerships, including one with Equinox that ultimately led Hodari to start working out for the first time since ninth grade, when a high school soccer coach’s vow never to let him on the field led him to quit sports and exercise for about 22 years. Hodari got married in New Orleans in January with a wedding that featured a karaoke contest, a scavenger hunt and a trivia contest, along with flamenco dancers and a Latin jazz band."|2020|215 Park Avenue Chicago, IL|N North Park Avenue, Chicago, IL, USA|(41.9106866, -87.636645, 0.0)|41.9106866|-87.636645|0.0

The investment firm manages more than $60 billion in assets, and Sternlicht is launching a public company focused on special acquisitions that will hold a $600 million IPO in May. Sternlicht is now on the hunt for discounted properties, including distressed hotels. The Brown University and Harvard Business School graduate got his start in real estate investment at JMB Realty. Sternlicht was laid off from the company in 1990, following the market’s collapse, and went on to launch Starwood the next year with his partner at the time, Robert Faith. In one of their first deals, they bought apartments from the Resolution Trust Corporation — which the federal government formed to hold and liquidate properties owned by failed savings and loans in the wake of the S&L crisis. Starwood, which is building its new headquarters in Miami Beach, now employs more than 4,000 people across 16 offices on three continents. Over the past three decades, the company has acquired and developed more than 150 million square feet of office, retail and industrial space, 300,000 hotel rooms and 180,000 multifamily units. Starwood has also invested about $7 billion in energy infrastructure and $230 million in oil and gas. While the company has largely withstood the pandemic so far, Starwood has had to furlough some of its hotel workers. Sternlicht told The Real Deal he’s optimistic the hospitality industry will rebound from the pandemic, but said he’s more skeptical about the future of retail and voiced his many frustrations with Amazon. In a wide-ranging Zoom interview from his home in South Florida, the billionaire CEO also talked about everything from his stance on restarting the economy and his relationship with Donald Trump to his father’s harrowing experience during World War II."|2020|60 billion in assets, and St Chicago, IL|Chicago, IL, USA|(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)|41.8781136|-87.6297982|0.0
