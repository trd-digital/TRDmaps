11:17 AM",Factory-made modular homes are coming to Chicago.,"[""7205 South Ridgeland Avenue (Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty)Factory-made modular homes are coming to Chicago.Developer Summer Qwest Holdings completed one modular home in South Shore with plans to build at least two more, Crain’s reported.“It’s faster to build [than conventional construction] and easily repeatable,” Summer Qwest’s Marcus Dailey said. “It’s an innovative way to bring new construction that people can afford into the community.”The modular houses are built in pieces in a factory and assembled onsite, which essentially cuts construction time in half. In addition to the shortened construction timeline, the pre-cut, standardized materials are cheaper for builders, meaning the homes can be offered to buyers at a lower price.The first completed modular home for Summer Qwest is a 1,620-square-foot, three-bedroom at 7205 South Ridgeland Avenue. The home is currently listed for $449,900 by Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty.Dailey plans to build two more modular houses on the remaining vacant lots at the corner of Ridgeland Avenue and 72nd Street, next to the completed home. The lots have been vacant for almost 20 years, public records show.While modular construction is often associated with cheaper homes, it’s also becoming more popular with luxury housing developers. A modular seven-bedroom home with a pool and pool house in Bridgehampton, New York sold for $4.7 million in 2020.Dailey is the first developer to use designs from Archer Heights-based Kinexx Modular Construction for market-rate homes. Kinexx’s designs have previously been used for affordable housing projects, including the Resurrection Project in Back of the Yards, where the homes are listed for $200,000. Kinexx is also working with Structured Development to build modular houses in East Garfield Park as part of two developers’ affordable housing requirements.Overall, Kinexx has delivered seven modular homes for affordable housing projects in the Chicago area. The East Garfield Park project, where four of the units are located, will have two more delivered this week and has a total order for 28 homes.[CCB] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",7205 South Ridgeland Avenue,Factory-made modular, homes are coming to Chicago.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/04/25/first-market-rate-modular-home-available-in-chicagos-south-shore/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Factory-made modular</a> homes are coming to Chicago.","7205 South Ridgeland Avenue Chicago, IL","7205 S Ridgeland Ave, Chicago, IL 60649, USA","(41.76402179999999, -87.58213049999999, 0.0)",41.76402179999999,-87.58213049999999,0.0,2022

The banking giant is looking at sites to relocate upwards of 1 million square feet downtown at a time when choice office space is widely available and developers are itching to build.In what could be a record-breaking lease deal, JPMorgan reportedly is looking at a number of sites in vacant buildings as well as at least four potential new developments in the Loop and Fulton Market, according to the Chicago Tribune. If it does relocate from its namesake tower in the heart of the Loop, it has to determine what to do with that 1.9-million-square-foot skyscraper.This isn’t the first time JPMorgan has scouted for sites, but it looks like it could actually make the move this time, the Tribune said. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has been outspoken about bringing workers back to the office, insisting that some departments work five days a week onsite.And he’s upped the ante in New York to do it with a new “universal design” headquarters at 270 Park Avenue that has a flexible reconfiguration. At the same time, he’s told shareholders he intends to “significantly reduce” the company’s office footprint.In Chicago, the bank owns and occupies much of the 60-story Chase Tower that is an imposing part of the city’s skyline. It opened in 1969 and has been updated a few times since, but it’s not the same as the shining new skyscrapers Bank of America is now in at 110 N. Wacker Drive or the BMO Tower under construction next to Union Station.Real estate observers told the Tribune that JPMorgan would not want to let its competitors look better than it does in new towers, suggesting a move was imminent. If not, Chase Tower is likely to get a huge overhaul, the report said.[Chicago Tribune] – Jennifer WatersAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",270 Park Avenue,"JPMorgan Chase is,"," well, on the chase again.

A spokesperson for Cappleman Tuesday morning declined comment on the latest development.But Hopkins called Sterling Bay’s decision to add the 300 additional affordable units “very persuasive” and predicted the project will win committee approval Thursday.Mayoral candidates Toni Preckwinkle and Lori Lightfoot, meanwhile, have joined those who want delay the approval process until one of them becomes mayor in May. But Hopkins said the project has been debated and revised since July, a process he said has “consumed” his time, and said there is no need to delay the project any longer.“If we’ve earned support, we’re entitled to a vote now,” he said, adding opponents have not offered any concrete reasons for a delay. “They’ve simply been saying ‘delay, delay, delay’ for no other reason than to delay.”In addition to the 600 onsite affordable units, Sterling Bay has promised to develop 300 more affordable units within three miles of the Lincoln Yards site and pay $39 million into a city fund designed to promote affordable housing citywide.Sterling Bay spokesperson Sarah Hamilton issued a statement saying the firm is committed to be inclusive, whether through diversity in hiring and contracting or through affordable housing efforts.“Chicago is our home and we are proud to double the amount of on-site affordable housing at Lincoln Yards as well as contribute additional units and funds to the city’s affordable housing supply,” she said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","600 onsite affordable units, St","UPDATE, March 5,"," 1:25: Sterling Bay plans to double the amount of affordable housing units in the proposed Lincoln Yards megadevelopment, a move Alderman Brian Hopkins (2nd) said will help win over opponents of the project.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/03/05/sterling-bay-to-double-affordable-housing-at-lincoln-yards-project/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">UPDATE, March 5,</a> 1:25: Sterling Bay plans to double the amount of affordable housing units in the proposed Lincoln Yards megadevelopment, a move Alderman Brian Hopkins (2nd) said will help win over opponents of the project.","600 onsite affordable units, St Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2019

J.B. Pritzker announced on Thursday that Ernst & Young Infrastructure Advisors will lead the effort to sell the center, which is costing the city and taxpayers $17 million a year. The state hopes to identify a potential developer in the spring and sell the 1.2-million-square-foot building in the second half of 2020, according to the Chicago Tribune.Those who are interested in purchasing the 34-year-old building will have to maintain the Clark/Lake CTA station operating in the building. They’d also have to work out the retail lease held by Winthrop Realty Trust, which doesn’t expire until 2034.Pritzker said the money generated by the sale would go toward closing the gap in the state’s underfunded pension system. Gov. Bruce Rauner pushed for the sale during his tenure, and predicted it would bring in $300 million.“The Thompson Center has outlived its useful life in its current state, requiring $17 million a year just to operatie – and it’s time to generate value for the taxpayers from selling the building,” Pritzker said.

The 80-acre site also plans to have a 17-story, 250-unit high-end apartment building by Texas developer Hines Interest. This will replace the 332,000-square-foot space McDonald’s used for office space.The company’s lease comes at a time when the city’s suburban office buildings have taken a hit from the pandemic as tenants are rethinking the future of work-from-home policies.“The timing for this property’s availability couldn’t have been better,” said Jeff Shay, JLL’s executive vice president who represented the owner of the building. “We’re seeing an influx of interest in suburban offices that provide employers with the tools and environment to offer employees a healthy work-life balance.”Suburban vacancy rate rose to 26.5 percent in the third quarter this year, according to JLL. The rate for the East-West Corridor suburban submarket which includes Oak Brook was slightly lower at 22.1 percent.The co-founder of John Paul Mitchell Systems, a conglomerate producing hair care products, John Paul DeJoria, bought the property for $40 million two years ago and rebranded the former McDonald’s campus as Oak Brook Reserve.

An agreement between Northbrook and California’s Panattoni Development dated May 24 shows that village officials authorized Class 6b classification for the property, a step that cuts the property tax assessment for certain qualifying industrial buildings.The agreement stipulates that Panattoni, which entered the Chicago market in 2000 and has a 544 million-square-foot development profile that spans North America and Europe, plans to invest at least $40 million to complete the project. Neither TA Realty nor Panattoni responded to requests from The Real Deal to confirm that they’re developing the property in tandem.The plans come as office vacancies in suburban Chicago climb to a record 27.1 percent, according to JLL. Brokers have embraced a shift from outdated offices that aren’t in prime locations, which is driving up the rate, to industrial uses. The Chicago area’s industrial market has had few vacancies and developers have only recently matched demand.The Northbrook tax incentive is intended to encourage industrial development and is offered for new industrial facilities, rehabilitation of existing industrial structures and reuse of abandoned buildings for industrial use, according to the Cook County assessor’s website.Panattoni intends to demolish the office building and construct a 447,583-square-foot industrial building, according to the public records. It will be customized for an eventual tenant once it’s been leased.According to the document, the property has been vacant and unused for more than two years except for about 30,000 square feet used by Walgreens.

It is the first Global Luxury sales office in Illinois.Rebranding the Gold Coast office under the Global Luxury banner will allow the brokerages to bolster its luxury services in a city that saw a record year for $4-million-plus homes sales in 2018, said Ayoub Rabah, president of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Chicago.“We’re really excited about the global luxury market,” Rabah said. “That’s why we decided to expand our presence in the luxury space. I believe it sets the standard for luxury, and it demonstrates our prominence in the industry.”About 80 agents will work out of the Gold Coast office, and the brokerage is looking to add more, said Doug Fox, branch manager for the office. He said the agents will look to capitalize on the growing residential market Downtown, where buildings like No. 9 Walton, Vista Tower and One Bennett Park are adding hundreds of luxury condominiums.“It’s raising the bar for the number of homes in that price point,” Fox said. “I think it’s a great opportunity.”While other parts of the residential market have had their struggles recently, the luxury market has been strong.At least 70 home sales of $4 million or more were recorded through the first 11 months of 2018. Half were recorded in Chicago, and 20 were recorded in Gold Coast’s No. 9 Walton alone.The number of homes selling at $1 million or higher was up 19 percent through the third quarter of 2018.In targeting the luxury market, the agents in the rebranded Coldwell Banker office will have to compete with one of their former colleagues: Jennifer Ames, one of the highest-performing residential brokers in the Chicago area, this week announced she left the brokerage to launch Chicago’s first outpost for German brokerage Engel & Volkers. Ames said her new venture will continue to target transactions averaging in the $1 million range.Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage, part of New Jersey-based NRT, operates 50 offices in the Chicago area.

BASK took a loss of about $150,000 on one of them, a 98-room Elgin Country Inn & Suites at 2270 Point Boulevard.That hotel was valued at $5.85 million, down from the $6 million BASK paid for it in 2019, said Marcus & Millichap broker Ebrahim Valliani, who represented the seller.“They came out with probably a slight loss, but that was a better play for them than doing the renovation and keeping it long term,” Valliani said. Hotel property values are “still making their way” back to pre-pandemic marks, he said.Sellers are increasingly willing to swallow small losses and slash listing prices of assets that have sat on the market. Chicago-area hotel sales rose in the past year, offering owners a window of opportunity to make a deal since volume still lags pre-pandemic norms, according to brokerages.In June, Rana Rehan Zaid’s investment firm, Schaumburg-based Prominence Hospitality,\xa0sold a 206-room Hyatt hotel in Rosemont, at 6350 River Road, for a loss, according to public records that reveal at least $4 million was paid as part of the deal. The hotel last sold in 2017, when Prominence bought it for $11 million. The company wanted to move on from the Hyatt because the brand was outside its focus on limited service hotels, it said when the property was listed.Prominence, which works with and shares an address with BASK, didn’t return a request for comment.The owner of a suburban Hyatt House-branded hotel with 134 rooms at 1251 American Lane in Schaumburg also cut its asking price this summer after marketing the asset for months, to $11.5 million from $13 million. The property, owned by Phoenix-based investor NewGen Worldwide, last fetched $10.5 million in 2018, public records show. It needs a renovation that would cost about $6 million, weighing on its value, Valliani said.“There is demand but it’s at different levels than it was pre-pandemic,” said Andrew Rubin, a Frontline Real Estate Partners broker who’s marketing the 155-room Aloft Hotel in suburban Bolingbrook. That property went into receivership after its owner, Virginia Beach-based LTD, stopped making loan payments on a $14.2 million mortgage that it received just prior to Covid.While the Aloft listing doesn’t include a price, Rubin said sellers making deals at this stage of the recovery tend to be motivated. The price cuts are “factoring in the adjusted risk and the state of the world right now,” he said.“There is still a long path for a lot of this stuff,” Rubin said. “A lot of these were hit hard and are going to have a difficult time recovering.”Distressed hotels are also roiling downtown Chicago. The Hotel Felix in River North is heading for the auction block after its owners, Oxford Capital Group and Gettys Group, defaulted on $70 million in debt tied to the property. Palmer House, the city’s second-largest hotel, was hit with a foreclosure judgment earlier this summer. In addition, the 610-room JW Marriott in the Loop was bought at auction after its Orlando-based owner, Estein USA, defaulted on a $204 million loan.In addition to the risk presented by Covid, there are fewer buyers chasing downtown’s larger, pricier hotels because of this year’s spike in borrowing costs, an effect of federal policymakers working to tamp down inflation.Investment sales in 2022 have valued Chicago-area hotel rooms at about $130,000 each through May, down from about $180,000 in 2019, according to a Marcus & Millichap report. After a surge that started this summer, average daily rates are up almost 25 percent compared with last year and may hit $151 by the end of the year — $5 more than the pre-pandemic average, the brokerage said in a report.While sellers are adjusting their pricing in order to make deals, there’s still money to be made. That’s especially true for assets outside Cook County, reflecting lower taxes and a relative lack of supply.“There are less buyers out there, but if things are priced appropriately, there is still capital out there,” Frontline’s Matt Tarshis said, adding his brokerage hasn’t experienced a slowdown in deal volume this year. Likewise, Valliani said his three-person team this year is on track to surpass its record number of closed hotel deals in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan set at 28 in 2019.The other two hotels that Valliani sold for BASK were the 86-room Holiday Inn Express in Algonquin, which fetched $6.9 million after last being sold for about $5 million in 2010 and renovated for an undisclosed cost. He also helped the firm sell a 78-room Comfort Suites, at 2480 Bushwood Drive in Elgin, for $6.45 million as part of the portfolio sale. BASK developed the property in 2006.Wisconsin-based investor Nilkanth Hotels bought the Comfort Suites and Holiday Inn Express, and a local investor bought the Country Inn and Suites in a 1031 exchange, Marcus & Millichap said. Attempts to reach the buyers for comment weren’t successful.Schaumburg, Elgin and Algonquin are all within Chicago’s northwest suburban submarket, which Marcus & Millichap called an area “where investors are ramping up activity, following an increase of more than 100 percent in hotelier revenues” from earlier in the pandemic.Valliani said his team persuaded BASK that it was getting a fair price, based on the recovery from Covid. These days, “you either sell and unload or hold onto them for another five to seven years.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misidentified the name of BASK and had an incorrect number for the loss in the second paragraph.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2270 Point Blvd and 1251 American Lane,"UPDATED, Aug. 10,"," 2022, 11:45 a.m: Suburban Chicago’s hoteliers are ready to move on from their properties, even when it means cutting a long-sought listing price or taking a loss on their investment.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/10/suburban-chicago-hoteliers-take-losses-cut-prices-for-deals/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">UPDATED, Aug. 10,</a> 2022, 11:45 a.m: Suburban Chicago’s hoteliers are ready to move on from their properties, even when it means cutting a long-sought listing price or taking a loss on their investment.","2270 Point Blvd and 1251 American Lane Chicago, IL","1251 American Ln, Schaumburg, IL 60173, USA","(42.0469308, -88.0491073, 0.0)",42.0469308,-88.0491073,0.0,2022

03:00 PM","As his massive compound in Chicago’s northern suburbs collects dust, Michael Jordan is now trying to part with another sprawling mansion.","[""Michael Jordan and an aerial view of his Highland Park property (Credit: Getty Images)As his massive compound in Chicago’s northern suburbs collects dust, Michael Jordan is now trying to part with another sprawling mansion.On Monday, His Airness listed a 10,000-square-foot mountain hideaway in the ritzy ski city of Park City, Utah. But the Park City home, for which he paid $7.9 million, already looks a good bet to sell before the Highland Park property he’s been trying to sell since Barack Obama’s first term in office.The mountain retreat, built in 2006, has five bedrooms and eight bathrooms, with waterfalls on the property and dramatic mountain views. It’s priced at $7.5 million — cheaper than some neighboring mansions — and, though luxurious, lacks the extreme personal touches that define Jordan’s gargantuan Illinois compound. You won’t find a “23” welded onto the front gate or multiple basketball courts on the premises. Judging by the listing photos, you wouldn’t even know it was his.It’s a very different story in Highland Park. The basketball great first listed the home in 2012 at $29 million, and has since slashed the price to $14.85 million. But even after four price drops, a failed auction and unsuccessful marketing tricks over the years, the property remains unsold and faces significant selling challenges, including a sagging suburban luxury market.(Credit: Zillow)One key reason the home has failed to sell is the intense level of customization, brokers said.“It’s clearly his home,” said Bruce Bowers of Bowers Realty Group. “It’s a tough sell. There’s a lot of work that would have to be done to make it your own.”Gail Lissner, a managing director at Integra Realty Resources, said that while she couldn’t opine on the value of the property, comps are limited, especially in the home’s immediate neighborhood. “Any time you have these homes that are just kind of gross over-improvements for the area they do lead to very, very lengthy marketing times,” she said. “It’s located in an area that is much more modest.”(Credit: Zillow)Homes at this price point are often situated along Lake Michigan — a couple miles from Jordan’s former home, she said. And there is not a robust market for such expensive properties in general. The home’s closest competition in Highland Park is a $9.75 million home on Crescent Court. It’s about a third of the size of the Jordan estate, sits directly on Lake Michigan and boasts a private beach. Bowers Realty Group reported the average median Highland Park for 2019 was $520,794 as of September. This is down from an estimated home price of $672,000 in 2018, according to Coldwell Banker.Jordan, who has an estimated net worth of almost $2 billion, moved into the Highland Park estate with his wife and three children in 1995, but said goodbye to the property after getting divorced in 2006. Compass’ Katherine Malkin, who has had the listing since 2012, declined to comment for this article.Jordan doesn’t have history on his side. Lissner said the MLS shows just one detached, single-family home that sold for more than $14 million in the Chicago metropolitan area since 2007: a Lake Bluff home listed at $25 million that sold for $16 million. When expanding that search for homes sold above $7.5 million, only 26 popped up.Other homes of similar sizes currently on the market vary in price. In Winnetka, a 27,000-square-foot home with six beds and 10 baths is listed at $9.5 million. It’s been on the market 175 days. A 30,000-square-foot, eight-bedroom, 14-bathroom Barrington home is listed at $18.88 million. It’s spent almost five years on the market.(Credit: Zillow)When homes sit on the market unmoved, like the Jordan property, a stigma sometimes develops around them, even if unfounded. “[Buyers ask] ‘Why has it been on the market for so long? What’s wrong with it?’,” Bowers said.Janet Borden of Coldwell Banker Homes suggested that at this point, the seller should be marketing to the brokerage community and looking to international buyers or targeted marketing towards sports enthusiasts using different social media and online tools.It’s a strategy that’s not too far off one used in 2015. That year, The Agency, a Los Angeles-based real estate brokerage firm focused on selling celebrity home, tried its luck selling Jordan compound. It offered a pair of each version of Air Jordan sneakers with the house and switched the listing price so that the numbers, when added up, reflected Jordan’s now-retired Bulls jersey number: 23. The gimmicks didn’t take, and it continued to languish on the market.Even with a unique property, the home must fit the local market, brokers said.“It’s pretty normal to have a longer than average market time on something like that because there aren’t that many buyers in the world that can buy it,” said Borden, who has toured the home. “The hard part is after a long, long period of market time, really what they should be looking at is price.”Lissner agreed. There is a buyer for every house — at the right price point, she said. What that price point is for Jordan’s home remains to be seen.Even without his Highland Park and Utah homes on the market, Jordan still has two properties where he can spend his time. He moved into his South Florida home after spending two years and $7.6 million dollars constructing a house on the three acres he bought for $4.8 million. The 28,000-square-foot, 11-bedroom house sits in the Bear’s Club community, an exclusive residential and golf club founded by golf great Jack Nicklaus. He also purchased a 12,000-square-foot, six-bedroom home in the Charlotte, North Carolina area in 2013 for $2.8 million. At that time, he had recently purchased the Charlotte Bobcats NBA team, now the Charlotte Hornets.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",75 million home on Crescent Court,As his massive," compound in Chicago’s northern suburbs collects dust, Michael Jordan is now trying to part with another sprawling mansion.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/10/17/michael-jordans-chicago-area-mansion-has-been-on-the-market-for-7-years-a-buyer-may-not-exist/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">As his massive</a> compound in Chicago’s northern suburbs collects dust, Michael Jordan is now trying to part with another sprawling mansion.","75 million home on Crescent Court Chicago, IL","Crescent Ct, Oak Lawn, IL 60453, USA","(41.7255939, -87.7819211, 0.0)",41.7255939,-87.7819211,0.0,2019

Fifty of the units will be marketed as affordable housing.The Habitat Co. and P3 Markets are developing the project on an empty corner at the intersection of Calumet Avenue and 43rd Street. The project received $5 million in Tax Increment Financing and low-income tax credits from the city.“Phase one will include 5,200 square feet for retail space and will bring new construction housing to a Chicago neighborhood booming with economic development,” P3 Markets’ Phillip Beckham told the Business Journal. “As a longtime resident of Bronzeville, this project is more than just another development. It is personal for me.”The first phase of development for the 10-story building is estimated to be completed by February 2023, with three more phases to follow.“Each phase will have housing and retail,” Jeff Head of the Affordable Housing Group for The Habitat Co. told the Business Journal. “A project like this deserves to be in a community like Bronzeville.”Further south, a 12-acre site at 11444 South Halsted Street is being developed into a mixed-use complex. The Morgan Park Commons will include 250 rental units, 140 single-family homes and up to 20,000 square feet of ground retail space.To the north, two buildings, designed by BKV Group, will replace a parking garage and a parking lot on South Wabash Avenue. In addition to 777 rental units and 314 hotel rooms, the new construction will also have about 42,000 square feet of commercial space on the first and second floors of the buildings.[CBJ] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",11444 South Halsted Street,A new development, may soon bring housing and retail to Chicago’s South Side.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/01/17/mixed-use-development-set-to-bring-housing-retail-to-bronzeville/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A new development</a> may soon bring housing and retail to Chicago’s South Side.","11444 South Halsted Street Chicago, IL","11444 S Halsted St, Chicago, IL 60628, USA","(41.6864094, -87.6440077, 0.0)",41.6864094,-87.6440077,0.0,2022

Some 31 percent of respondents to a national JLL survey this spring favored them over alternatives. That portion of respondents was the largest of those who indicated the senior housing assets they viewed with the best outlooks.Senior housing isn’t entirely recession-proof, though. Demand for such properties was softened by Covid-19, which dampened interest in congregate care facilities where the virus spread easily among high concentrations of hosts especially vulnerable to severe symptoms. Those concerns were less acute for active adult communities than senior communities offering more intensive health care regimens, and all asset types within the category have since started to rebound.“The pandemic turned this resilience on its head, but demand has since shown improvement on a quarterly basis, with occupancy continuing its steady climb back to pre-pandemic levels,” the JLL report said.Bender focuses on multifamily acquisitions between $5 million and $30 million of class B and C properties built 20 to 40 years ago that contain more than 100 units in the Midwest, according to the firm’s website. Burbank Manor, at 97 Pinehurst Court in suburban Burbank, consists of one- and two-bedroom units in 27 single-story buildings across six acres, and was built in 1983.The company last year stepped above its normal price range to pick up the 672-unit New Colonies apartment community in suburban Steger for almost $70 million.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",97 Pinehurst Court,Kurt Bender’s," multifamily investment firm Bender Companies spent $20.5 million on a suburban Chicago housing complex targeting older adults, an asset class increasingly desirable among apartment players.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/07/11/suburban-chicago-active-adult-complex-sells-for-40-premium-over-2021/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Kurt Bender’s</a> multifamily investment firm Bender Companies spent $20.5 million on a suburban Chicago housing complex targeting older adults, an asset class increasingly desirable among apartment players.","97 Pinehurst Court Chicago, IL","97 Pinehurst Ct., Burbank, IL 60459, USA","(41.7534689, -87.7669163, 0.0)",41.7534689,-87.7669163,0.0,2022

There’s no joke here — just the possibility of what could happen once Omer Asik, Todd Siwak and Ken Griffin all have moved in to their units in the still-under-construction high-rise from JDL Development at 9 West Walton Street in the Gold Coast. The 38-story building was scheduled to open later this year.The roster of soon-to-be residents at No. 9 Walton already includes hedge-fund managers, financial advisers, real estate execs, doctors, lawyers and other wealthy buyers who gave the building the record for most sales of $3 million or more, according to Crain’s.And while it’s true there are many Gold Coast buildings boasting well-heeled leaders of Chicago industry living in multimillion-dollar homes, No. 9 Walton has dominated the list of most expensive residential sales in recent months.In addition to the usual luxury amenities, the building also features a house car and driver, private wine storage available, a covered dog run and two guest suites available to all homeowners.

And even with the millions he’d have to spend to build out the home, it wouldn’t come close to the price tag of Griffin’s sprawling South Florida compound.Todd SiwakThe Ferrara Candy Company CEO paid $4.6 million for a three-bedroom unit on the 17th floor. Siwak has led the Oakbrook Terrace-based firm since 2013 and plans to use the condo as a second residence, according to the ChicagoTribune.

It refinanced the 1.75 million-square-foot office tower earlier this year with a $678 million loan from JPMorgan and Brookfield Asset Management.Company leaders predicted the additions could pull an additional 2 million tourists each year to the tower at 200 East Randolph Street. Downtown property managers are increasingly reaching for ways to capitalize on the city’s record-smashing tourism.In March, the Kemper Corporation moved its headquarters to the Aon Center with a 65,000-square-foot lease.

In 2006, the building converted to condo with a mix of studios and one-bedrooms, according to a press release.H.A. Langer & Associates already owns about 130 of the 250 units in the building, and is now looking to sell the whole building to a developer, according to Crain’s.Langer owned the entire building until 2005, when it sold the units to a condo converter.The firm then paid about $108,000 per unit when it bought 100 condos in the building in 2016. It has since acquired about 30 more units.Now the plan is to go full circle and sell the entire building to a developer.Kiser Group’s Lee Kiser, Michael DAgostino, Jake Parker and Ken Naslund will represent the building’s condo board in the search for a buyer. Kiser told Crain’s he expects the building to sell for about $40 million, which pencils out to $160,000 per unit.Condo deconversions have become increasingly common in some downtown neighborhoods and on the North Side in the last 15 years or so.Developers looking to address the market of those who don’t want to commit to a purchase — or can’t afford to buy a home — have actively been looking for more rental inventory.

He bought the building from New York-based The Family Office, which paid $18 million for the property in 2016 — meaning Rissman paid a 77 percent increase over the previous sale price.USAA Life Insurance Company provided a $21.5 million acquisition loan for the purchase, records show.Rissman founded Tiger Electronics, which produced the animatronic toy known as the Furby and keychain game known as Giga Pets, among other products. He sold the company to North Shore-based Hasbro for $335 million in 1998.Rissman went on to open Leo Capital Holdings, an investment firm whose office address is the same as the one listed on the LLC used to buy the Evanston office complex. Leo Capital Holdings makes early investments in private tech companies, according to its website. Rissman did not immediately return a call seeking comment.This isn’t Rissman’s first foray into real estate investment.Earlier this year, Rissman paid $43 million for the building at 200 North Green Street in Fulton Market, which is anchored by a 77,000-square-foot WeWork.He has invested heavily in the booming Near West Side neighborhoods, including paying $45 million for a six-story office building at 210 North Green Street in 2017 and buying a nine-story office building at 600 West Fulton Market for $32.2 million in 2007, according to Crain’s.In 2017, Rissman bought the office tower at 150 North Wacker Drive for $75 million, Crain’s reported at the time.The 10-story office building Rissman bought in Evanston was built in 1978 and underwent a renovation in 2006. The property also has a parking garage.Nearby, R2 Companies and T2 Investments are working to develop a 13-story office tower in Downtown Evanston.In November, Evanston voters approved a measure to raise the city’s real estate transfer tax of properties sales above $1.5 million.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",500 Davis Street,Toy tycoon and Furby, creator Randy Rissman bought an Evanston office building for $32.35 million.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/01/03/furby-creator-buys-evanston-office-tower-for-32m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Toy tycoon and Furby</a> creator Randy Rissman bought an Evanston office building for $32.35 million.","500 Davis Street Chicago, IL","Davis Center, 500 Davis St, Evanston, IL 60201, USA","(42.0456344, -87.6785943, 0.0)",42.0456344,-87.6785943,0.0,2019

Now its operator, Evanston-based nonprofit Connections for the Homeless, plans to hold at least a dozen meetings where those who live within a half-mile of the building can voice their concerns.While the shelter has supporters, some residents say people who stay there have been causing problems, including an increase in crime. Police who attended a Human Services Committee meeting in July said they’ve been called to the shelter on multiple occasions and once arrested a resident, who was removed and not allowed to return.Connections Executive Director Betty Bogg said many shelter residents who have gone through trauma and violence seek it out for support to find a permanent home. “The Margarita gives people a chance to catch their breath and organize their lives in a supportive environment and eventually move to a stable living arrangement,” she told the outlet.The group’s main goal is to buy the building. Its owner has more than $400,000 in unpaid taxes on it and needs to sell.John Cleave, 61, who lives three buildings away, told the publication that shelter residents loiter on the streets. Cleave also said some more serious incidents occurred, although he wasn’t comfortable going into detail.“We would like to see less problems,” Cleave told the outlet. “We want to make sure security is there and that the organization is doing its job: finding residents permanent housing.”— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1566 Oak Avenue,Residents and city, officials in the college suburb of Evanston are trying to decide the future of a hotel-turned-homeless shelter.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/09/evanston-debates-hotel-turned-homeless-shelter/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Residents and city</a> officials in the college suburb of Evanston are trying to decide the future of a hotel-turned-homeless shelter.","1566 Oak Avenue Chicago, IL","1566 W Oak St, Chicago, IL 60610, USA","(41.9005432, -87.6328817, 0.0)",41.9005432,-87.6328817,0.0,2022

Architecture firm Booth Hansen designed the project with plans to bring a new 5,000-square-foot worship space in addition to the condos.The condo units will be priced between $1 million to $2 million. Mark Ordower, the president of Ogden Partners, said the units could also become rentals depending on the financing options.The building is unique because despite being constructed in 1901 it does not have landmark status. The city can place landmark status on buildings without owner consent with the exception of buildings owned by religious organizations. So the congregation kept ownership to prevent the city from landmarking the site and making redevelopment plans more difficult.Groundbreaking is set to begin next spring.

The deal will raise an additional $300 million for Bally’s to develop the $1.74 billion casino project.“It’s just another step forward in making sure that the project is fully funded,” Bally’s chairman Soo Kim told the publication Monday.Earlier this month, Bally’s said it planned to sell the land and lease it back in an effort to raise money to build the new casino project. The 99-year ground lease with Oak Street has 10 options to renew the lease by 20 years each. The lease is expected to generate about 8.5 percent in annual capitalization for Oak Street.Bally’s CFO Bobby Lavan said the new partnership will provide more liquidity for the casino project without Bally’s having to borrow from other capital markets.Oak Street Capital specializes in sale-leasebacks and has more than $18 billion of assets under its management. Last year, New York-based Blue Owl Capital bought Oak Street for $950 million.Bally’s operates other casinos on land it has lease-back agreements for. The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Biloxi, MS, and Bally’s Tiverton Casino & Hotel in Rhode Island are some of Bally’s leaseback properties that will generate about $635 million for the company.Bally’s owns and manages 15 casinos across 10 states. The gaming company first moved into Illinois with its June 2021 purchase of Jumer’s Casino & Hotel in Rock Island for $120 million.

It transformed the school into 64 apartments that opened in 2018 with rents ranging between $1,655 a month for a 565-square-foot studio to $3,955 for a 1,745-square-foot three-bedroom.The property features vintage aspects from its days as a school, like arches and ornate ceiling details in the four apartments carved out of the former auditorium, blackboards on the walls of some apartments and numbered classroom doors in others.Morningside declined to comment on the sale.The deal implied a value of more than $363,000 per unit at the Stewart School Lofts, edging the $332,600 per unit implied by Chicago’s priciest multifamily sale so far this year at the 30-story Astoria Tower luxury apartment building in the South Loop.In that deal, a local investor, Rosemont-based 3L Real Estate, paid $67.5 million to Miami-based Crescent Heights for the building on the property while splitting the land from the rest of the real estate that valued the ground leasehold at $15 million, accounting for the full $82.5 million valuation.The buyer in the Stewart School deal was Stewart School Lofts LLC, an entity registered in Delaware whose owner could not be immediately identified. A Chicago attorney reached by The Real Deal who represented the buyer on the closing did not identify her client.The buyer financed its purchase with a $15.3 million mortgage, with Walker & Dunlop as the lender, public records show.Morningside still owns dozens of other multifamily assets, most of them in the Chicago area, with several in Michigan and Texas, as well.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","23 million, of the St",Chicago investment," firm Morningside USA profited on the sale, for $23 million, of the Stewart School Lofts apartments after buying the Uptown property in a controversial 2015 deal.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/04/29/chicago-investor-sells-former-uptown-school-converted-into-apartments-for-23m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Chicago investment</a> firm Morningside USA profited on the sale, for $23 million, of the Stewart School Lofts apartments after buying the Uptown property in a controversial 2015 deal.","23 million, of the St Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2022

The six-time NBA Champion chose the final asking price because the numbers add up to his uniform number of 23.While Jordan hasn’t budged on the price since 2015, Katherine Malkin of Compass told the Tribune that the property has been drawing interest recently.“I’m not sure if it’s because of the TV programs that they did or if it’s because people have an interest in looking at it a little bit differently, but suddenly there does appear to be a bit of interest in it,” she said.Netflix last year aired a documentary miniseries about Jordan and the 1990s Chicago Bulls called “The Last Dance,” which once again thrust His Airness into the public eye.Malkin said the contemporary style mansion, built at the height of Jordan’s fame in 1995, has struggled to sell in-part because the Hall of Famer doesn’t want to put on open houses due to privacy concerns.The seven-acre estate has 15 full bathrooms, four half-bathrooms, a basketball court, an infinity pool and a cigar room. The house has 56,000-square-feet of living space including the basement and 15-car garage.

Berkley, according to Crain’s. Also inking leases were Live Nation/Ticketmaster, Collins Engineers and electronic payment company Verifone.The new leasing activity signals a turnaround for a building that had performed poorly since 601W acquired it just before the recession.601W bought the 18-story, 407,000 square-foot building for $125 million in 2005, according to Crain’s. The firm refinanced the property with a $97.5 million loan in 2007, but the economic recession and slow leasing activity helped send the loan into receivership.Early last year, 601W took out a new, $87.7 million mortgage on the property, with plans for a $12.5 million renovation.With the new tenants, the building is now 85 percent leased, up from 61 percent in July, according to Crain’s.The building sits in an area of the Loop that’s seeing a resurgence of office leasing and development. That includes 601W’s overhaul of the massive Old Main Post Office nearby, and Blackstone’s $668 million upgrade of the Willis Tower.

He designed the hilltop home with an octagonal living room, interior columns that taper at the bottom, Arizona limestone floors and a long zigzagging glass wall.Lloyd Wright only designed two buildings in his home state of Illinois, making the house a piece of history. The other building he designed was the Good Shepherd Community Church. He and his son completed the church in 1961 and it was bought by Maine Township in 1983 to house the township’s offices.The Kropps sold the Grayslake home to animal trainer and philanthropist John Cuneo Jr. in the 1970s. Cuneo reportedly kept bison, peacocks and other animals on the property during his time there. He sold most of the land to the Lake County Forest Preserve District in 2016 for about $10.5 million.The home features an indoor gun range, interior and exterior waterfalls, as well as an attached greenhouse. There is also a detached five-car garage set above a 2-bedroom guest house.

Pritzker’s broader plan to sell off properties in the state’s real estate portfolio that are either too old or too expensive to maintain.It already unloaded a similar property when Google bought the James R. Thompson Center for $105 million earlier this summer. Officials said they estimate that sale will save taxpayers nearly $1 billion over 30 years.The Damen Silos, once used to mix road-construction materials for the Illinois Department of Transportation, was transferred to the Illinois’ Central Management Services in 2005 after officially being declared useless.Initial bids for the property are due by October 19, and must be at minimum $3.25 million.— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2900 South Damen Avenue,Illinois wants to, set a new stage for Chicago’s iconic Damen Avenue Silos.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/18/illinois-looking-to-unload-riverfront-silos-seen-in-transformers-film/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Illinois wants to</a> set a new stage for Chicago’s iconic Damen Avenue Silos.","2900 South Damen Avenue Chicago, IL","2900 S Damen Ave, Chicago, IL 60608, USA","(41.8409301, -87.6738896, 0.0)",41.8409301,-87.6738896,0.0,2022

The district, a state commission, is trying to attract more housing and retailers to give health care workers more options to live and shop nearby.An apartment building and hotel are being built near the intersection of Ogden and Damen Avenues, part of a long-stalled 1.2 million-square-foot mixed-use project known as the Gateway, and Naperville developer Marquette is building a 279-unit apartment building on Damen next to a 272-unit property it revamped and and reopened last year.Investors are targeting the area after Chicago developer John Murphy invested $140 million to transform the derelict former Cook County Hospital building into a 210-room hotel that opened in 2020, just south of Interstate 290 from the Rush office.The Canadian investment firm, which has a $10 billion portfolio of 224 properties across Canada, Brazil, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, also purchased four properties in suburban Chicago as part of its first acquisition package in the U.S.It paid $22.1 million for the Fox Valley Center for Health, a two-story, 46,000-square-foot building at 3310 West Main Street in St. Charles, while spending $22.4 million on a pair of adjacent medical properties at 2500 and 2580 West Fabyan Parkway in Batavia, a total of 39,800 interior square feet. It also picked up the 12,000-square-foot Salt Creek Surgery Center at 530 North Cass Avenue in suburban Westmont for $8.8 million.NorthWest’s U.S. portfolio includes properties across nine other states, including Indiana, Colorado, Texas and Arizona It consists of seven hospitals, five micro-hospitals and 15 medical office buildings, and is 97 percent occupied with average lease expirations of 10.7 years, the company said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1700 West Van Buren Street,A Canadian health, care real estate investor spent $120 million on five Chicago-area medical office buildings as part of its $602 million entrance to the U.S.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/04/29/canadian-reit-pays-120m-for-chicago-area-medical-offices-in-us-entry/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A Canadian health</a> care real estate investor spent $120 million on five Chicago-area medical office buildings as part of its $602 million entrance to the U.S.","1700 West Van Buren Street Chicago, IL","1700 W Van Buren St, Chicago, IL 60612, USA","(41.8765291, -87.6702538, 0.0)",41.8765291,-87.6702538,0.0,2022

Lake Street and a rendering of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel (Google Maps, Solomon Cordwell Buenz & Associate)A downtown Chicago site with a history of failed redevelopment efforts that included a Mandarin Oriental Hotel and a 50-story skyscraper finally has a new owner.Patrick Hotung, chief executive of Main Place Liberty Group, paid $31 million for the 40,600 square foot site at 130 E. Lake Street last month. Bordering the Buffalo, New York-based firm’s two Michigan Avenue office towers, Hotung said he will keep the site’s hole-in-the-ground status for now to keep his office tenants happy.It’s not the right time to think about new developments, Hotung said, referring to the city’s record vacancy rates and uncertainty about the resurgent coronavirus.“We really don’t have any plans at the moment,” he said. “But we control it now and I don’t have to worry about someone putting up a 100-story building 10 feet from our property lines.”The site’s saga goes back to the early 1980s, when developers proposed a three-tower office complex known then as Michigan Boulevard, a nod to Michigan Avenue’s original name, according to Mark Buth, an MBRE broker who has worked at the site for many years. The 25-story tower at 225 N. Michigan was built in 1982, and 205 N. Michigan, at 44 stories, was completed in 1986. Both are now Hotung’s properties and are called Michigan Plaza.A 50-story third tower was part of the design for the full block bounded by Michigan Avenue, Lake Street, South Water Street and Stetson Avenue. But the plans were scrapped after the stock market crash of 1988 and economic after-effects the following year. The site, which sits at the corner of Lake and Stetson streets, has been vacant ever since.The East Loop location is still considered a prime piece of property because of its easy access to Michigan Avenue, Lake Michigan and Grant Park as well as the Aon Center. The zoning is still in place to develop a massive office or residential tower if and when the market can bear it.Most Chicagoans remember it best as the site of the planned 74-story Mandarin Oriental hotel and luxury condominiums. Another economic downfall – the Great Recession – put the kibosh on that project and the developer’s major creditor, iStar Financial, started a messy foreclosure proceeding that took seven years to complete.In 2019, CA Ventures, the Chicago-based firm, known for its student housing and apartment developments, looked at redeveloping the site but never proceeded. Hotung bought the property from iStar, according to Cook County records.Hotung said his tenants became antsy every time a new development proposal popped up, fearing they would lose their views. However, he’s not totally ruling that out.“If we come up with a good idea or if someone else does and wants to partner, we’ll certainly entertain it,” said Hotung, who is part of the Hong Kong Ho Tung family real estate dynasty. “But right now is not a time to be putting up any new buildings, either residential or commercial with the COVID Delta.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",130 E.

11:41 AM",Who gets to keep the art?,"[""162 West Hubbard and 200 West Adams (Google Maps, iStock)Who gets to keep the art?That’s a question downtown Chicago’s commercial landlords and their new tenants need to hash out these days while negotiating deals, one that rarely came up before the pandemic emptied offices.With high vacancies in the central business district, record amounts of sublease space, and one of the nation’s hottest spots for new commercial development next door in the Fulton Market office district, downtown landlords are in a tough spot.They’re willing to offer more perqs than ever for tenants to land new leases or extensions, including upgraded furniture, computer equipment and even artwork for the office, said Tony Karmin, a Chicago broker representing tenants for Colliers International. He just negotiated a 20,000-square-foot lease on behalf of the consultant Axiom to double its footprint at 200 West Adams Street.“All bets are off in this market. There are no dumb questions, there’s no dumb requests, there is no request that’s too aggressive,” Karmin said.All the swag reflects just how tough it is for landlords to fill office space after vacancies in the Loop surged to almost 30 percent and remain high in major metro areas across the nation. In San Francisco, one office landlord is offering a Mexican vacation to brokers who just book property tours for clients, and similar incentives are on tap in Chicago for those who set up multiple viewings, said Steve Goldstein, a tenant rep broker for ChicagoBroker.com, an affiliate of Jameson Commercial.While rental rates came down only slightly during the pandemic, concession packages from downtown landlords have gotten sweeter for tenants. They’re more flexible than before the health crisis, especially in terms of how tenants can use buildout allowances, the amount of money landlords make available to tenants for interior construction or renovations.Landlords previously let just a portion of unused funds from a tenant’s buildout get credited as rent, and would only reimburse tenants for hard construction and moving costs, while furniture, equipment and other soft costs were shouldered by tenants. Those limits in many cases have been removed.“That’s a really big difference between today and what we’ve seen in the past,” Karmin said.The deal structure has set off a hunt for spaces tenants can use as they are, without having to put big bucks into changing the previous occupant’s interior finish.“Really, our value and what we’re doing today is the evaluation of existing condition space,” Karmin said of tenant reps.Construction allowances have grown to reflect rising costs of materials and labor amid the pandemic; Karmin puts the range between $80 and $120 a square foot, with upwards of $100 becoming more common. Tenants and their brokers are capitalizing on those offers by finding ways to avoid using funds on building costs so they can put them toward rent.“Where the real deals are is if a tenant can reutilize existing space,” Karmin said. “Especially in those situations where you don’t need all the dollars to go into the space, a tenant can completely update their furniture, completely update their technology.”Bargains in Loop buildings aren’t enough to stop the momentum in Fulton Market, though. The former meatpacking district was Chicago’s only pocket where availability dropped in 2021, and new construction proposals there keep coming. It’s far more expensive to rent in Fulton Market, yet tenants have shown a willingness to cough up cash to be in buildings with amenities like fitness centers and rooftop decks.“You still have pretty unreal demand. They’re clamoring to be in Fulton Market,” said Ari Klein, a broker for Cushman & Wakefield.He pointed to 167 Green Street in the Fulton Market district, which is fully leased after signing multiple tenants through the pandemic, including two leases across 89,000 square feet by White Claw maker Mark Anthony Brands and Lukas Walton’s philanthropy and investment firm, deals first reported by Crain’s.“Chicago is not like a coastal market. It’s not like New York or San Francisco where we get these super low vacancy numbers. Chicago gets to 9 or 10 percent vacancy and that’s when people start to build,” Klein said.With vacancy nowhere near that low in much of the city, though, landlords are willing to haggle with tenants for discounts used on the front end of leases. They’d rather do that than lower advertised rental rates paid throughout the life of a lease because lenders are more sensitive to reduced rents. Getting cash out of buildings through refinancing in a few years would be complicated much more by cutting face rents than offering bigger concession packages.“A landlord can’t do you a favor that’s going to ding its ultimate property value. They’ve been offering way more incentives on the abatement side. They want the commitments. Abatement is OK for today as long as they have cash flow for the future,” said Klein.Even Goldstein, of ChicagoBroker.com, got out of the landlord business this year, choosing to sell a River North office building he owned for more than a decade at 162 West Hubbard Street for $5.9 million in a deal recorded in January – the sale price exceeded the $1.9 million mortgage attached to the property in 2008 and another $2 million mortgage from 2018.“I thought I would never sell,” he said. He wanted to unload it before pouring capital into the property’s ventilation and other upgrades needed to make workers feel safe amid the pandemic. “The market has become so tenant friendly.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",200 West Adams Street,Who gets to keep the, art?,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/03/15/no-dumb-questions-chicago-office-tenants-buying-art-furniture-on-landlords-dime/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Who gets to keep the</a> art?","200 West Adams Street Chicago, IL","At&T Center, 200 W Adams St, Chicago, IL 60606, USA","(41.8797766, -87.63413899999999, 0.0)",41.8797766,-87.63413899999999,0.0,2022

(Redfin)Luxury buyers are still clamoring for properties in bucolic Lake Forest with two mansions selling this month for a combined $11.5 million.The pricier of the pair, a 9,100-square-foot estate, was purchased Tuesday for $6.2 million, according to Crain’s. It was the highest price paid for a home in the area in three years.The seller of the home at 980 N. Green Bay Road was Marshall Field V, retail heir and former owner of the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Daily News. He owned the property for decades, and first listed it in November for $6.75 million. It was designed by Howard Van Doren Shaw and sits on 15 acres.And earlier this month, Jeff and Chrystal Gannon unloaded their 10,600-square-foot Lake Forest mansion for $5.35 million, Crain’s reported. The closing price is a sharp drop from its January 2019 asking, when the property at 55 E. Onwentsia Road hit the market for $7.9 million. Designed by Phillip Liederbach of Liederbach & Graham, the property is on 3 acres.Overall, Chicago-area home sales have been on a months-long tear. Over 12,000 homes sold in April, a figure that even outpaced the area’s pre-pandemic April average. Housing supply is shrinking and median sales are up.\nIn 2020, Lake Forest saw the biggest percentage increase in home sales over 2019 of all Chicago-area suburbs. Lake Forest had 149 homes sold\xa0 — a 69 percent jump from the previous year.Despite the uptick, not all Lake Forest mansions are getting gobbled up. In late February, the former CEO of General Dynamics and his wife relisted their 13,000-square-foot home for $6.5 million.

Aldermen are up in arms and there’s even an allegation floating around that the mayor got bought off — for the chump-change sum of $6,000.None of that should come as a surprise for Bally’s, which like rivals in the gaming industry has had to put up with its share of political maneuvering ahead of last week’s decision by Mayor Lori Lightfoot.Yet the brouhaha that erupted over what is meant to be just a temporary gaming center while the real one is built underscores just how hard it is to push through major real estate projects — even when the mayor is on your side.Lightfoot chose the 130,000-square-foot Medinah Temple and former Bloomingdale’s store at 600 N. Wabash Ave. as the site for the temporary Bally’s location while the company develops its $1.7 billion casino project on the Chicago Tribune Publishing Center in River West.That was a detour from Bally’s original plan. The temporary casino site was initially at 700 West Chicago Avenue — a former Tribune advertising insertion plant that closed in 2012 — but was changed to the Wabash location at the urging of the city.The building, which is owned by Chicago developer Friedman Properties, has been vacant for more than two years. Opponents have raised concerns that Friedman Properties CEO Albert Friedman donated $6,000 to the mayor’s campaign fund on March 22, according to the Chicago Tribune. Friedman didn’t respond to a request for comment.Alderman Brendan Reilly, who represents the ward where the Medinah Temple casino would be located, called the idea “horrible,” during a hearing earlier this week. Reilly didn’t respond to a request for comment.The city is seeking an exception to allow liquor to be served inside the building, though the site is in a zone that prohibits additional liquor licenses. Deputy Mayor Samir Mayekar said granting an exception for the casino would be similar to exceptions for the city’s sports stadiums like Wrigley Field, and said it was needed to reduce vacancies.“No, that’s extraordinary,” Reilly said in the meeting. “The difference is this would be a brand-new casino in the middle of a mixed-use neighborhood downtown, whereas the stadiums … have been around for decades and in Wrigley’s case, a century, which long predates our liquor moratorium.”Perhaps the greatest unknowns are what will happen to the building once the permanent casino is completed and what the terms of Bally’s agreement with Friedman are. It’s unclear whether the temporary location could become a permanent casino at the end of the lease.Bally’s Chairman Soo Kim said Bally’s made inquiries about several sites city officials suggested, and the only one Bally’s could make a deal with was the Medinah Temple, though Kim was concerned about a lack of parking, according to the Chicago Tribune. Bally’s didn’t respond to a request for comment.The permanent site also has residents up in arms. At a town hall meeting on Thursday, everyone who spoke — a total of 80 community members — was in unanimous opposition to the River West site, according to Crain’s. Much of the criticism stems from how the massive entertainment complex will disturb those already living in the neighborhood.“You can see a pattern developing that the neighborhood does not want the casino,” Antonio Romanucci, a resident of River North, said at the meeting. “We are an older, established neighborhood community who have lived there for years and years to make it a neighborhood and now a casino is going to turn that upside down.”Should the casino get city approval, Bally’s plans to open it in 2023, and anticipates opening the permanent casino in 2026.Contact Miranda Davis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n The 78 developer Related Midwest goes dark after losing Chicago casino bid \n Chicago’s casino selection goes to Bally’s, and these real estate players win out \n Bally’s proposal for Chicago casino seen winning mayor’s approvalAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",600 N Wabash Avenue,One week after," winning a hard-fought campaign to develop Chicago’s first casino, Bally’s is learning that the city’s most-used nickname has less to do with Lake Michigan’s icy breeze than its bloviating politicians.

Bank of America will lease 500,000 square feet and Lincoln Financial will lease 60,000 square feet in the 1.53-million-square-foot office tower once it’s completed in 2020.In October, city officials approved Riverside’s $900 million proposal to redevelop Union Station, including building a new 55-story office tower next to the train hub.The developer also is adding its name to a 7-acre chunk of the Chicago River District project being planned by Tribune Media in the River West neighborhood.Downtown office rents have lagged so far this year, as older building owners are forced to compete with a growing wave of class-A office complexes cropping up Downtown.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",110 North Wacker Drive,Riverside Investment," & Development took out a $470 million loan on its 54-story office tower at 150 North Riverside Plaza, the second time the developer refinanced the property in just over a year.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/12/07/riverside-refinances-150-north-riverside-office-tower-with-470-loan/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Riverside Investment</a> & Development took out a $470 million loan on its 54-story office tower at 150 North Riverside Plaza, the second time the developer refinanced the property in just over a year.","110 North Wacker Drive Chicago, IL","110 N Upper Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL 60606, USA","(41.8834084, -87.637378, 0.0)",41.8834084,-87.637378,0.0,2018

The new five-story, 68-unit development will fill a parcel facing Lincoln and Damen avenues.The project will bring 68 residential units and 7,500 square feet of ground-floor retail to the city’s North Center area, just south of West Irving Park Road. The retail portion will have entrances on both Lincoln and Damen avenues. It’s being designed by SPACE Architects + Planners.To make the project more sustainable, the developer has approved a design that makes the building 10 percent more energy efficient than required by city code and 25 percent more efficient for stormwater drainage. Longford also plans incorporate measures that would reduce its water use by 25 percent compared to similar buildings designed to city code, and make half of the roof green with plantings.Seven of the residential units will be marketed as affordable housing for residents who make 30 percent of the area median income. Those units will be two- and three-bedroom floorplans. In addition, the project will also have a Divvy bike station on Damen where renters without cars will get a free one-year membership.General contractor Precision Excavating can now begin the demolition process to make way for new construction. When the project was first planned, construction was expected to begin in July 2022, but with the delay, the expected December 2023 completion date could be pushed back.Longford’s other projects underway include a 32-unit project in the Uptown neighborhood at 4453 North Hazel Street that’s slated for completion next year, as well as a 14-unit condo project at 4537 North Clark Street set for an April completion, its website shows.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",3914 N.

The return of Industrious to the neighborhood follows the exit of WeWork from the building, and the closure of the similarly sized Industrious space at 320 West Ohio Street in early 2021 after eight years.The Illinois Street building was bought by German Investor GLL for $75 million in 2015, and that company was bought by Macquarie in 2018.Salesforce is a longtime tenant of more than 100,000 square feet in the building, where it remains while waiting to expand into 500,000 square feet at its new namesake tower at Wolf Point. Construction on that property just topped off and is expected to be completed next year, which is also when the Salesforce lease was reported to be expiring.The decision by Industrious to beef up its Chicago-area presence with enough space for 350 seats comes on the heels of other coworking providers taking bullish stances on the city.WeWork just took 93,500 square feet in a Fulton Market building developed by Shapack Partners, the Swiss company International Workplace just expanded into its 49th Chicago-area location with a 10-year lease for 29,000 square feet at the new Bank of America tower, and Life Time Fitness just opened a 39,000-square-foot coworking space at its River North athletic club and will soon have more than 10 coworking options at or near its gyms across the country.Analysts have predicted flexible lease terms friendly to small businesses will be in high demand in the post-pandemic office market that so far has seen many companies shrink their leases. Such an environment would give a boost to coworking providers.“We’re happy to be back in River North,” Doug Feinberg of Industrious said in a statement that nodded to the neighborhood’s reputable nightlife. “Our latest River North location is perfect for members who prioritize work as much as they do play.”Industrious plans to have its newest coworking spot open by August.

Allstate said in October that it would sell the headquarters, its home for more than 50 years, as about 95 percent of employees in Northbrook choose to work from home.Dermody needs the green light from Glenview, Northbrook and Prospect Heights neighborhoods to move forward. Residents in other parts of Chicago have opposed warehouse developments, saying a slew of delivery trucks would add pollution and traffic congestion.Kiersey said his company will work with communities and that it plans to maintain a landscape buffer by planting trees and stormwater management ponds along Sanders Road and Interstate 294. He noted that infrastructure around the campus is already designed to handle thousands of employees and vendors each day at peak times.Dermody may contact Glenview or another suburb about its plans before it pushes forward with its development, the outlet reported.“We want to go where we’re wanted,” Kiersey told Crain’s.[Crain’s] — Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2775 Sanders Road,The Nevada, industrial developer that agreed to pay $232 million for Allstate’s suburban Chicago campus aims to transform the site into 3.2 million square feet of warehouses — assuming it gets the approval of local governments.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/11/30/buyer-of-allstate-campus-seeks-to-build-warehouses-on-site/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Nevada</a> industrial developer that agreed to pay $232 million for Allstate’s suburban Chicago campus aims to transform the site into 3.2 million square feet of warehouses — assuming it gets the approval of local governments.","2775 Sanders Road Chicago, IL","2775 Saunders Rd, Northbrook, IL 60062, USA","(42.1009833, -87.8704727, 0.0)",42.1009833,-87.8704727,0.0,2021

Built in 2005, it has been updated substantially since it was bought for $4.1 million in 2020, according to its Zillow listing.At the time of the 2020 sale, the agent for the buyers told Crain’s that they weren’t flippers and planned to live there for several years and renovate “over time.” It was listed, went under contract and sold in four days that May, during a Covid stay-home order.Timothy Salm and R. Matt Leutheuser of Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty represented the sellers. Salm didn’t respond to a request for comment. Information about the most recent buyer and the buyer’s agent weren’t disclosed.The property, just shy of a double lot and 49 feet by 125 feet in area, was the 80th Chicago metro home to sell for at least $4 million this year, reflecting ample appetite for the high end of the luxury market.

Lincoln Ave., according to Crain’s. The company took over the $73 million project from developer Norm Hassinger and Greenspire Capital, which had collaborated with Skokie officials on the development, and began work in May 2018, the outlet reported.The project, called the Lucien Lagrange, would have 14,300 square feet of retail and was expected to be completed in December 2019, according to its website. The village agreed to kick in $5 million in tax-increment financing.While foundation work has been done and the garage nearly finished, the construction loan was never obtained. With the coronavirus having seized up the U.S. economy, lending markets have clamped down and thousands of commercial real estate borrowers are now looking for help to make their monthly mortgage payments. Loan servicers are working with borrowers on existing loans and are scrutinizing the impact Covid-19 has had on their ability to pay, according to a recent TRD Talks Live panel that covered the current commercial mortgage brokerage industry.Murphy told Crain’s that lenders are cautious, asking for “a couple of months to breathe” to allow for the crisis to subside, but he is hopeful.\nMurphy is also in the middle of a $1 billion redevelopment of the long vacant Cook County Hospital in Chicago, where he will bring hotels, offices, and retail. Last year, Murphy also filed plans for an office building in Fulton Market that would include 96,000 square feet of office space and 10,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.

And the luxury market’s performance would be worse if not for the ultra-luxury market, which has been propped up by Downtown condo towers like No. 9 Walton.The suburbs, where Barrington Hill is located, meanwhile, logged a 13.5 percent year-over-year drop in the second quarter.But despite the challenging market, homeowners are not shying away from listing their luxury homes. And the average sales price of a luxury home — $1.3 million — was up 3 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, according to the RE/MAX report.In August, Chicago’s second biggest sale of the year — a North Shore Glencoe lakefront mansion — closed for $9.7 million.

Originally listed for $32 million, the property at 68 Locust Road went into contract on June 5, last priced at $9.5 million, the outlet reported.Sherwin Jarol, who is CEO of Chicago-based real estate firm SMB/Bradley, and his wife Deborah, tapped Landry Design Group to build the home, known as Le Grand Reve, after buying the site for $2.6 million. In 2011, the sellers told the Wall Street Journal that the house cost over $40 million to build. Landry is known for developing McMansion-style homes for celebrities in Los Angeles.It’s unclear who the buyer is for the property, called Le Grand Reve. The Jarols’ agent, @properties’ Jena Radnay, did not comment. But in January, she told the Chicago Tribune that she believed it was “underpriced” for the amount of work put into it and the quality of the build.“It’s the finest-built house in the Midwest,” Radnay said. “I have shown it many times in November and December. … Those that have a high level of knowledge of what things cost to construct know that [Le Grand Reve] is a phenomenal value.”The home, designed in a Mediterranean style, features a domed ceiling, double-stairs with iron railings, marble floors, a paved motor court with fountain, a swimming pool and spa, chef’s kitchen with a restaurant-style bar and a nine-car garage.The sale represents another disappointing mansion trade in Winnetka. In March, a 12,000-square-foot mansion in the town sold for $3.2 million, half of what the owner Robert F. Steel paid for it during the Great Recession.Those still on the hunt for an opulent mansion in the Chicago area still have a wealth of potential options. Among them are Michael Jordan’s Highland Park mansion, forever on the market for $14.9 million; the Parillo mansion in Lincoln Park that’s listed at $45 million, the highest price in the state; and the 30,000-square-foot Middle Easern-influenced mansion in Burr Ridge that was listed $6 million before it was removed from the market.

Leila Zammatta with Magellan Realty LLC represented the Magellan Development Group and Matt Mercer of Gold Coast Realty Chicago represented the buyer, who isn’t yet identified in public records.It was the 79th Chicago metro home to sell for at least $4 million this year, reflecting ample appetite for the high end of the luxury market. St. Regis units are selling briskly this year as more units are completed and the developer turns over the properties to owners. Those include three deals, one valued at $6 million and two at almost $9 million.One penthouse is already back on the market for $9.3 million, almost $1 million more than the owners paid in December for the 6,100-square-foot unit on the 78th floor with five bedrooms and five bathrooms. It doesn’t appear that the owners ever lived in the property, and it’s unclear why they’re selling after owning it for only about six months.The St. Regis Chicago, formerly the Wanda Vista Tower, is a 101-story tower completed in 2020. Located at 363 E Wacker Dr, it’s the city’s third-tallest building, and the highest designed by a female architect, Jeanne Gang, who heads Studio Gang Architects.The tower probably has several large deals closing in the coming months, given that the property’s agent has 14 units listed for sale on public listing sites. That includes two that are asking more than $10 million, one of which, at $18.5 million, would be among the priciest sales in Chicago this year should it close at that price.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",363 E Wacker Drive,Another condominium," at Chicago’s St. Regis, a 3,800-square-foot unit on the 58th floor with three bedrooms and three bathrooms, sold for more than $4 million.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/02/another-st-regis-sale-breaks-4-million/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Another condominium</a> at Chicago’s St. Regis, a 3,800-square-foot unit on the 58th floor with three bedrooms and three bathrooms, sold for more than $4 million.","363 E Wacker Drive Chicago, IL","363 E Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL 60601, USA","(41.8874508, -87.61745979999999, 0.0)",41.8874508,-87.61745979999999,0.0,2022

How much disposable income do people have? What does the entrepreneurship landscape look like?” Livability editor-in-chief Amanda Ellis told the outlet.A local realtor said Naperville deserves the notice, citing numerous restaurants, good school districts and easy access to public transportation and major roadways. “It’s a classy city with a great downtown that hosts mom-and-pop shops as well as some national brands,” Lee Ernst of eXp Realty told the publication.Livability singled out the suburb’s outdoor attractions including forest preserves, sports complexes, golf courses and the Naperville Riverwalk, as well as the “plethora of community get-togethers and festivals, like cute farmers markets and must-see concerts.”The ranking also factored in Naperville’s average commute of 33.6 minutes, median home value of $503,821, median household income of $127,648 and median property tax of $9,227.Madison has an average commute time of 19.3 minutes, a median home value of $378,228, a median household income of $67,565 and a median property tax of $5,426, according to Livability.Other Illinois cities that made Livability’s Top 100 are Oak Park at No. 28, Downers Grove at 37, Evanston at 52 and Bllomington at 64.– Rachel HerzogAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",100 Best Place,A Chicago suburb’s, blend of big-city amenities and small-town charm make it one of the nation’s best places to live.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/15/chicago-suburb-ranks-no-4-among-nations-most-livable-cities/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A Chicago suburb’s</a> blend of big-city amenities and small-town charm make it one of the nation’s best places to live.","100 Best Place Chicago, IL","E Best Dr, Chicago, IL 60637, USA","(41.7868274, -87.6114586, 0.0)",41.7868274,-87.6114586,0.0,2022

Jackson Boulevard, a person close to the deal told Crain’s that bids are expected at about $16 million, or about $140 per square foot. Stockbridge hired the Chicago office of Cushman & Wakefield for the sale.A Stockbridge venture paid $23.5 million for the eight-story property in 2017, when it was about half occupied and demand was strong for downtown office space. The company spent close to $8 million on upgrades and renovations, including almost $2 million to build move-in-ready office suites.The sale will test whether investors are still interested in brick-and-mortar office buildings amid the work-from-home shift during the pandemic. Many companies are seeking newer buildings with efficient air filtration systems, which could be a disadvantage for older properties like this one.Stockbridge sued one of the tenants in 2020 over unpaid rent. In the lawsuit, Stockbridge said New York-based Industrious abandoned its space and the $4 million it owes on a lease that runs through 2030. The suit is pending.The building’s largest tenant is coworking provider Workbox, which leases 14,000 square feet.[CCB] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",600 West Jackson Boulevard,San Francisco’s, Stockbridge Capital is set to take a loss on an office building it wants to unload in the West Loop.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/04/05/sf-based-stockbridge-to-unload-west-loop-office-building/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">San Francisco’s</a> Stockbridge Capital is set to take a loss on an office building it wants to unload in the West Loop.","600 West Jackson Boulevard Chicago, IL","600 W Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60661, USA","(41.8782728, -87.6428571, 0.0)",41.8782728,-87.6428571,0.0,2022

It’s unclear which agents represented the buyer and seller.The seller was a trust on behalf of the late Frederick Krehbiel, the former CEO of Molex, a Lisle-based electronic components company that his grandfather founded in 1938. Krehbiel died in 2021 at 80.Few details of the home are public because it was sold off market. Real estate sites put the home at seven bedrooms, 3.5 bathrooms and about 11,000 square feet. The home was built by Lemuel Freer at the turn of the 20th century, according to the Hinsdalean. Freer was the son of real estate developer L.C. Paine Freer. The home, which was designed by David Adler, originally had a third floor that included a ballroom and a boxing ring, but that floor was removed in 1934.Including this property, eight Hinsdale homes sold for at least $4 million in the past three years. A mansion there sold for $7.7 million last year, the priciest residential deal in the region and highest ever for the village, easily topping a previous high was $5.5 million.The buyer was an LLC created to hold the property; it’s unclear who is behind it. A lawyer associated with the LLC didn’t respond to a request for comment.Krehbiel was the nephew of legendary Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck and was born near Downers Grove, Illinois, according to an obituary by The Chicago Tribune. In 1965, Krehbiel joined Molex and established the company’s international division and later oversaw the company’s $7.1 billion sale to Koch Industries Inc. in 2013.After retiring, Krehbiel purchased Ballyfin, a 19th century estate in Ireland. He restored the 35,000-square-foot mansion, which is about 60 miles southwest of Dublin, and turned it into a hotel.Contact Miranda Davis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n Ex-Blackhawks player, TV analyst Konroyd asking $4M for home \n Hinsdale megamansion sale sets record \n Couple lists sprawling Hinsdale mansion for $6M.

It’s also the second-priciest in Winnetka for 2022, trailing a $16 million sale in July.James and Timmie Challenger paid $200,000 for the property in 1970, the equivalent of about $1.46 million today.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",645 Sheridan Rd,The buyers who, shelled out $12.75 million for a century-old lakefront mansion in Winnetka plan to tear it down and build a new home.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/16/lakefront-winnetka-mansion-to-be-demolished/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The buyers who</a> shelled out $12.75 million for a century-old lakefront mansion in Winnetka plan to tear it down and build a new home.","645 Sheridan Rd Chicago, IL","645 W Sheridan Rd, Chicago, IL 60613, USA","(41.95265450000001, -87.6464314, 0.0)",41.95265450000001,-87.6464314,0.0,2022

The vote faced fierce opposition because of Presence’s anti-abortion policy.Earlier this month, the Chicago Board of Ethics fined Burke $2,000 for presiding over the meeting despite having previously represented Presence through his private property tax appeal law firm.After AMITA Health acquired Presence and its 10 Chicago-area hospitals in December, it requested an extension for finalizing the TIF agreement, the Sun-Times reported. But this week, AMITA CEO Mark Frey announced his group “has decided not to complete the paperwork required to finalize the Presence Health TIF agreement,” with no further explanation.Fresh off his re-election victory in February, Burke is set next week to be sworn in for his 13th term in the City Council. But the alderman is still facing federal charges in an alleged extortion scheme, and he’s been tarnished by a trickle of smaller scandals in the interim.

The buyer is not yet identified in Cook County records.Nancy Tassone with Jameson Sotheby’s Int’l Realty was the listing agent, and said she was unable to comment on the deal. Julie Harron of Jameson Sotheby’s was the buyer’s agent and didn’t immediately return a request for comment.Griffin was poised to take a loss on the home even if it had sold at its full listing price. He bought it in 2014 for $13.3 million.It’s the first of four high-end Chicago condos to sell after Griffin put them on the market in the wake of his decision to move his family and company, the hedge fund and financial services firm Citadel, to Florida. He has already assembled a $1 billion real estate portfolio there, including Miami-Dade County’s most expensive residential purchase in history at $107 million.The other three are still active listings, according to Zillow.Those include an 8,000-square-foot full-floor condominium on the 66th floor of the Park Tower at 800 North Michigan Avenue for $13.25 million; a 9,250-square-foot full-floor condominium on the Park Tower’s 67th and top floor for $15.75 million; and a 7,085-square-foot unfinished condominium on the 35th floor of the building at 9 West Walton Street for $14 million.The Lincoln Park mansion that’s long been lived in by Griffin’s ex-wife, Anne Dias, also returned to the market this month for $9.5 million, a cut from a quiet $10 million sale recorded in Cook County records this summer.This week’s deal wasn’t the first sale Griffin’s made for more than $10 million in the Waldorf building. In 2014, he paid $16 million for a full-floor unit on the building’s 46th floor, and the next year sold it to billionaire Jude Reyes, the co-chairman of beer and food distributor Reyes Holdings, for the same price.Griffin still hasn’t listed his unfinished space on the top three floors in the building at 9 West Walton. He paid $58.75 million in four separate transactions for the 35th through 38th floors of the building in 2017. It’s unclear what his plans are for the space, but he never moved in or completed the units.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",11 E Walton Street,Ken Griffin’s sale," of his longtime Chicago home in the Waldorf Astoria building closed Friday for $10.2 million, an 11 percent discount from the asking price when it hit the market with a flurry of the billionaire’s other luxury condos in the city in July.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/10/14/ken-griffin-gets-haircut-on-waldorf-astoria-condo/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Ken Griffin’s sale</a> of his longtime Chicago home in the Waldorf Astoria building closed Friday for $10.2 million, an 11 percent discount from the asking price when it hit the market with a flurry of the billionaire’s other luxury condos in the city in July.","11 E Walton Street Chicago, IL","11 E Walton St, Chicago, IL 60611, USA","(41.899701, -87.6276042, 0.0)",41.899701,-87.6276042,0.0,2022

It’s the latest addition to the plaza, which has been going through major renovations.The store, which will be open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week, is expected to open this fall, according to the village. In addition to groceries, the store will also offer made-to-order foods such as sandwiches and pizzas.The store will have technology that allows customers to scan QR codes and pay for groceries in the Amazon app, skipping a line for the cashier. Customers will have to scan their code or card to open a gate in the store and leave.The Tinley Park Village Board also recently approved a liquor license that will allow the store to sell beer, wine and spirits.Amazon has multiple Fresh Stores across the area, including in Bloomingdale, Naperville and Schaumburg. The company opened its first Fresh Store in August 2020 and used its Just Walk Out technology in a store in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, Washington.The grocery store market is prospering in Chicago, where two properties sold for a combined $70 million at the end of June.

Those jobs, which will include positions in web services, retail and advertising, will add to the more than 1,000 workers currently based in Amazon’s Loop office.The latest deal is the third time Amazon has expanded its office footprint since moving into the building in 2016.Amazon currently has 250 job openings in its Chicago office. The company is hiring for multiple roles including data engineers, business development managers, financial analysts and user-experience researchers. Amazon’s new office space will be available to employees beginning in late 2022.“Amazon’s continued growth and expansion in Chicago is testament to the city’s strengths in distribution and transportation, our direct connectivity across the world, diverse workforce and network of academic institutions training the workforce of tomorrow,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement.The Tishman-Speyer-owned Adams Street building was about 77 percent leased before Amazon’s most recent expansion. Combined, the Adams Street and Monroe Street buildings, which are known as the Franklin, are almost 86 percent leased including Amazon’s new space.Amazon has built multiple distribution centers and delivery stations throughout the Chicago area in neighborhoods like Pullman, Gage Park and Humboldt Park and hired more than 15,000 people as a result.

The mall has been in operation for 20 years, according to the newspaper.The business owners formed a corporation and will be allowed to remain in the mall while they work out a deal, according to the Courier-News.Mario Farfan, executive director of the NorthWest Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, learned over the weekend that the mall would close, according to a post from the group’s Facebook page. More than 100 vendors had been given notices to move out by the end of August, the group said.The chamber said the vendors are marking progress toward a contract to extend their leases in the mall for nine months. The group said that they and the Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce are working with the vendors to help them find space.This isn’t the first time a suburban Chicago shopping center owner has been at odds with the local community.

Cottage Grove Avenue and Bright Star Church is at 735 E. 44th Street (Live At 4400 Grove, Google Maps)Chicago’s Bronzeville neighborhood may be getting some more affordable housing near the site of the 4400 Grove development completed in 2020.The Michaels Organization is teaming with suburban Northbrook-based Brinshore Development on a $38 million proposal to build 71 units across a complex of eight buildings between East 44th and 45th streets and South Cottage Grove and South Evans avenues, according to plans filed to Chicago officials.It would be the latest instance of multifamily developers targeting the city’s neighborhood dubbed its “Black Metropolis,” where interest in real estate was fierce in 2021. Some of that was fueled by last year’s approval of the $3.8 billion Bronzeville Lakefront megaproject that will include 4,800 dwellings, hotels and a life sciences center planned across 100 acres with completion planned in 2041.The median price of a home sold in Bronzeville last year through November hit $550,000, well above the $318,000 citywide average for the same period, according to The Real Deal, and more newly built homes, 28, sold in Bronzeville than in any other Chicago neighborhood in 2021. Developers have focused on the neighborhood, where vacant lots number in the thousands after a period of years with little investment activity in the area.If approved, the new project would bring 51 units reserved for people making between 30 and 60 percent of the area median income, or $44,760 for a two-person household. The other 20 units would be priced at market rates.The business partners have joined on housing development throughout Chicago that has brought 1,500 units to the city over the past 20 years, said Andrea Keeney, vice president of development at The Michaels Organization. That includes the 4400 Grove site that opened in 2020 adjacent to the recently proposed project.The mixed-use development, on the site of the Chicago Housing Authority’s former Washington Park Homes demolished in 2002, brought 18,000 square feet of retail and commercial space fronting South Cottage Grove Avenue that is now fully leased by businesses such as a wine store, a salon and an aquarium store, Keeney said. It also included 84 apartments, 38 of them being restricted to people making 60% or less of the area median income, and 21 of them being public housing.“At this point, we’re starting to have tenants move in and operate in those [commercial] spaces,” she said. “That was the emphasis of the first phase, to select local retailers to bring much-needed amenities to the community.”She described the 71-unit proposal on the table now as the “second phase” of the 4400 Grove project, which cost about $38 million to build and will consist of entirely residential space. The estimated cost of the next phase is also $38 million so far, Keeney said.It will replace the Bright Star Church building on the development site, and the religious organization will be given access to community space within the new development, Keeney said.The developers have applied for tax credit financing from the Illinois Housing Development Authority to move the project forward, and will know in May whether it is selected for funding, Keeney said. She hopes construction on the project could start in 2023.The unit mix consists of 24 one-bedrooms, 29 three-bedrooms, and 18 three-bedrooms, she said.“There is a need for this type of housing, especially in the Bronzeville community. We think this mix is going to be really successful,” Keeney said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",4400 Grove at 4424 S.

The project, expected to break ground in 2022, will feature a direct entrance for each unit from the elevator, eight different floor plans and 42 garage spaces, more than the typical one space per condo.1010 West Madison Street (Fulton Street)The asking price for the units, ranging in size from 2,350 to 5,000 square feet, will run from a little under $2 million to about $6 million. Four units in Momad are already in contract at just under $6 million, Alex Najem, a principal at Fulton Street Companies, told Crain’s.The exact price for two penthouse units haven’t been determined, but may top the $5.7 million record set for a West Loop condo in 2019. Investors are betting the district, home to tech and life science companies, is poised for a post-pandemic boom.At the Hayden at 1109 West Washington, three condos also sold for between $4 million and $5 million, two of them in 2019 and one this year.The development follows the Chicago Plan Commission’s lifting of a residential ban in much of the Fulton Market early last year. A few months later, Alderman Walter Burnett rescinded his objection in exchange for affordable units.Fulton Street Companies also got the green light for its 34-story, 433-unit apartment building last year at 1201 West Fulton Market — the first in the area in over 10 years.The firm’s website shows it acquired seven properties in the Fulton Market area.

The landlord is prolific Chicago developer Sterling Bay.Groupon’s sublease hopes could be a harbinger of what’s to come in Chicago’s office leasing market, with so many companies having laid off or furloughed employees in the wake of the virus.Prior to the pandemic, Chicago’s downtown office leasing market was having its best year since before the last recession, with companies gobbling up more downtown space than any year since 2007. It’s terrible news for landlords that already had vacancies and companies in the middle of developing new office towers.But like many other companies, Groupon is teetering on the brink. It plans to cut 44 percent of its workforce — about 2,800 employees — by the end of 2021. It had previously put up 40,000 square feet of space on the sublet market last year, before its stock fell and its CEO was ousted.Other big companies have also signaled that they wouldn’t need all the space they’d signed on for. Uber told the Tribune last month it was delaying the build-out of its 463,000-square-foot Old Post Office space.

Crain’s reported the results.Home buying will become increasingly difficult in other major cities, most notably New York, Philadelphia, Washington and Seattle. But the firm sees Chicago remaining affordable through late 2021.Chicago’s housing market remains among the slowest-growing in major U.S. cities for most of the past two years, as tracked by the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices. Adding to the bad news, it has more than twice as many homeowners who are underwater on their mortgage than the national average.The John Burns data compares cities to their own price history, figuring in variables such as incomes, home prices and employment growth, both past and projected.Using that data, the monthly payment on a median-priced Chicago home will stay in the range of 23 percent to 24 percent of the median household income though late 2021. To compare, housing costs ate up 35 percent of income during the housing boom.One recent report showed the expensive-home market has leading the way, with sales of homes valued at $500,000 or above growing substantially year over year. But that increase came at the expense of more moderately priced home sales, which declined, according to Re/Max.

Green St. (Credit: Sterling Bay and FreightWaves)Six months ago, freight tech firm Flexport signed a lease to occupy 40,000 square feet at Sterling Bay’s latest office building, 333. N. Green St. in Fulton Market.But in today’s Covid-19 world, the San Francisco-based company has abandoned those plans and will look to sublease the space as it shifts to a part work-from-home model, Crain’s reported. Flexport has offices at 370 N. Carpenter St. as well as a WeWork location not far away, though it previously said it had outgrown both.The company signed with Sterling Bay in December and expected to move 140 employees into the new 550,000-square-foot building. It never made the move to the 19-story complex, known as Gr33n, Crain’s reported.“Like many companies, Flexport is reevaluating its real estate strategy as it explores a hybrid working model,” a Flexport spokeswoman told Crain’s in a statement. “We’ll be taking a closer look at the Chicago commercial real estate market over the next few months to determine the right office location and size for our team.”Flexport’s lease, which runs through March 2027, hired CBRE to market the space for sublease, according to the report.The decision abandon the move is a blow to Sterling Bay and Chicago’s CRE market, which had been touting the emergence of tech companies like Uber that have been taking big leases. Last year, Chicago saw more than 2 million square feet of new office space absorbed into the Downtown market, about 50 percent higher than the year before. With the new office space and an increasing number of firms moving to the city from the suburbs, residential developers began building pricier projects in Chicago, able to attract young upwardly-mobile workers.Sterling Bay’s Gr33n building, which it will make its new headquarters, includes 35,000 square feet of retail. The developer inked leases for the under-construction building with advertising agency WPP, co-working firm Convene and global accounting giant Ernst & Young. Early last month, Convene said it would reduce its own office capacity by 50 percent companywide to allow workers to maintain social distancing.The coronavirus, which upended the local economy, has also cast doubt on the long-term need for that kind of massive office space in an increasingly work-from-home world.Founded seven years ago, Flexport received a $1 billion investment from Softbank in early 2019.

Scott Fitzgerald and socialite Ginevra King Mitchell with house at 901 Rosemary Road in Chicago (Getty, Wikipedia, Zillow)A Lake Forest mansion with ties to F. Scott Fitzgerald sold for $7.5 million, the highest price for a home in the town in four years.The six-bedroom, 11,600-square-foot home, known as “La Vieille Maison” hit the market in March 2021 with an asking price of $10.5 million, Crain’s reported. It went into contract this week.The 5.2-acre estate was the 40th Chicago-area home to sell for $5 million or more this year, compared with 48 in 2021. The last time a home in Lake Forest, among Chicago’s affluent suburbs, sold for more was in 2018, when Nancy Hughes, the widow of 1980s filmmaker John Hughes, paid $12 million for a 3.4-acre property on nearby Mayflower Road.Originally built in 1888 for a Chicago map publisher, the Rosemary Road mansion was remodeled in 1910 for well-to-do newlyweds William and Ginevra King Mitchell. She inspired the character Daisy Buchanan in Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby.”Fitzgerald met King Mitchell, one of Chicago’s “Big Four” debutantes during World War I, when they were teenagers in his hometown of St. Paul, Minn. After he visited her at her parent’s home in Lake Forest, King Mitchell shifted her attention to the much wealthier Mitchell, the son of a local bank president.Fitzgerald went on to create characters in Gatsby and short stories that were based on King Mitchell. Another Gatsby character, Jordan Baker, was based on one of Chicago’s other “Big Four” debutantes, amateur golfer Edith Cummings.The Mitchell family owned the home until 1988. In 1995, a couple bought the home and used it on weekends. Before listing the home in 2007 and selling it in 2011, the pipes burst. A rehab firm bought the property for $2.25 million and sold it to the most recent owners for $5 million in 2013.— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",901 Rosemary Road,A Lake Forest," mansion with ties to F.

Around 51 percent of the city’s hotels are at least 30 days delinquent or in special servicing, a step toward resolving a debt, often by a sale, putting the city sixth in the nation, The Real Deal reported last month, citing Cred IQ, a firm that tracks commercial mortgage-backed debt.Chicago’s hotels have been recovering from the pandemic at a slower pace than the national average, hobbled by a sluggish comeback for trade shows and business travel, which account for as much of a fifth of downtown hotel bookings in a typical year, The Real Deal reported this month.Downtown hotels ended 2021 at an average occupancy rate of 43 percent, up from 27 percent in 2020 and nowhere near the pre-pandemic rate of 74 percent, The Real Deal reported. Nationwide, the average was 58 percent compared with 66 percent in 2019.The partnership’s lender, Washington D.C.-based Union Labor Life Insurance, has been trying to sell the loan to prospective buyers to try to resolve the matter, Crain’s reported, citing sources familiar with the offering.The Conrad opened in 2016 following Geller and Wanxiang transforming former offices in the Erie Street structure into lodging. That was after it bought the offices of an advertising agency in 2014 for $34 million, Crain’s reported. The owners took out a $70 million loan in 2015, the outlet reported.Geller and Wanxiang also partnered in 2015 to buy the Waldorf Astoria Chicago hotel – which they later lost – in the Gold Coast for almost $112 million, then a record-high price paid for a hotel in the city, according to Crain’s. They turned over the property in 2019 to their lender, and it was sold in 2020 as hotels were being decimated by the pandemic for just less than $55 million to Joe Mansueta, a billionaire, Crain’s reported.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",101 E.

Other retailers include Ross Dress for Less, Dollar Tree, Staples and Royal Nail and Spa. The shopping center is at the intersection of Park Boulevard and Roosevelt Road. An average household living within a three-mile radius earns about $131,500, according to JLL, which represented the seller.“Investor appetite for value-add opportunities continues to increase as the market recovers from COVD and well-located centers continuing to see enhanced leasing velocity and tenant demand,” said JLL’s Amy Sands.As shoppers return to brick-and-mortar, US shopping centers have gained about 6 percent in value, according to Green Street Advisors, a California research firm. Retail centers anchored by grocery chains are considered less risky because most shoppers still tend to buy groceries in stores.Chicago’s largest retail property sale this year came in October when California investment firm LBX Investments paid $67 million for the Evergreen Plaza shopping center at 9500 to 9700 South Western Avenue. That’s just shy of the $71 million price for a Whole Foods Market sold in May 2020 in Lakeview, the most for a Chicago-area grocery store since the pandemic.North American Real Estate owns more than 20 properties in the Chicago area, most of them shopping centers, according to its website.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",613 Roosevelt Road,A suburban Chicago," shopping center anchored by a grocery store sold for $30 million, suggesting a potential rebound for retail real estate after a pandemic slump.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/12/07/suburban-chicago-shopping-center-sold-in-potential-sign-of-retail-rebound/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A suburban Chicago</a> shopping center anchored by a grocery store sold for $30 million, suggesting a potential rebound for retail real estate after a pandemic slump.","613 Roosevelt Road Chicago, IL","Petco Animal Supplies, 613 Roosevelt Rd, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8669651, -87.6427645, 0.0)",41.8669651,-87.6427645,0.0,2021

In the past five years, hotel construction has added 8,100 new rooms across the city, accounting for a 22 percent increase and leading to lower occupancy and lower rates in 2019.Details of the hotel were shared Tuesday by citizenM and the building’s developers, Sterling Bay and Magellan Development Group. The developers’ plans for a high-rise with apartments on the site were reported in May 2017, with additional details, including the inclusion of the hotel, emerging earlier this year.Construction is expected to begin early next year, but it’s unclear when the hotel and the rest of the building will open. If an undisclosed opening schedule is met, a citizenM subsidiary will buy the hotel portion of the building from the developers once it’s complete, according to a press release.Chicago-based bKL Architecture is designing the tower and Amsterdam-based design firm Concrete is handling the hotel’s interiors.

When downtown Chicago office brokers Melissa Rubenstein and Anna Panici started showing spec suites in 2015, the idea was similar to a model home.JLL’s Managing Director Melissa Rubenstein (LinkedIn/Melissa Rubenstein)“They were meant to show the tenant what could be done in the building, what the frames and finishes and palettes looked like, so they could take the building’s specs and build something out themselves,” JLL’s Rubenstein told The Real Deal.Spec offices are no longer showrooms. Instead, landlords are building dozens of them throughout buildings in order to make it easier for tenants to quickly move in.“All of our clients are actively in the spec suite game,” Rubenstein said. “They didn’t used to be as elaborate and ready to go as they are today.”She and Panici have leased about 85,000 square feet of spec offices this year across downtown buildings whose landlords they represent, including the Beacon Capital Partners and Ivanhoe Cambridge-owned 515 North State Street, where the firm RealtyAds just snagged a spot.“So many prospects don’t want to deal with the whole planning process,” said Chicago broker Wendy Katz of Stream Realty.Stream Realty’s EVP Wendy Katz (Stream Realty)Her firm leased 150,000 square feet of spec suites in the past three years, including several deals at her client KBS’ West Loop property, Accenture Tower. Stream has deals for another 70,000 square feet of spec suites that were just slightly tweaked by tenant requests, she said, and more are under construction.“We usually build out a handful at a time, different square footages, slightly different layouts,” she said.As office demand remains muted in general by the pandemic, landlords across the entire Chicago market, from downtown towers to single-story suburban offices, are pouring cash into building more spec suites. Some kicked off interior construction plans just before the health crisis, and a host of real estate market factors fueled by Covid has accelerated the spec frenzy.Landlords say having a completed product to show prospective tenants helps convince them that perks that are being added to older buildings and ever more luxurious ones in new developments are worth the cost of a lease and preferable to fully remote work schedules. Building owners also find rolling out spec suites helps control their costs.“It’s costing our clients less than it would to give tenants an improvement allowance,” JLL’s Panici said.Spec suites have also grown in size, from a maximum of about 5,000 square feet three to five years ago to 10 times that size in some properties.“Now we’re getting calls from brokers all the time asking if there are 15,000 to 25,000 square feet of existing conditions or spec suites ready to go,” Katz said.Landlords working to turn around struggling suburban offices are relying on spec suites, too. Vancouver, Canada-based Adventus is refilling several buildings in its suburban office portfolio of 3 million square feet and has completed two dozen rent-ready suites, some 90 percent of which are leased or in negotiations, the company told The Real Deal.Even once-overlooked single-story office buildings are getting interest due to spec suite programs.ONE STORY LLC owner Jonathan Berger (LinkedIn/Jonathan Berger)Jonathan Berger, who spent $9 million in 2018 to buy a single-story, multi-tenant office building near O’Hare airport and put another $2 million into renovations and amenities, has taken the property to 90 percent full from 50 percent and increased gross rents to $27 per square foot annually from $18. Each suite has its own entrance to make the property less prone to Covid transmission than towers with common areas and shared elevators, he said.“The other huge advantage is I’m saving $10 to $20 a square foot by not getting the tenant involved in construction,” Berger said. “The spaces that tenants are involved in designing cost probably about 20 percent more.”Granted, Chicago’s downtown sublease market, which has swelled to a record 6.3 million square feet, poses a direct challenge to spec suites. Because they’re being offered by former tenants, subleases usually rent at a discount, making the secondary market attractive to firms that want a low-cost option and perhaps a short-term commitment to a space ready for an immediate move-in.“Subleases, absolutely we compete with those,” Katz said.Yet spec suites offer more flexible terms than the traditional 10-year minimum. Katz said KBS wants a minimum of five-year spec suite leases at Accenture in most cases, while other landlords have allowed three years and Berger even offers one-year leases, with a rate hike for renewals.“I will do one-, two- and three-year deals, and I find my tenants tend to be sticky,” Berger said.The pandemic-induced shift in office designs – more gathering areas than private office space, fewer desks for individual work that’s increasingly remote — also dampens sublease demand compared to spec suites.“These subleases in many cases need a lot of work,” Katz said.The rise of the spec suite has also added new duties for the brokers representing landlords, who now play a more direct role in shaping a building’s finishes, just as the layouts of offices are shifting.“Anna and my job as leasing agents has completely evolved during Covid,” Rubenstein said. “Now we have to wear an architect hat, an interior designer hat and we have to nail it, we have to get it right.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",515 North State Street,As tenants lose," interest in unfinished offices amid soaring construction costs and delays, demand for spec suites — offices designed, built and furnished by landlords on a hunch they’ll be appealing enough to lease — is exploding.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/07/15/spec-tacular-chicagos-turnkey-office-suite-market-evolves/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">As tenants lose</a> interest in unfinished offices amid soaring construction costs and delays, demand for spec suites — offices designed, built and furnished by landlords on a hunch they’ll be appealing enough to lease — is exploding.","515 North State Street Chicago, IL","515 N State St, Chicago, IL 60654, USA","(41.8914211, -87.6273487, 0.0)",41.8914211,-87.6273487,0.0,2022

But that group filed for bankruptcy after the DeGraff-led investor team bought the building’s debt and foreclosed in 2015, according to Crain’s.Redevelopment on the 32,000-square-foot building could be hampered somewhat by landmark restrictions. The 144-year-old building is on the National Register of Historic Places. There is also a 99-year lease with McDonald’s for a restaurant on the first and second floors, in which the burger chain pays just $1 in annual rent.But the property’s office tenants have only short-term leases remaining, and DeGraff said he has received numerous inquiries about the property from developers in the past few years.\xa0[Crain’s]\xa0 —John O’BrienAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",36 West Randolph Street,An investment group," has taken control of the landmark Delaware Building nearly three years after filing a foreclosure suit against the previous owner, county records show.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/03/27/investor-group-takes-over-landmark-delaware-building/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">An investment group</a> has taken control of the landmark Delaware Building nearly three years after filing a foreclosure suit against the previous owner, county records show.","36 West Randolph Street Chicago, IL","36 W Randolph St, Chicago, IL 60601, USA","(41.8845976, -87.6291814, 0.0)",41.8845976,-87.6291814,0.0,2018

The village of Bellwood bought the 73,000-square-foot site and contributed the land to the $30 million housing project.The development will be a four-story building with 76 one-bedroom and four two-bedroom “independent living” apartments for seniors with incomes at or below 60 percent of the area’s median income of $63,000. Monthly rent rates are set to range from $775 to $1,100.The building will include on-site laundry, community and storage rooms, parking and intercom entry systems. Block estimates construction should be completed in July 2023 and contribute to the limited supply of affordable housing in the Chicago area.“Like the rest of the country, the Chicago area has a severe shortage of affordable housing, and options are especially limited for seniors who are living on a fixed income,” he said. “For them, communities like Bellwood are a lifeline that allows them to be part of a community close to family and friends.”Further west, in Aurora, the city set aside $400,000 of its Community Development Block Grant funds to renovate a senior housing development in the former Aurora Hotel. The property transformed from an historic former hotel into affordable senior housing in 1996. Now, with the pandemic driving down the development’s occupancy rate, it needs funds from the city to make necessary upgrades.[CBJ] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",542 25th Avenue,An affordable, housing development for seniors is set to replace a boarded-up drug store in the village of Bellwood.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/07/05/affordable-senior-housing-to-replace-ex-bellwood-walgreens/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">An affordable</a> housing development for seniors is set to replace a boarded-up drug store in the village of Bellwood.","542 25th Avenue Chicago, IL","542 25th Ave, Bellwood, IL 60104, USA","(41.88229159999999, -87.8636267, 0.0)",41.88229159999999,-87.8636267,0.0,2022

She said the house received five offers, and three of those potential buyers would have demolished it. However, the buyers plan to renovate the house. Currently it’s a 3,200-square-foot house that combines a brick Cape Cod-style house with a long, low rear addition in the back of the property.The portion of the lot that runs up to the lake, another street was initially planned.

Dubin, who designed the house for his family in 1949, included a large wall of gridded windows overlooking the ravine. “You felt like you could literally reach out and touch the trees,” Grossman continued.The first home Dubin designed for his family was the landmark Battledeck House, which was built in 1930, also in Highland Park. That property is currently on the National Register of Historic Places. Dubin also designed a number of midcentury high- and mid-rises on Marine Drive, in the Loop and in South Shore.2350 Maple Lane in Highland Park (VHT Studios)The Maple Lane house, where Dubin lived until his death in 1963, has an exterior of steel, stone and marble and an interior with marble walls, white oak trimming and slate and cork floors.The Dubin family sold the home in 1964 and that buyer kept the home for four decades before Grossman purchased it for $600,000 in 2004.When she bought the home, much of the interior wall panels were falling off and the kitchen still had its original 1949 fixtures. Grossman decided to renovate the home while trying to “stay true to Dubin’s use of natural materials.”The exterior marble has been replaced with a more winter-resilient stucco and the kitchen and interior climate systems were also updated. Part of the renovation included removing carpet, which exposed the original cork floors.

The six-bedroom home sold in an off-market deal and the buyers haven’t been identified yet.The 12,280-square-foot home sits on more than 20 acres, next to the city’s most expensive home on record: a 12-bedroom, 14,145-square-foot Glanworth Gardens mansion that Chicago billionaire J. Christopher Reyes and his wife, Anne, spent $36 million on in January of this year. The estate of late investment manager Richard Driehaus was the seller behind that home.The sellers of Villa Hortensia, Ralph and Sally MacDonald, bought it in 1997 for a price that couldn’t be determined. They first listed the mansion for $20.75 million in May 2021 and later dropped the ask to $18.5 million.After the home remained unsold, the MacDonalds took it off the market and were later approached by real estate agent Wendy Murphy of d’aprile properties with an offer from the unidentified buyers.Villa Hortensia was built in the Mediterranean style for Edward Swift of the Swift meatpacking family and named for his wife, Hortense. Its features include a stucco exterior, a red Spanish tile roof and 11 bathrooms.The home has a domed entry hall on the first floor, a grand vaulted hallway on the second and original woodwork and oak floors throughout. Outside, there is a clay tennis court, in-ground swimming pool and original outbuildings that include a three-bedroom guest house. Along the 502 feet of level lakefront there are two piers and a private boat launch.It’s unclear whether the buyers of the vintage home, which is in desperate need of repairs, will invest money into major renovations, or — given the extent of the age and decay — send in a wrecking ball and start from scratch.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",3415 Snake Rd,Chicago’s high-end," second homeowner haven Lake Geneva, Wisconsin notched its second-priciest residential sale of all-time, short of only the mansion sold earlier this year right next door.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/10/24/lake-geneva-home-sells-for-17m-in-second-priciest-deal-ever/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Chicago’s high-end</a> second homeowner haven Lake Geneva, Wisconsin notched its second-priciest residential sale of all-time, short of only the mansion sold earlier this year right next door.","3415 Snake Rd Chicago, IL","3415 Snake Rd, Lake Geneva, WI 53147, USA","(42.57765029999999, -88.4653537, 0.0)",42.57765029999999,-88.4653537,0.0,2022

Walton Street (Morningstar, Google Maps)Billionaire entrepreneur Joe Mansueto is buying the Waldorf Astoria Chicago, a year after its lender seized control of the 215-key Gold Coast hotel in foreclosure proceedings.The founder of Morningstar is paying $54 million for the luxury property at 11 E. Walton Street, according to Crain’s. The seller is Walton Street Capital.The total debt on the luxury hotel amounts to about $90 million, Crain’s reported. A Walton Street debt fund took control of the hotel from Chicago hotelier Laurence Geller and Wanxiang America Real Estate Group in September 2019. Walton Street had been a junior lender on the $112 million acquisition loan Geller and Wanxiang secured in 2015 for the purchase.The deal with Mansueto for the 60-story hotel will wipe out Walton’s equity in the building plus about 20 percent of the $67 million loan that Wells Fargo originated for the 2015 purchase, according to the report. Wells will also provide the debt for Mansueto’s acquisition; Lodging Capital Partners is a minority investor in the venture.Among his holdings, Mansueto owns the Wrigley Building — which he acquired for $255 million in 2018 — along with the 297-unit Belden-Stratford apartments, which he bought for $106 million the same year.Recent appraisals have slashed hotel values, including the Palmer House Hilton and the 610-room JW Marriott, according to Crain’s.

MedMen had tried to prevent its landlord’s suit from moving to a state court by filing a separate lawsuit, arguing that marijuana’s federally illegal status prevents Thor from being able to enforce a lease. Attorneys representing MedMen and Thor didn’t return requests for comment.The case demonstrates the quandaries that can arise for cannabis businesses landlords. It’s a growing industry that is gaining greater legitimacy but remains under a patchwork of varying state and federal regulations.Thor sued MedMen earlier this year for nearly $1 million in unpaid rent at 942-944 West Fulton Street. The dispensary leased the space for more than two years and owed more than $950,000 for failing to pay the base rent of $70,727, operating costs of $2,667 and insurance costs of $556 for 11 months, according to the landlord’s initial complaint.The dispensary inked a 15-year lease for the 23,000-square-foot warehouse style space in August 2019, months before Illinois legalized marijuana on Jan. 1, 2020. The lease provided for an annual rent of $800,000, to increase each year to $1.2 million in the fifteenth year.MedMen’s subsequent filing doesn’t dispute that the business hasn’t paid rent since before August 2021 and surrendered the premises at 942-944 West Fulton Street to Thor Equities in February.This isn’t the first time Thor has sued a cannabis business over unpaid rent. The High Times dispensary had to pay the firm $4.9 million as a result of a lawsuit from Thor, though the business never opened in San Francisco.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",944 West Fulton Street,Thor Equities’," thunder roared over a Chicago cannabis tenant, as a judge’s order allows its unpaid-rent suit to move to another venue.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/11/21/thor-wins-unpaid-rent-suit-against-fulton-market-weed-dispensary/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Thor Equities’</a> thunder roared over a Chicago cannabis tenant, as a judge’s order allows its unpaid-rent suit to move to another venue.","944 West Fulton Street Chicago, IL","944 W Fulton St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8869499, -87.6516556, 0.0)",41.8869499,-87.6516556,0.0,2022

The special-purpose entity named in the lease is responsible for it, not Industrious itself. The entity offered $14,000 to the landlord to settle the outstanding rent because it “effectively had no assets,” the complaint states.Industrious took over the space when it acquired Assemble, a co-working provider that initially signed the lease for the building’s first floor in 2014.Industrious spokesman Corey Chambliss declined to comment on specifics of the lawsuit but told Crain’s the location “was a legacy leased unit that came to us via an acquisition and as such, we made the difficult decision to shut it down.”Industrious is known for signing management agreements with its landlords to operate flexible office spaces, while its co-working competitors would sign traditional leases. The Industrious business model allows landlords to share the benefits of co-working, along with the risk that comes along with it.Stockbridge alleges in the complaint that when Industrious took over the space from Assemble, the company led the landlord to believe Industrious itself “would be financially responsible for the lease’s assignment,” even though the special-purpose entity was named on the lease.The suit also accuses Industrious of telling its users at the Jackson Boulevard location to work from other nearby spaces, effectively draining income at Stockbridge’s property.Industrious is reportedly going public sometime in 2021, and has been rapidly expanding during the pandemic. In October, the company said 600,000 square feet of new space has opened or was announced to open this year.The company has seven downtown Chicago locations, including a new 52,000-square-foot space at Willis Tower that is set to open early next year.[Crain’s] — Akiko MatsudaAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",600 West Jackson Boulevard,Flex-office startup," Industrious has been sued by the owner of an eight-story building at 600 West Jackson Boulevard for alleged fraud, breach of contract and a violation of Illinois’ Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2020/12/04/flex-office-provider-industrious-sued-by-landlord/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Flex-office startup</a> Industrious has been sued by the owner of an eight-story building at 600 West Jackson Boulevard for alleged fraud, breach of contract and a violation of Illinois’ Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act.","600 West Jackson Boulevard Chicago, IL","600 W Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60661, USA","(41.8782728, -87.6428571, 0.0)",41.8782728,-87.6428571,0.0,2020

The new tenant will be a sensory experiential retail destination at 820 North Orleans Street involving the quintessential material of Nickelodeon game shows viewers: slime.Sloomoo’s sensory experiential retail destinationSloomoo hired artists and experts in the design and music industries to build out spaces where youth and adults alike can play with features and activities such as slime waterfalls, interactive mirrors, augmented reality moments and do-it-yourself slime kitchens that let patrons create their own slime dishes and sculptures.The tenant exemplifies the kind of retailers Chicago officials and real estate players have said are important to multiply across the city to backfill empty storefronts in both the Loop and the Magnificent Mile, which has a vacancy rate of nearly 30 percent on a stretch of North Michigan Avenue. Such tenants establish new draws for families and young people that would feed potential customers to the nearby shops and restaurants.The addition of interactive art museum Color Factory at Willis Tower during the pandemic was touted by Loop retail broker John Vance of Stone Real Estate as a strong example of a smart wager on urban experiential retail amid the health crisis that has devastated other merchants reliant on crowds of office workers.“That got done and it opened in Covid, so that is a hats-off deal to the landlord, the brokers at CBRE and the tenant,” Vance said. “You’re making a bet that at some point the density [of office workers] and traffic is going to return. We believe in these tourist attractions.”In River North, the retail scene has proven more resilient and faster to start its recovery than other neighborhoods, as its smaller dependence on officer workers than the Loop gave it a leg to stand on during the crisis. Sloomoo tapped Demetrios Comodromos of Method Design architects to bring its new Chicago destination to life ahead of its November opening. Sloomoo also struck a new 28,000-square-foot lease to open a new location in Atlanta and is reopening in 12,000 square feet in New York at 475 Broadway later this month.Lasky and Peretz have been active real estate players in River North since the 1980s, and with Spectrum have assembled a portfolio of seven loft office buildings totaling 800,000 square feet, and 820 North Orleans is 155,000 square feet, according to the company’s website.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",820 North Orleans Street,Spectrum Real Estate, heads Jerry Lasky and Murray Peretz have no qualms doing business with a “slimy” new tenant.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/09/13/laskys-spectrum-lands-river-north-experiential-retail-lease/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Spectrum Real Estate</a> heads Jerry Lasky and Murray Peretz have no qualms doing business with a “slimy” new tenant.","820 North Orleans Street Chicago, IL","820 N Orleans St, Chicago, IL 60610, USA","(41.8972264, -87.63829779999999, 0.0)",41.8972264,-87.63829779999999,0.0,2022

The majority of the site, though, serves as a surface parking lot.Antunovich Associates is designing the new 14-story building proposed for the site. The facade will be a mix of brick and glass to fit in with the surrounding buildings in the West Loop. Its units will range in size from studios, multiple different one-bedroom options and two-bedroom units. Lendlease will serve as general contractor and Atlas Industries has been hired for the demolition.In addition to the residential portion, the development will also include 2,500 square feet of retail on the ground floor that fronts the intersection of West Van Buren and South Jefferson streets on the western edge of the property.The building will include a fitness center, co-working space, rooftop deck with pool and ground-floor dog run and spa as resident amenities. There will be parking for 76 vehicles and 99 bicycles.The project is being developed as an as-of-right development, meaning the proposed development fits under the site’s existing zoning rights. That means the developers are able to move forward with demolition and construction without formal city approval.The estimated date of completion for the project hasn’t been determined yet.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",566 West Van Buren Street,John O’Donnell’s, partnership with Craig Golden is set to start wrecking.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/11/01/odonnell-golden-granted-demo-permits-for-west-loop-multifamily/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">John O’Donnell’s</a> partnership with Craig Golden is set to start wrecking.","566 West Van Buren Street Chicago, IL","566 W Van Buren St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8769874, -87.6419638, 0.0)",41.8769874,-87.6419638,0.0,2022

The 148,000-square-foot facility overlooks the suburb’s namesake lake.The new facility has studios large enough for group classes that will be used for barre, cardio and strength training, indoor cycling, Pilates and yoga. Other features include a gym with cardio and strength-training equipment; programs for kids and seniors; an indoor water area with a leisure pool and adult and kids lap pools; indoor pickleball courts; dressing rooms with whirlpool and cold plunge suites, saunas and steam rooms; a rest and recovery area; salon and spa services; a restaurant with indoor and outdoor dining; and an outdoor beach club with leisure pool and waterslide, lap pool, whirlpools and cabana and lounge seating.In January, Life Time opened a 126,000-square-foot fitness center and 39,000-square-foot coworking space in Chicago’s River North. The facility marked the first coworking space for the company in Chicago and its ninth in the U.S. overall.“It’s an arms race for amenities,” James O’Reilly, president of Life Time work, told The Real Deal in May. “Some of the older inventory is really working hard to try and create more of a draw. The office, and what a place to work means, is undergoing a great rethink at the moment.”Earlier this month, Adventus Realty Trust, a Vancouver, Canada-based landlord with 3 million square feet of offices across suburban Chicago, secured a deal for another fitness company, Life Fitness, to return to the Rosemont building it vacated a year before.Life Time’s other Chicago area facilities are in Romeoville, Schaumburg, Algonquin, Warrenville, Orland Park, Burr Ridge, Bloomingdale, Oakbrook, Old Orchard, Vernon Hills and Northbrook.— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",400 North Rand Road,Life Time Group," Holdings has opened a three-story fitness club in Lake Zurich, continuing its trend of muscling up in the Chicago suburbs.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/09/26/life-time-takes-148k-sf-for-lake-zurich-fitness-center/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Life Time Group</a> Holdings has opened a three-story fitness club in Lake Zurich, continuing its trend of muscling up in the Chicago suburbs.","400 North Rand Road Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2022

Ontario Street closes, buyer Strategic Properties of North America would set the record for the priciest condo deconversion in Chicago, according to Crain’s. It would break the current record of $107 million that was set in late 2019, when ESG Kullen bought a 391-unit condo in the Gold Coast.Strategic Properties also developed the 51-story Ontario Place condo tower.The owners of Ontario Place approved the sale in a vote on Sept. 10. The deal still faces some opposition from a small minority of owners who claim the entire sales process has been rigged, according to the report.In 2019, Chicago enacted an ordinance aimed at slowing what had been a rush of condo deconversion deals. Under the measure, at least 85 percent of owners had to approve a building’s bulke sale, up from the previous 75 percent.Ontario Place owners had rejected an August 2020 offer from Strategic of $188 million. At that time, only 74 percent of owners voted to approve the deal.The latest vote had just under 90 percent of the owners voting to approve while a little under 9 percent voting against.The opposition, led by Mark Silverberg, claims the building’s condo board acted “improperly” by pushing for the sale, Crain’s reported. He and a group of supporters sued the board last year over the planned deal.Silverberg also contends the condo board improperly extended the voting deadline, which allowed more owners time to vote. That ended up raising the percentage of owners in favor of selling, from nearly 84 percent.An attorney representing the board said it was not the board’s decision, but the condo owners themselves who chose to extend the voting deadline.[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","10 E.

Advocate Medical Group is the tenant and started providing services at the location in August, according to published reports.GW’s Mitch Goltz said the deal and other recent sales in the Portage Park neighborhood on the northwest side is a testament to the area’s strength. Historically a shopping district, the area has seen increased residential density in recent months.“We have been very bullish as a company on this area for quite some time,” Goltz said.The intersection is unique because it boasts several large properties primed for repositioning, including another nearby for which GW is pursuing a large redevelopment, he said.“It’s created a lot of opportunities for the market to speak to what the demands and needs are to fill,” Goltz said.Medical offices have figured prominently into transformations of urban areas that were more exclusively shopping districts as brick and mortar retail faced challenges across the nation, and the Chicago area’s addition of medical offices has outpaced other large cities over the past decade.Goltz declined to share the property’s full development costs. Inland didn’t return a request for comment on the deal.GW is the latest firm to take advantage of elevated property values as multifamily developers move into the area. Northbrook-based Pine Tree sold a 40,000-square-foot retail strip on the Six Corners intersection to San Diego-based Realty Income for $12.6 million over the summer, a $5 million valuation increase over its last sale.Earlier this year, the Chicago City Council approved Novak Construction’s redevelopment of the former Sears store at 4730 West Irving Park Road into a six-story, 207-unit apartment building. Across the street, a $130 million project by Clark Street Real Estate and Ryan Companies to build a 10-story, 258-unit senior housing complex is scheduled for completion later this year.GW is also playing a major role in establishing the area’s new real estate makeup. The firm’s Shops at Six Corners project at 3955 North Kilpatrick Avenue would turn a former warehouse into 110 apartments and five retail buildings. Goltz said that project is still in the planning stages, after an initial proposal for the site was met with some unfavorable comments by local residents.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",3950 North Milwaukee Avenue,GW Properties cashed," in on a medical office property the firm built at Chicago’s busy Six Corners intersection, selling the two-story building to another local real estate player for more than $16 million.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/11/09/gw-properties-gets-16m-in-six-corners-medical-office-sale/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">GW Properties cashed</a> in on a medical office property the firm built at Chicago’s busy Six Corners intersection, selling the two-story building to another local real estate player for more than $16 million.","3950 North Milwaukee Avenue Chicago, IL","3950 N Milwaukee Ave, Chicago, IL 60641, USA","(41.9522679, -87.746274, 0.0)",41.9522679,-87.746274,0.0,2022

Its offering represents a test of the market for offices as companies settle into having employees clock in at a physical workplace just three or four days a week while the pandemic wanes and remote work remains popular.Properties in downtown Chicago have seen their valuations slashed by millions in some cases as tenants left or downsized their physical footprints amid the pandemic-fueled rise of remote work.Similar decisions are being made by some suburban office tenants as their leases expire, leaving buildings with space to fill, a task complicated by the convenience of remote work for many companies.The Evanston property last changed hands in 2011 when Franklin bought it for $35 million, and before that it moved in 2003 for $34 million, public records show.The property “offers unparalleled access to transportation in a highly sought-after urban-suburban environment,” Newmark’s Jim Postweiler said.Its tenants include Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Industrious, Aptinyx, North Shore University Health, Merrick Pet Care, Medpoint Digital and Athletico. It is 93 percent leased, Crain’s reported.Evanston, home to Northwestern University, hasn’t seen a large office building sold since the end of 2018, when a 10-story, 127,000 square-foot property sold for more than $32 million, public records show.While investors have been bullish on Evanston offices in the past, the market’s pace slowed amid the pandemic. Last year, an office building at 1007 Church Street was put on the market and never sold, Crain’s reported.Along with Postweiler, Newmark’s Peter Harwood, Derek Fohl and Jack Trager are representing the seller.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",45 million by Massachusetts-based owner Franklin Street,An office building," in Chicago’s Evanston suburb is being marketed for $45 million by Massachusetts-based owner Franklin Street Properties, according to Newmark, which is representing the seller.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/03/24/evanston-office-building-listed-for-45m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">An office building</a> in Chicago’s Evanston suburb is being marketed for $45 million by Massachusetts-based owner Franklin Street Properties, according to Newmark, which is representing the seller.","45 million by Massachusetts-based owner Franklin Street Chicago, IL","Massachusetts, USA","(42.4072107, -71.3824374, 0.0)",42.4072107,-71.3824374,0.0,2022

The four-building, 23-acre industrial and office complex is located at 2500 West Bradley Place in the northern part of the city.The campus runs along the banks of the North Branch of the Chicago River and is 96 percent leased. Tenants of the complex include RCN of Chicago, multiple medical offices and other recreational businesses such as IK Gymnastics, Windy City Ninjas and Goldfish Swim School. About $5.9 million is collectively generated in annual net operating income from all of the tenants.The owners of the property paid $8.3 million for the site in 2006. At that time the property consisted of three vacant buildings on the western portion of the campus. The owners secured leases over the 15 years and refinanced the property with a $14 million mortgage. The deal with Hines comes out to $210 per square foot.Another joint venture paid $6.25 million for the 355,000-square-foot building on the eastern part of the property in 2010. After leasing most of the space to more than a dozen tenants, the venture refinanced the building with a $23.4 million loan.In addition to the already-secured income, the zoning for the campus also allows for as much as 1.6 million square feet of new development. Hines could expand the campus dramatically and/or use the buildings as a last-mile distribution center for retailers that are often willing to pay higher rents for facilities to store and distribute products.[Crain’s] — Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2500 W Bradley Place,"Hines, which is"," building the new 60-story Salesforce Tower Chicago at Wolf Point, just purchased another large property in the city’s North Side.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/11/12/hines-drops-almost-100m-for-north-side-chicago-business-complex/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Hines, which is</a> building the new 60-story Salesforce Tower Chicago at Wolf Point, just purchased another large property in the city’s North Side.","2500 W Bradley Place Chicago, IL","2500 W Bradley Pl, Chicago, IL 60618, USA","(41.9501539, -87.69231769999999, 0.0)",41.9501539,-87.69231769999999,0.0,2021

The firm made $500 million of unsolicited offers for dozens of suburban Chicago condo properties in recent months, said Iman Jalali, one of Bear Peak’s leaders along with Michael Pouliot and Scott Skinger.While it’s unlikely that the firm gains enough traction to reel in purchases of most of those properties, the bullish approach to suburban condos primed to turn into rentals reflects Chicago’s surging multifamily market. Investment firm Albion recently set a record with the almost $140 million purchase of a suburban Palatine apartment complex.“Once that offer reaches the condo board members, you have no idea how they’re going to respond,” Jalali said. “All we’re looking for is a foot in the door.”To pull off a deconversion, buyers have to get condo unit owners who together control at least 75 percent of a property’s value to vote in support in an election held by the property’s condo association board. Owners against selling are overridden and forced to sell if that vote meets the threshold. In Chicago, the threshold rose to 85 percent in 2019, turning investor attention to suburban assets since the lower bar remains intact outside the city.Bear Peak uses property records to focus on condo complexes with high sales volumes before the Great Recession cooled a Chicagoland market that had been overheating.Property values on many of those units never fully recovered. While condo owners who bought at the peak are likely to be seeking to get out from underwater mortgages, others who bought at the bottom of the market often also want to cash in by accepting deconversion offers, which can net sellers 20 percent more than an individual condo unit would get on the market.Bear Peak hunts for properties that have a high concentration of unit owners who bought at either of those points.Rental rate growth in Chicago has been strong enough that deconversion investors can offer condo owners premiums, since their buildings as a whole are worth more as rentals than individual condo units.The political nature of getting condo owners’ approval intimidates some investors who would make traditional apartment investments without the headache of campaigning for a hyperlocal election to complete acquisitions. When holdout unit owners refuse to accept a deal, the process can get contentious, litigious and lengthy, so there is a limited pool of deconversion buyers.“You have to communicate and educate the current unit owners on what the offer means,” Jalali said. “\u200b\u200bIf you have that down, and you know the right properties to target, it’s not as scary.”UPDATE, 7/29/2022, 7:45am: This article has been corrected to fix references to Bear PeakAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1669 Ishnala Drive,Chicago multifamily, investment firm Bear Peak Capital completed the $21.7 million purchase of a 152-unit suburban Naperville complex in a deal that will turn the property’s housing from condos into apartment rentals.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/07/28/bear-peak-closes-22m-suburban-chicago-condo-deconversion/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Chicago multifamily</a> investment firm Bear Peak Capital completed the $21.7 million purchase of a 152-unit suburban Naperville complex in a deal that will turn the property’s housing from condos into apartment rentals.","1669 Ishnala Drive Chicago, IL","Ishnala Dr, Illinois, USA","(41.656119, -87.8026229, 0.0)",41.656119,-87.8026229,0.0,2022

Its emphasis will be to house blind and visually imparied tenants, as well as income-qualifying veterans and people with other disabilities.The ground floor will consist of a 1,500-square-foot retail space, and there will be a residential lobby and a gym.It will replace a corner parking lot for Chicago Lighthouse’s adjacent two-floor medical facility, which was dedicated by Helen Keller in 1955, and offer space into which the nonprofit’s services can expand, Chicago YIMBY reported.The unit mix will consist of 18 studios, 40 one-bedrooms, and 18 two-bedrooms, and 40 units will include features for those who are blind or visually impaired, Chicago YIMBY reported.Financing for the project consists of loans and tax credits worth up to $45.9 million so far, with some of it coming from the city through a $10.4 million loan with CBIC Bank, Chicago YIMBY reported.

The company’s lease at the 44-story West Loop building runs through June 2031.Since the start of the pandemic, companies have reduced their office footprints as remote work became the norm. While the growth of sublease availability slowed last year with offices hopeful that employees would return, available subleases for offices in the central business district was still about 83 percent more than when the pandemic began in early 2020, according to brokerage CBRE.Motorola hasn’t said why it listed part of its office or whether employees working downtown will move to its suburban office in Schaumburg, the company’s previous headquarters. In 2015, Motorola announced it would relocate its main office to the West Loop, joining a flurry of suburban companies heading to the city to acquire tech-savvy talent. The company opened up its 150,000 square feet of office space on six floors the following year.Taking over leases has been an attractive option for new tenants in the city looking for a move-in ready workspace at bargain prices as rents in Chicago remain little changed despite record vacancy rates. Recently, marketing software company Braze took over a 50,000 square foot lease at 1 North State Street from another software company, Showpad. An influx of Class A buildings offering amenities and the rising cost of raw materials have kept rents stuck at pre-pandemic levels.Buildings that are offering office space for sublease include 141 West Jackson Boulevard, 125 South Wacker Drive, and 1330 West Fulton Street.

The sellers, San Francisco-based Stockbridge Capital Group took a steep loss on the 117,000-square-foot building, which it paid $23.5 million for in 2017, plus an additional $8 million in renovations.Chicago’s office market is suffering from a glut of vacant office space. As landlords try to find tenants in a post-pandemic environment where remote working models remain popular, rising interest rates and companies offering space on the sublease market have led to many property owners to sell office buildings assets at heavily discounted prices.The Jackson building is Farbman’s second deep-discount buy in the past 13 months. He also picked up the 25-story building at 100 North LaSalle Street for $16.4 million — half of what it sold for in 2016.Farbman’s newest building is half occupied, which is an improvement from the 62 percent vacancy rate it had when Stockbridge bought it. But it still presents a leasing challenge for the veteran investor.“We’re hopeful that our reset basis will allow us to capture the tenants that are now finding it more difficult to work remotely. We’re hoping to capture some of that demand with cool, well-located space,” Farbman told the outlet. “We believe that we can catch some of the tenants as they continue to migrate west, wanting to be close to Union Station, Ogilvie (Transportation Center) and highway exits, but not willing to pay the freight to move to Fulton Market.”Farbman said that he has seen smaller companies having more success in returning to the physical office, so his company tends to focus on smaller 5,000- to 20,000-square-foot spaces rather than 100,000- and 200,000-square-foot properties.— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",600 West Jackson Boulevard,If you need further," proof that commercial real estate in Chicago is spiraling, look no further than a West Loop loft office building that sold for less than half of what the sellers paid for it just five years ago.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/10/10/andy-farbman-group-buys-discounted-west-loop-office-building/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">If you need further</a> proof that commercial real estate in Chicago is spiraling, look no further than a West Loop loft office building that sold for less than half of what the sellers paid for it just five years ago.","600 West Jackson Boulevard Chicago, IL","600 W Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60661, USA","(41.8782728, -87.6428571, 0.0)",41.8782728,-87.6428571,0.0,2022

The law firm will lease 105,000 square feet and move into the 1.5 million-square-foot building at 320 South Canal Street when it opens in early 2022, Crain’s reported.The firm is the product of a recent merger between Minneapolis-based Faegre Baker Daniels and Philadelphia-based Drinker Biddle & Reath. The two offices opening up amid the move are Drinker Biddle’s 112,000 square feet at 191 North Wacker Drive and FaegreBD’s 54,000 square feet at 311 South Wacker. The firms were the biggest tenants in those buildings.BMO Harris Bank, the namesake of the new building, will occupy 500,000 square feet in the building as part of a consolidation of its downtown Chicago offices. Financial services law firm Chapman & Cutler signed a 100,000-square-foot lease there.Co-developers Riverside Investment & Development and Convexity Properties broke ground on BMO Tower in December.Riverside is also co-developing another office tower at 110 North Wacker Drive, where it’s already attracted four other law firms relocating from elsewhere Downtown. A couple of other law firms have relocated to Riverside’s 54-story building 150 North Riverside Plaza since it opened in 2017.The trend doesn’t bode well for the Downtown office market, especially in the Central Loop, as companies are instead choosing to move to the booming West Loop and the southwest corner of the Loop near the redeveloped Old Post Office.

While Opal will pay more for the tower than its current owner, UBS Realty Investors, did in 2011, the building is almost fully leased and is expected to bring in more than $30 million in net operating income.The four-building, 696,770-square-foot office complex in north suburban Deerfield will cost Opal more than $185 million. The complex is best known for housing the Caterpillar headquarters.

Three years later it sold the Wabash site alone to California-based real estate investor Macerich for $42 million.Earlier this year the owners were interviewing brokers to sell the 472,000-square-foot building for some $200 million, according to the Chicago Tribune.Tenants were asked earlier this week by building management to certify that their leases are bound to a venture controlled by Mansueto in addition to the BDT venture. New York Life Insurance is also listed as having a role in the deal, though it is unclear whether it would be as a lender for Mansueto or an equity investor in the property, according to Crain’s.The tenant notices are typically part of the due diligence process in buying or financing a property.Spokespeople for the parties either could not be reached for comment or declined comment to Crain’s.The owners spent $70 million — with an assist from federal historic tax credits — renovating the connected towers and spent millions more leasing them up, raising occupancy from 35 percent overall to 93 percent for the south tower and 96 percent for the north. The biggest tenant is architects Perkins + Will at 60,000 square feet.Mansueto, whose net worth is $3 billion according to a Forbes estimate, founded Morningstar in 1984 and stepped down as its CEO in 2017.

The hospital was shuttered because a sharp drop in patient volume.As of Tuesday, 63 percent of Illinois hospitals’ intensive care unit beds were filled, as were 59 percent of medical/surgical beds and 32 percent of ventilators, according to state Department of Public Health data, cited by Crain’s.The state said it was also looking into reopening other hospitals, including the 230-bed Westlake Hospital in Melrose Park, in response to the pandemic.

The new construction will also have about 42,000 square feet of commercial space on the first and second floors of the buildings. Construction is expected to be completed in 2024.The project will also build 78 affordable units, consisting of studios, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three bedroom units, located on site to meet the city’s affordable housing requirements. It’s part of Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s initiative to increase the amount of required affordable housing units in new construction.Tuesday’s vote followed approvals by the Chicago Plan Commission in August and the city council’s Committee on Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards last week.The city council’s approval comes at a time when Chicago’s office vacancy rates are hitting record highs while occupancy rates in downtown apartments have been soaring.It’s a little too early to tell how the downtown rental and housing markets will look like in 2024, said Benjamin Creamer, principal of Downtown Apartment Company, but he remains optimistic.“Over the years, the downtown has been able to absorb new development and I think a lot of it is still driven by the job market,” said Creamer. Cramer noted that demand for rentals and condominiums have kept up over more than 10 years and the Loop is an attractive option for Chicagoans due to the proximity to an expressway, as well as the space it offers compared with other areas in downtown.In downtown Chicago, about 11,530 apartments will be delivered by the second quarter of 2023, according to a Marcus & Millichap’s market report. This is about 78 percent more than the 6,463 units completed during the 12 month period ended in June.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",45 South Wabash Avenue,A pair of mid-sized, towers will be added to the skyline of downtown Chicago in 2024 after a $350 million mixed-use development proposal received final approval from the city.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/09/14/chicago-city-council-approves-350m-mixed-use-development-in-the-citys-loop/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A pair of mid-sized</a> towers will be added to the skyline of downtown Chicago in 2024 after a $350 million mixed-use development proposal received final approval from the city.","45 South Wabash Avenue Chicago, IL","45 S Wabash Ave, Chicago, IL 60603, USA","(41.8810399, -87.62578979999999, 0.0)",41.8810399,-87.62578979999999,0.0,2021

Earlier this year, the embattled firm secured a $240 million refinancing for the 930,000-square-foot building from JPMorgan Chase.The new debt was securitized into several CMBS transactions, including the single-asset deal known as JPMCC 2020-LOOP. Documents associated with the securitization provide an inside look at the property’s rent roll.As of last November, the tower was 88 percent leased to 29 tenants “across the banking, government, technology, advertising and industrial sectors,” according to the loan prospectus.The largest tenant at the building, the Northern Trust Company, occupies more than 40 percent of the rentable space and pays $21.31 per square foot in annual base rent, the lowest rate among the building’s major tenants. 181 West Madison is connected by a sky bridge to Northern Trust-owned 50 South LaSalle across the street, and the two buildings jointly serve as the financial services firm’s headquarters.The tower also serves as the headquarters of its second- and third-largest tenants, consulting firm Quantitative Risk Management and Berkshire Hathaway’s Marmon Group, an industrial holding company.The fourth-largest tenant is a government agency, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which pays the priciest base rent among the building’s major tenants at $33.75 per square feet. The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce rounds out the top five with 42,000 square feet across the 35th and 36th floors.(Stacking plan for 181 West Madison Street. Source: Loan prospectus via Trepp)Elsewhere in Chicago, Northern Trust recently reconsolidated its office footprint by moving out of two other buildings into the Big Red Building at 333 South Wabash Avenue, which Michael Shvo and Deutsche Finance acquired in August for $376 million.HNA has had some success in selling off the rest of its U.S. portfolio. The company was able to sell 123 Mission Street in San Francisco and City Center in Minneapolis in 2018, and sold 850 Third Avenue in Manhattan in early 2019 amid pressure from the U.S. government.Meanwhile, the conglomerate still owns most of its priciest trophy property, the $2.2 billion office tower at 245 Park Avenue in Manhattan, although SL Green acquired a roughly $150 million preferred equity stake in the property in 2018.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",181 West Madison Street,"Three years ago, HNA"," Group paid $359 million for a Loop office tower at 181 West Madison Street, part of the Chinese conglomerate’s buying spree that included other trophy properties across the country.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2020/11/24/heres-what-tenants-pay-at-hnas-1m-sf-loop-office-tower/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Three years ago, HNA</a> Group paid $359 million for a Loop office tower at 181 West Madison Street, part of the Chinese conglomerate’s buying spree that included other trophy properties across the country.","181 West Madison Street Chicago, IL","181 W Madison St, Chicago, IL 60602, USA","(41.8816217, -87.63336799999999, 0.0)",41.8816217,-87.63336799999999,0.0,2020

02:27 PM","Demand for Chicago offices is starting to emerge as the pandemic wanes, but new supply is growing faster — and staying empty.","[""320 South Canal St (320Southcanal)Demand for Chicago offices is starting to emerge as the pandemic wanes, but new supply is growing faster — and staying empty.The conundrum resulted in a new record-high vacancy rate of 21.2 percent in the city’s central business district — the second-largest in the nation — at the end of March, Crain’s reported, citing CBRE data. That’s up from 19.7 percent on Jan. 1, and the previous historic high of 20 percent set in the third quarter last year.The recent vacancy-rate hike was driven by new supply hitting the market rather than tenants pulling out of offices.The new 1.5 million-square-foot BMO Tower by Union Station, for example, was completed with almost half the building still available.Three other new developments are also still mostly empty. Office buildings at 400 North Aberdeen Street, 1045 West Fulton Street in Fulton Market and 609 West Randolph Street in the West Loop were all completed, adding a total of eight percent more space than was available at the end of 2021.Google is negotiating a lease for around 200,000 square feet in the Aberdeen building, showing that demand remains strong for the newest developments with rich amenities, but demand remains slack for older buildings in the Loop.“I can think of four of five [buildings] that have tenants competing for spaces, and on the flip side, there are a lot more buildings that will do anything to attract and retain tenants,” CBRE’s Mark Cassata told Crain’s. “I think as the market continues to develop, the have and have-not [gap] continues to expand.”Recent trades illustrate the difference. The building at 225 West Washington Street, which is 35 years old and 40 percent vacant, sold for about $83 million in February — less than the $85 million loan the sellers borrowed against the property in 2019. Meanwhile, a partnership between Chicago investor Tim Callahan and New York’s Oak Hill Advisors bought a stake in the 55-story Bank of America Tower completed in 2020 that valued the property at more than $1 billion — the city’s second highest-valuation for an office building behind only Willis Tower.Leasing activity was far from dormant in the first quarter, though. Online consumer lender Avant doubled its downtown office space with an 80,000-square-foot lease at the Merchandise Mart. And Stripe, a San Francisco-based online payments company, leased 45,000 square feet at 350 North Orleans in an expansion from its office at a River North WeWork co-working spot.Big sublease offerings hit the market even as demand for new space started to tick up, though. Motorola Solutions listed 54,000 square feet at 500 West Monroe Street on the secondary market, and sports betting company Fubo Gaming, which was already on a sublease, is marketing its 30,000 square feet at 1 North Dearborn Street.Before the pandemic, the CBD’s vacancy rate was 13.8 percent, and new records were set in four of the past five quarters, Crain’s reported.[Crain’s] — Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",320 South Canal St,Demand for Chicago," offices is starting to emerge as the pandemic wanes, but new supply is growing faster — and staying empty.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/04/15/downtown-chicago-office-vacancy-sets-record-with-new-development-finishes/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Demand for Chicago</a> offices is starting to emerge as the pandemic wanes, but new supply is growing faster — and staying empty.","320 South Canal St Chicago, IL","320 S Canal St, Chicago, IL 60606, USA","(41.877226, -87.639983, 0.0)",41.877226,-87.639983,0.0,2022

09:00 AM",Efforts by two Chicago suburbs to redevelop dilapidated shopping centers are confronting fiscal and municipal obstacles ranging from an owner’s delays to local qualms about meeting an affordable housing threshold.,"[""Northbrook Court and International Plaza (Google Maps)Efforts by two Chicago suburbs to redevelop dilapidated shopping centers are confronting fiscal and municipal obstacles ranging from an owner’s delays to local qualms about meeting an affordable housing threshold.In Northbrook, officials granted a second extension to Brookfield Properties, the owner of Northbrook Court, to revise its redevelopment plan for the mall. In Arlington Heights, officials are concerned that a proposal to turn a 1980s-era shopping plaza into apartments won’t integrate affordable units into the rest of them.Re-use can’t come soon enough for malls that in some cases date back decades. Schaumburg developer Urban Street Group wants to build a 302-unit apartment complex on the north side of Arlington Heights’ 1980s-era International Plaza and a commercial development with office and retail components on the south. The village has been trying to redevelop the property since 2002.“It’s dangerous over there,” said Arlington Heights Trustee Rich Baldino. “It’s falling down.”The struggles underscore the difficulty of bringing large, outdated shopping centers into the 21st century as suburban communities grapple with opportunities and challenges those properties present in a market starting to reset after two years of disruption.Arlington Heights tried to spur the redevelopment by putting the mall into a Tax Increment Funding District that it extended for 12 years in 2014. Over the years, a contract with another developer and an agreement with a major retailer have fallen through and the property has been the subject of numerous lawsuits, Charles Perkins, director of planning and community development for Arlington Heights, said at a village board meeting this week.“We work very hard to find solutions for challenging development sites,” Urban Street Group senior vice president Jon Dennis told the village board on Monday, acknowledging the many starts and stops efforts to redevelop the property have faced. “We think we have a great solution to make it happen.”Of the apartment units Urban Street proposed, 37 would be designated as affordable housing for seniors. While that tops the percentage required by the village’s inclusionary housing ordinance, some trustees said they were concerned about Urban Street’s plan to have those units built in a separate building by another firm, Northpointe Development Corporation. The ordinance calls for affordable units to be integrated with the rest of the units and built at the same time.The Urban Street plan allows the developer to fund the project with federal tax credits, without which it’s hard to build affordable housing, Dennis said.“My concern is that creates a situation where you are segregating your affordable housing,” said Village Trustee Mary Beth Canty. “It creates an incentive to put affordable housing in one area of the community and not intermingle it with the market rate,” raising questions about whether residents will have access to amenities,” she said.In Northbrook, officials approved $27 million in subsidies three years ago to overhaul Northbrook Court at 1515 Lake Cook Road, according to Crain’s. The village board voted last month to extend a deadline for the mall owner’s revised redevelopment plan to Dec. 23 from Aug. 1, the second time the board approved a shift in timing in as many years. A $250 million redevelopment plan that it signed off on in 2019 was delayed due to the pandemic.The developer behind Brookfield’s original redevelopment plan for Northbrook Court is Ryan Properties, the same company that Arlington Heights was at one time under contract with for a previously proposed redevelopment of International Plaza.In 2021, a group led by New York-based Brookfield stopped paying the $117 million remaining mortgage on the mall, leading lender Barings to shop for brokers to potentially sell the 1-million-square foot property. Northbrook Court was also among the malls that Cook County reported had skipped a property tax payment last year, and its vacancy rate has jumped as department stores and other smaller retailers have closed.Brookfield told Crains that it plans to finish what it started, without providing details. The firm recently repaid the mall’s $131 million loan from Barings.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1515 Lake Cook Road,Efforts by two, Chicago suburbs to redevelop dilapidated shopping centers are confronting fiscal and municipal obstacles ranging from an owner’s delays to local qualms about meeting an affordable housing threshold.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/18/chicago-suburbs-face-obstacles-in-redeveloping-malls/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Efforts by two</a> Chicago suburbs to redevelop dilapidated shopping centers are confronting fiscal and municipal obstacles ranging from an owner’s delays to local qualms about meeting an affordable housing threshold.","1515 Lake Cook Road Chicago, IL","1515 Lake Cook Rd, Northbrook, IL 60062, USA","(42.150587, -87.8163435, 0.0)",42.150587,-87.8163435,0.0,2022

The building will have 93 studio units and 9 one-bedroom apartments. Of the units, 81 will be market-rate and 21 will be marketed as affordable housing. The building will also have a fitness center, community rooms, bicycle storage and a rooftop deck.Two external fire escapes will be removed and a new interior stair will be added instead. The developers will also rebuild the existing boiler structure on the southern end of the property to allow for more space in the apartments and common areas. In addition, the masonry facade will be repaired and exterior windows will be replaced.MCM and Washington Park are financing the project with about $36.8 million from multiple sources. Funding will include $2.3 million in developer equity, $3 million in deferred developer fees, $6.3 million in Historic Tax Credits, $14.7 million in lender financing, $2.5 million in TIF funding, $3 million from a City Grant and $5 million in for funding the project as the joint venture “Community Interest Company.”While the developers haven’t filed any permits for the work, the council’s approval means work can begin.

The NHP Foundation, a non-profit real estate organization dedicated to preserving affordable housing, is leading the effort to renovate the property. The City Council’s approval will allocate city funds to NHP Foundation to complete the project, according to Chicago YIMBY.The property sits several blocks from Lake Michigan and currently includes 64 rooms that will be converted into 30 studio apartments. The apartments will be earmarked for tenants making between 30 and 50 percent of Lincoln Park’s Area Median Income of $100,000, according to Chicago YIMBY. The building’s current residents will be given preference if they choose to return once the renovation is completed.Additional renovations include turning the eight ground-floor retail spaces into four, as well as replacing the building’s doors, windows and elevators. The project will be financed through tax-exempt bonds, loans, tax credits, and city financing. The project was initially pitched in 2019, and little in the design has changed since then.Beyond the Covent renovation, the developer is proposing a new construction seven-story building adjacent to the hotel. Designed by Brininstool + Lynch, the project would incude ground-floor retail, a parking lot, and 84 units. The developer plans to pay almost $800,000 because only two of the units will be affordable. That $800,000 will go toward renovation costs of the Covent.The Covent Hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Built in 1915, it was one of Chicago’s residential hotels that were built during the early 1900s to house Chicago’s fast-growing working class population.[Chicago YIMBY] — Miranda DavisAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2653 N Clark Street,The Covent Hotel, building is set for a $21 million mixed-use renovation after the Chicago City Council approved a plan to convert the property into affordable studio apartments.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/02/24/chicago-city-council-green-lights-covent-hotel-multifamily-renovation/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Covent Hotel</a> building is set for a $21 million mixed-use renovation after the Chicago City Council approved a plan to convert the property into affordable studio apartments.","2653 N Clark Street Chicago, IL","2653 N Clark St, Chicago, IL 60614, USA","(41.931071, -87.64395809999999, 0.0)",41.931071,-87.64395809999999,0.0,2022

The 223,000-square-foot property is mostly vacant.It was sold by Acres Capital, which bought the building a year ago when its previous owners were facing a potential mortgage default.The office tenants still in the building will remain under Intersection’s conversion plan, yet a majority of the building will be converted into apartments. About 46 percent of the building is leased to office tenants, and Chavin said more than half of the building would likely be converted.Intersection plans to add a “rooftop amenity” to the building, he said. The total cost of the conversion will likely be greater than what the company paid for the building.Mayor Lori Lightfoot has invited developers to convert outdated office buildings on and near LaSalle Street into residential buildings in an effort to restore foot traffic in the Loop. The city is offering tax increment financing plans to temporarily freeze property tax increases on improvements, amongst other public incentives, to developers of these projects as long as at least 30 percent of the units are affordable.While the Wacker Place project is a few blocks east of LaSalle, Chavin said he plans to pursue historic tax credits for the 94-year-old building and request that Chicago designate the building a landmark, which would make it eligible for a Class L property tax incentive. The city has encouraged developers to take similar paths to gain financial viability for LaSalle Street residential conversions of offices.The Wacker Place building has 23 tenants. As many of them are smaller tenants with floor plates under 10,000 square feet, Intersection will likely have to move them to create a contiguous block of the building that can be redeveloped.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",65 East Wacker Place,Truman Tolefree’s, Intersection Realty Group is jolting Chicago’s office-to-apartments conversion market with a play for a distressed Loop building.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/10/12/intersection-realty-takes-on-loop-apartment-conversion-in-19m-deal/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Truman Tolefree’s</a> Intersection Realty Group is jolting Chicago’s office-to-apartments conversion market with a play for a distressed Loop building.","65 East Wacker Place Chicago, IL","65 E Wacker Pl, Chicago, IL 60601, USA","(41.886616, -87.6255412, 0.0)",41.886616,-87.6255412,0.0,2022

He also received a separate 10-year sentence for skimming more than $2 million from the proceeds of the Vegas casinos.Upon his parole in 1992, the 63-year-old Lombardo took out classified ads in the Chicago Tribune that proclaimed his innocence.“If anyone hears my name used in connection with any criminal activity,” the ads read, “please notify the FBI, local police and my parole officer, Ron Kumke.”Lombardo became a fugitive in 2005 when it was revealed that he had been implicated in the FBI’s investigation of 18 mob-related murders dating back to 1970. He was arrested in Elmwood Park, 10 miles from his Ohio Street home, after an international manhunt.He was convicted of multiple crimes, including racketeering, loan-sharking and a 1974 murder in Bensenville.Lombardo, who died 10 years into a life sentence, proclaimed his innocence in letters in his final days, according to ABC7 Chicago reporter Chuck Goudie.“I am Positively Not Guilty of all charges in the indictment,” Lombardo wrote, according to Goudie. “I rest my case Judge.”[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2210 West Ohio Street,The Ohio Street home," of reputed mobster Joey “The Clown” Lombardo is under contract.

Fulton Market, the report noted. That would be nearly 20 percent over what it paid developer Sterling Bay for the complex in 2016.Google, which occupies 387,000 square feet in the building, had been gobbling up Chicago office space leading up to the pandemic. In March 2020, it was set to more than double its local footprint, with space at four locations for a total of 1.3 million square feet.For ARA, the decision to sell comes at a time when the local office market vacancy rate hovers at 15.5 percent and some projections show it could rise to 18 percent by the end of 2022. Recent retreats from the market include a scrapped 1.2 million-square-foot office and residential complex along the Chicago River, across from Goose Island; and a West Loop warehouse owner’s abandoned plans for loft-style office conversion.At 1000 W. Fulton, Google’s lease runs through 2028. The property, known as 1K Fulton, is nearly completely leased, according to the report.

Pappageorge Haymes Partners is the design architect for the project.The development broke ground last week and is expected to be completed by November 2022, according to Pappageorge Haymes Partners.The building is located near the Chicago River and the 1.65 million-square-foot 600 West Chicago building, where tenants include Groupon, the Big Ten Network and Echo Global Logistics.The company’s website shows four additional projects including a 321-unit luxury apartment in Wheeling and a 212-unit luxury unit project near the Des Plaines Metra Station. The first project, 1509 Western Avenue located in Wicker Park is an 18-unit rental building consisting of one and two bedrooms.DAC Developments is led by Daniel Rezko, whose father Tony Rezko was convicted in 2008 on 16 counts of fraud, bribery and money laundering crimes while working for disgraced Governor Rod Blagojevich.

The deal for the 354,000-square-foot building at 263 Shuman Avenue was followed by the parties splitting the building from the land; Opal paid an unknown sum for the leasehold on the property, a move that extended its office buying spree in the Chicago area.Opal made deals last year to pick up the 50-story office tower at 35 West Wacker Drive in Chicago’s Loop for $415 million, and spent another $180 million on the Corporate 500 office campus in suburban Deerfield. Its purchase of the eight-story Highland Landmark II office building in suburban Downers Grove pushed its buying spree to a total of $650 million.The firm is betting that a rebound is in store for Chicago’s office market by taking on property like the Naperville building left by OfficeMax in 2015, even as the pandemic raises questions about the future of office demand. New leasing activity in Chicago so far has been concentrated on the newest developments with rich amenities, while vacancies hang near record highs both downtown and in suburban markets.Its optimism on the future suburban office market isn’t limited to Chicago. Opal spent $150 million on an Orange County, California office tower last year, too.The Naperville building’s sale provides an exit from the building for a venture of Chicago-based Franklin Partners and Northbrook-based Bixby Bridge Capital that bought the building while it was vacant in 2018, taking out a $21.7 million loan to acquire the property, Crain’s reported. Its previous owner handed the keys back to its lender on a $49 million loan, Crain’s reported, making it unclear how much the Franklin and Bixby venture paid to buy it from the special servicer appointed to oversee the troubled loan.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",263 Shuman Avenue,A New York firm just, upped its bet on Chicago after already spending almost $650 million on three pieces of commercial real estate.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/04/13/new-york-investor-extends-chicago-buying-spree-with-former-officemax-hq/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A New York firm just</a> upped its bet on Chicago after already spending almost $650 million on three pieces of commercial real estate.","263 Shuman Avenue Chicago, IL","954 W Washington Blvd #750, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8833111, -87.65181659999999, 0.0)",41.8833111,-87.65181659999999,0.0,2022

Rockwell St. could increase traffic congestion, according to Block Club.Kalanick’s venture, CloudKitchens, was pursuing Transit-Oriented Development status for the North Center construction. The designation provides city incentives to projects near transit hubs, decreasing the required number of parking spots the developer must build.Alderman Matt Martin said it “became clear that CloudKitchens’ business model would result in a significant increase in car traffic on Rockwell Avenue and in the surrounding residential streets,” according to the report.Kalanick last year announced he was investing $150 million into CloudKitchens’ parent company, City Storage Systems LLC.

The deal is a sale-leaseback, meaning the property is sold then immediately leased back to the building’s sole tenant, Chicago marketing firm AgencyEA.The property last sold for $4.6 million in 2014, Cook County public records show. The buyer is “a private ultra-high net worth investor from Spain,” said Azora Exan’s Thania Potosome, declining to provide the buyer’s name.At its sale price, just under the $15 million asking price, it offers the new owner a 6.2 percent cap rate, a measure of rental income after expenses divided by a property’s purchase price, said James Mead of SVN’s Chicago office, who represented the seller, SALF 920 LLC. The seller put less than $5 million into the property since buying it eight years ago, adding features such as a rooftop deck.“Despite all the negative publicity Chicago is getting, there is still appetite from foreign investors for these types of deals,” Mead said.The sale demonstrates the value of Class B buildings off the beaten path — the building is outside Chicago’s main business district, the Loop — especially when leased to a single tenant. The sale-leaseback setup is a factor in adding value to such properties, Mead said.“A lot of buildings in that market are multi-tenant and it’s not as attractive to some investors,” Mead said.Demand for sale-leasebacks has strengthened during the pandemic because they allow owners to free up cash, although they were trending upward before 2020.Earlier this month, CME sold a 300,000-square-foot building at 333 South LaSalle Street for $39.5 million in a sale-leaseback transaction with electric utility ComEd.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",311 W Walton Street,A five-story office," building in Chicago’s River North neighborhood sold for more than triple the price it last traded for eight years ago, underscoring the value of sale-leaseback deals outside the city’s central business district.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/06/28/river-north-office-building-triples-in-value-since-2014/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A five-story office</a> building in Chicago’s River North neighborhood sold for more than triple the price it last traded for eight years ago, underscoring the value of sale-leaseback deals outside the city’s central business district.","311 W Walton Street Chicago, IL","311 W Walton St, Chicago, IL 60610, USA","(41.8995079, -87.6361378, 0.0)",41.8995079,-87.6361378,0.0,2022

Sangamon Street (LinkedIn, Google Maps)Joy Jordan wants to develop Chicago offices after nearly a decade selling them as a broker representing some of the city’s highest-profile landlords.The 34-year-old former Telos Group and Sterling Bay leasing agent is under contract to buy Fulton Market property with plans to develop an office building up to 200,000 square feet, she told Crain’s. Jordan parted with Sterling Bay last year after helping lease its Lincoln Yards project, and previously oversaw leasing at Willis Tower and other downtown buildings for Telos.She didn’t specify which property she’s buying, but the outlet reported she is targeting a half-acre site at 415-417 North Sangamon Street for redevelopment, citing people familiar with her plans.Her project, should it receive City Council approval for a needed zoning change, would be the latest office project to rise in Fulton Market, the lone Chicago commercial real estate market to gain tenants during the pandemic. The district has posed a challenge for older properties in the Loop amid the slow return to office as it has landed top-tier tenants seeking new development and amenities.“Fulton Market has just been on fire, and there’s not enough supply to meet the demand on the office side,” Jordan told Crain’s.Fulton Market will also present Jordan with plenty of competition from her neighbors, with established developers like her former employer Sterling Bay and Trammell Crow planning new office buildings in the neighborhood. Another 150,000-square-foot office building at 1045 West Fulton Street was recently completed without signing any tenants. Although its developer Fulton Street Cos. is closing in on a lease with law firm Norton Rose Fulbright in what could be a game-changer for the district by landing its first big law firm, a departure from the Loop’s hold on traditional non-tech tenants.Jordan named her development venture Fortem Voluntas, a Latin phrase meaning “strong will,” in part because she stands out among Chicago’s mostly male major office developers.“A lot of women are just too scared and don’t feel like they have the support from capital (investors),” Jordan told Crain’s. “It’s a very male, buddy-buddy business (where) the capital knows the capital and women are just not part of that community.”Her investors include high-net worth real estate investors and she plans to develop the building on speculation, with no tenants signed in advance of construction, betting Fulton Market’s allure keeps growing. Another former Sterling Bay employee, Howard Blair, is also an investor, and is consulting for Jordan to oversee construction details of the project. It will likely cost $100 million total, including the land acquisition, she told Crain’s.The property at the northeast corner of Sangamon and Kinzie streets holds a 43,738-square-foot building and a vacant lot next door, both owned by an entity tied to investor Grey Bemis-Kelley, Crain’s reported, citing public records. The property owner hired Cushman & Wakefield last year to market the property, and people familiar with Fulton Market pricing told Crain’s they expect it to sell for more than $11 million, or $500 per square foot.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",417 N.

Wacker Drive & Spear Street Capital founder John Grassi (Credit: Hines)Chicago office market sales activity has plummeted over the last year, but one investor is all in.Spear Street Capital is paying $225 million — or $346 per square foot — for the office tower at 225 West Wacker Drive, sources told Crain’s.This purchase comes after San Francisco-based Spear Street paid $412 million in June for a 46-story office tower at 500 West Monroe Street in the West Loop. The seller was Georgia-based Piedmont Office Realty Trust. It’s still the biggest office deal Chicago has seen since February 2018, according to Crain’s, as commercial investment sales have continued to drop.JLL reported that sales of office, apartment, hotel and industrial buildings totaled $8.1 billion in 2019, compared to the post-recession peak of $16 billion in 2018. Office trades had the sharpest falloff, totaling $1.2 billion in transactions last year compared to $4.7 billion in 2018.For Spear Street’s latest deal, the seller, Mirae Asset Global Investments, hoped to get $245 million when it put the 651,000-square-foot building up for sale last fall. The South Korean real estate firm paid $218 million for it in 2013.The building is 96 percent leased, with 27 tenants, including Cushman & Wakefield. But occupancy is expected to fall to 70 percent as some tenants’ leases expire over the next 18 months, according to Real Estate Alert, which first reported the sale.Those upcoming vacancies could have led to a price chop from the listed amount, Crain’s said. The building is located in an area along the Chicago River, where office tenants pay 17 percent more than the average rent for top-tier buildings elsewhere downtown, according to Cushman & Wakefield.

Owner Michael Wilkie first tried to sell it privately in July 2020 for $24.5 million, then cut the price to $17 million in November.Wilkie, chairman of industrial products distributor DGI Supply, told the Wall Street Journal when he first tried to sell that he was moving to Key Largo in Florida to escape Midwestern winters. He’s made only minor changes since he moved in, including a kitchen renovation.It sits atop the entire 24th and 25th floors of a vintage cooperative building at 1500 North Lake Shore Drive that was designed by New York architect Rosario Candela and Chicago firm McNally & Quinn, according to the Chicago Tribune. It was built for its first owner, George Woodruff, a banker and Republican Party leader.

Earlier this year, California hotel investor Sunstone called Chicago’s hotel market oversupplied as it sold two assets at losses from their purchase prices.Yet Fulton Market’s hotels such as the Hoxton and SoHo House and their retail offerings have contributed to the work-play-live scene that’s made the Chicago neighborhood among the hottest of late.The development team consists of Joseph A. McMillan, CEO and chairman of Azur, and Golub & Company. McMillan also leads luxury developer DDG, which was the firm working with Chicago’s Marc Realty to bring a 13-story, 250-room hotel branded by Standard to the Randolph Street site, according to previously published reports.Marc Realty is no longer involved in the project, a spokesperson for the developers said.The redirection toward residential adds the project to the ongoing apartment development boom in the West Loop and especially in Fulton Market, where both housing and offices are in demand. The West Loop had more than 9,000 units planned or under construction — more than the rest of downtown Chicago neighborhoods combined – as of March. Much of that development has come after the City Council did away with a ban on residential zoning in that area in April 2021.The tower is planned for the western portion of the site at the corner of West Randolph Street and North Racine Avenue, overlooking the intersection of North Willard Court and West Randolph. It’s set to include 400 rental units, 80 of which will be marketed as affordable housing to meet the city’s 20 percent Affordable Requirements Ordinance.The project has to go before the city’s Zoning Committee and Plan Commission, as well as the City Council, for approval. There’s not yet a public timeline for its completion.Other glass high-rises recently proposed for Fulton Market include Chicago developer Fred Latsko’s plans for nearly 40 stories at 375 North Morgan Street on the site of the Guinness brewery and taproom under construction. Emerging developer Joy Jordan is also moving forward with a 17-story mixed-use tower on Sangamon Street, which will include office and retail space. Construction on Sterling Bay’s first multifamily project in Fulton Market is also underway at 160 North Morgan Street.Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified Mill Hill Capital as a member of the development team. The story has been updated to include Golub & Company as Azur’s development partner.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1234 West Randolph Street,"UPDATED Sept. 22,"," 2022, 10:45 a.m.: New York developer Azur Cos. and Chicago’s Golub & Company have pivoted from a hotel to a purely residential project for their planned metal and glass tower in Fulton Market.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/09/21/new-york-developers-pivot-fulton-market-tower/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">UPDATED Sept. 22,</a> 2022, 10:45 a.m.: New York developer Azur Cos. and Chicago’s Golub & Company have pivoted from a hotel to a purely residential project for their planned metal and glass tower in Fulton Market.","1234 West Randolph Street Chicago, IL","1234 W Randolph St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.884625, -87.6579781, 0.0)",41.884625,-87.6579781,0.0,2022

Craig and Alexis Eyler say the Darvish’s Evanston home blocks the Eylers’ view of Lake Michigan, according to the report.The Darvishes paid $4.6 million in May for the six-bedroom lakefront home at 90 Kedzie Street, the second-most expensive home sale ever recorded in Evanston. When they sought to build a fence around their yard, the Eylers agreed not to object, as long as the fence was made of wrought iron, according to the suit.Instead, the Darvishes built a solid, 6-foot-tall cedar fence that violates an easement from the 1940s guaranteeing the Eylers unobstructed views of the lake, according to the suit.The suit seeks unspecified damages from the pitcher and his wife.His 5,400-square-foot home, on a third of an acre, went on the market last October 2017 for $4.2 million, but Darvish added an adjoining lot. The property includes 150 feet of lake frontage and Evanston’s only private deep-water dock, Crain’s reported last year.Darvish signed to a six-year, $126 million contract in February 2018 but missed most of last season with an arm injury.

The order clears the way for the 1,635-room property, the city’s second largest after the Hyatt Regency, to be sold for a fraction of its value before the pandemic crushed the hospitality industry.The ruling came less than a week after Wells Fargo took control of the 610-room JW Marriott Chicago in the Loop after the owner, a venture of Orlando-based Estein USA, defaulted on a $203.5 million loan. Wells Fargo won control with the sole $251 million bid.Palmer House, among the first to suffer as Covid erupted, was valued at $328 million in March, compared with its $560 million appraisal in 2018, when Thor took out the mortgage. Lender Wells Fargo asked the court almost two years ago to appoint a receiver for the property, at 17 East Monroe Street, in one of the largest local foreclosure lawsuits against Thor over the defaulted loan.Thor had another loan tied to the property that was sold to CMBS investors. Investors in the $94 million mezzanine loan will probably lose their stake in the property once a sheriff’s foreclosure sale is complete. Wells Fargo could buy the property and then sell it.Thor fought against the foreclosure by arguing that the pandemic made it impossible for the company to make mortgage payments.The judge determined that since there wasn’t a government order that forced the closure of the hotel, it still needed to make payments on the mortgage. Judge Edward Robles said a pandemic isn’t an “unforeseeable event” and that the company could have continued to pay the mortgage.Thor also faces another potential foreclosure lawsuit, on the retail part of the Palmer House property. A trustee representing the investors of a $62 million CMBS loan on the retail space filed a foreclosure complaint in December 2020.[CCB] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",17 East Monroe Street,A Cook County judge," issued an order of foreclosure against New York’s Thor Equities for defaulting on its $333.2 million mortgage on Palmer House Hilton Chicago, Crain’s reported.

Canal Street (Google Maps)Debt tied to office buildings in Chicago’s Loop is set to be sold for a loss as major tenants BMO Harris Bank and law firm Chapman & Cutler relocate within the city, adding to downtown commercial real estate distress.New York-based Union Bank has hired brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle to sell a loan of almost $191 million on the buildings at 115 South LaSalle Street and 111 West Monroe Street, Crain’s reported, citing sources familiar with the offering.About 900,000 square feet of the two structures, which are 27 and 23 stories, have been home to BMO and the law firm, but both those tenants are relocating to the bank’s namesake property completed last year, BMO Tower, next to Union Station, Crain’s reported.With record-high downtown office vacancies amid the pandemic and the moves pending, the buildings’ owner, South Korea-based Samsung Life Insurance, probably would have struggled to refinance its mortgage.If a loan sale closes, it would worsen the pain in the Loop’s office market, which has been hit with a series of missed mortgage payments by building owners totaling around $600 million, The Real Deal reported last week.AMTrust Realty and Brookfield Properties, which own buildings where loan payments have been missed at 135 South LaSalle Street immediately south of the Samsung-owned BMO office and on 175 Jackson Boulevard, recently said they will start negotiations about restructuring their loans.That means there is competition with other distressed properties for Union Bank as it looks to unload the soon-to-be-former BMO office.AmTrust’s 1.3 million-square-foot building on LaSalle, which is 87 years old, is already mostly vacant after Bank of America left for its own namesake tower on Wacker Drive.Landlords of older buildings in particular are feeling the pain as companies are signing leases for Class A buildings in Fulton Market, TRD has reported.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",115 S.

The brand decided not to renew a lease that expires at the end of the year.Old Navy has occupied the space at 150 North State Street for the past 10 years. Before it took over from Borders, Old Navy had a store about a block south that’s now home to Primark. Old Navy has five stores in the Chicago area proper.The clothing store, owned by San Francisco-based Gap, hasn’t said if it would open a smaller store somewhere nearby or leave the neighborhood altogether. The decision to exit comes after DSW said in June that it’s leaving its store at 35 South State Street in June.Gap also closed its Chicago flagship store last year. Gap occupied a three-story, 46,000 square foot building at 555 North Michigan Ave. from 2000 until its lease expired in November 2020, and the store closed in January 2021.The soon-to-be-vacant Old Navy space has 7,300 square feet at street level and the remaining 24,700 square feet spans the second, third and lower levels. According to CBRE, which is marketing the space, a new tenant would probably pay a lower rent than Old Navy because of the Loop’s weak state. Disney, New York & Co. and Urban Outfitters closed retail outlets on State Street during the pandemic.In the Central Loop, which includes State Street, the vacancy rate fell to 23.1 percent at the end of 2021, from 26.1 percent six months earlier, brokerage Stone Real Estate found.

01:05 PM","Felicia Kelly, a restaurant owner in Chicago’s historic Bronzeville district, is sure the South Side community’s revival is here to stay after development was stalled for more than a decade by the financial crisis and rising crime.","[""(Bronzeville Lakefront, Zillow)Felicia Kelly, a restaurant owner in Chicago’s historic Bronzeville district, is sure the South Side community’s revival is here to stay after development was stalled for more than a decade by the financial crisis and rising crime.That kind of hope was once rare in a neighborhood that inspired poet Gwendolyn Brooks to write We Real Cool about the young players she saw at Bronzeville’s Golden Shovel pool hall. The poem ends: “We Sing sin. We Thin gin. We Jazz June. We Die soon.’’Bronzeville, dubbed the city’s “Black Metropolis,” is home to African-American businesses and artists, but has long been underdeveloped, with thousands of vacant lots after years of disinvestment. Now, business owners like Kelly are encouraged as the city promotes new developments in the South Side community that once was home to Brooks and musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Nat “King” Cole, Sam Cook, Dinah Washington, Quincy Jones, and Herbie Hancock.Kelly opened her Cajun seafood restaurant ‘Surf’s Up Bronzeville’ at 43rd Street and South Cottage Grove Avenue on Dec. 30, after seeing a bustling scene of new Black-owned mom-and-pop stores. Compared with Surf’s Up South Shore, the store’s first location in the city, Kelly said they have been getting a lot more customers due to foot traffic in the area.“It took a couple of years for our sister restaurant on 71st and South Shore to really pick up,” Kelly said. “They had to host a lot of events to get recognized. I can say we’ve been getting recognition pretty quickly. On Fridays and Saturdays, we see well over 100 or more people.”Multifamily Investors\nMeanwhile, adding to the revitalization, the neighborhood is drawing multifamily property investors chasing higher returns and Chicagoans in search of affordable homes at a time when soaring prices have put much of the city and suburbs out of reach for many buyers.Some 28 new construction houses or townhouses sold in Bronzeville last year, the largest number of newly-built homes sold in any Chicago neighborhood in 2021, according to Crain’s. The Humboldt Park neighborhood trailed, with sales of 25 homes, and Logan Square and Bridgeport followed with 21 each.Sandwiched between the Loop and Hyde Park on the shore of Lake Michigan, the proximity to downtown Chicago and affordability are what drove buyers to Bronzeville during the pandemic when home prices surged. The neighborhood features late 19th and early 20th century attached row houses in the Italianate, Queen Anne, Romanesque, and Classical Revival styles as well as more modern single-family homes.Those houses “were flying off the market because these were luxury homes that you would find in Lincoln Park or Logan Square for half the price in some cases,” said Sheila Dantzler, a Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty agent.Pre-pandemic, a new 3,000-square-foot single-family home in Bronzeville would be listed anywhere between $600,000 and $700,000, according to Dantzler. “Last year, that [price] ticked up to anywhere between $700,000 and $900,000,” she said.The city’s biggest challenges as it works to spur development in Bronzeville are to bring down the crime rate and avoid pricing out long-time residents.“It’s a systemic risk” for developers looking to develop in the city, said Kier Group’s partner Aaron Sklar, who specializes in brokering multifamily properties on the city’s South and West Sides.Persistent Crime\nThe number of crime incidents including robbery, homicide, and sexual assault last year totaled 1,548 in Bronzeville, about 49 percent higher than the affluent Lincoln Park’s tally of 1,040, according to the Chicago Police Department.The median price of homes sold in Bronzeville was more than $550,000 in the first 11 months of 2021, according to the Chicago Association of Realtors. That compares with $318,000, the median price of homes sold across the city in the same period.While development on the South Side has been on a pause for the past decade, Kiser Group’s partner Noah Birk said it’s only in Bronzeville where developers, particularly from out-of-state, are coming to build small-unit multifamily properties that yield higher capitalization rates, a measure of return on assets, compared with the rest of the nation.“Landlords that we talk to every day are having zero problem putting tenants in,” said Birk. “There’s definitely people that want to be in the area, particularly in nicely rehab places.”Cap rates for multifamily properties were in the mid-8 percent range, higher than the average of 5 percent across the country last year, according to Marcus and Millichap.Money trickling into the area means more retail and large developments, such as the $3.8 billion Bronzeville Lakefront project, a 100-acre mixed-use development with apartments, townhomes, hotels, and a life science campus, planned for completion by 2041.Multibillion-dollar Project\nIt’s one of three multibillion-dollar projects approved by the Chicago City Council, with the construction of infrastructure scheduled to begin this fall on the first phase, developed by GRIT Chicago composed of Farpoint Development, Loop Capital, Draper & Kramer, Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives, McLaurin Development, and Bronzeville Community Development Partnership.Built on the former Michael Reese Hospital site, the project, built from the ground up, can create synergies between commercial, residential buildings, and landscaping – becoming the next “Fulton Market,’’ the development in the former meatpacking district that has been the bright spot downtown, said Eric Helfand, principal at Farpoint.“When we think of building large office towers in Fulton Market over a decade ago, people would’ve said, ‘What are you talking about?’,” Helfand said. “I think of it in the same construct as Bronzeville Lakefront. You have to be a little bit of a visionary to understand what the opportunities are.”From planning how to build road grids that are efficient for cars and pedestrians to developing district-wide infrastructure, the Bronzeville projects are significantly different from building at Fulton Market, a densely populated area in the city filled with bars, restaurants, tech and life science companies.The $600 million first phase, expected to be completed in 2024, will develop the site with a 40,000-square-foot community center, as a life science campus focused on health and biomedical technology, and an innovation center of more than 500,000 square feet of office and lab space.The project’s $3 billion second phase, encompassing 6.8 million square feet, is expected to include more medical research facilities, offices, retail, and residential units.Other major developments in Bronzeville include 43 Green, a $100 million project with 99 residential units and more than 5,000 square feet of retail space, which broke ground last month.Further south at 11444 South Halsted Street, a long-vacant former strip mall is being transformed into a mixed-use complex. Dubbed The Morgan Park Commons, the development will include 250 rental units, 140 single-family homes, and up to 20,000 square feet of retail space.“Bronzeville is an up-and-coming neighborhood, but it’s dead at night when businesses close,” said Kelly, adding residential developments, mom-and-pop stores, and big-box stores are sure to transform the area.“There’s so many new things coming up. It’s going to be a completely different look by this time next year.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",11444 South Halsted Street,"Felicia Kelly, a"," restaurant owner in Chicago’s historic Bronzeville district, is sure the South Side community’s revival is here to stay after development was stalled for more than a decade by the financial crisis and rising crime.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/02/16/chicago-betting-bronzeville-revival-is-here-to-stay/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Felicia Kelly, a</a> restaurant owner in Chicago’s historic Bronzeville district, is sure the South Side community’s revival is here to stay after development was stalled for more than a decade by the financial crisis and rising crime.","11444 South Halsted Street Chicago, IL","11444 S Halsted St, Chicago, IL 60628, USA","(41.6864094, -87.6440077, 0.0)",41.6864094,-87.6440077,0.0,2022

Once the deal is finalized, Snap will move from its leased space at 648 N Clark Street in River North, Crain’s Chicago Business reported.In addition to Snap, Chicago-based transportation logistics provider MoLo Solutions is looking to almost triple its office space with a new lease at 167 N Green. The company, which currently leases 33,000 square feet at 120 N Racine Avenue, is nearing a lease of 93,000 square feet in the new Fulton Market district building.Even before Snap and MoLo finalize their leases, the building at 167 N Green is close to being 70 percent leased. It includes such tenants as CCC Information Services, Kroll, Foxtrot Market, Jet Support Services and WeWork.Many companies have been migrating to Fulton Market, including Kimberly-Clark, TikTok, Hazel Technologies and Calamos Investments. They have followed the lead of other larger corporations like Google, McDonald’s and Glassdoor.The space Snap is looking to lease is on the 16th and 17th floors of 127 N Green and includes a 2,000-square-foot outdoor deck. MoLo is also looking to lease space that would span two floors in the building. The top floor of the building is also equipped with a full-sized basketball court that can be converted into a meeting space.Fulton Market has been experiencing such a boom in commercial and residential development that city officials are considering building a new Metra station there to accommodate the increased amount of commuter traffic.[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",167 N Green Street,The parent company, of popular social media app Snapchat is planning a move in Chicago that would double the amount of office space it currently holds.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/09/28/snapchat-parent-company-eyes-fulton-market-for-new-office-space/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The parent company</a> of popular social media app Snapchat is planning a move in Chicago that would double the amount of office space it currently holds.","167 N Green Street Chicago, IL","167 N Green St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8851564, -87.6484878, 0.0)",41.8851564,-87.6484878,0.0,2021

The seller was Broadshore Capital Partners of Los Angeles.Albion paid the equivalent of $228,000 per unit, Albion President Jason Koehn said. The sale netted a solid return for Broadshore, which acquired the property through a predecessor company that spent $97 million for it in 2014. The property was valued at $115.8 million in October 2019 and Albion plans to spend about $30 million to renovate the complex with new kitchens, bathrooms, flooring and amenities.Albion financed the purchase with a senior loan from Wells Fargo and mezzanine financing from Walton Street Capital. Koehn wouldn’t say how much Albion borrowed, saying only that it covers about 65 percent of the acquisition and renovation costs.The sale topped the $137 million that a fund managed by Turner Impact Capital paid in January for the 1,155-unit Ellyn Crossing complex in Glendale Heights.“If I could have owned 10 Bourbon Squares I would have done so,” Broadshore CEO Brad Howe told The Real Deal. “It’s a really unique asset and an established, workforce-oriented property.”Howe said the unit’s sizes, more than 1,000 square feet, are up to a quarter larger than many of the new apartment units under development in the area. A “significant renovation” of the property’s common areas and units over the eight years of Broadshore’s ownership helped enhance its cash flow, he said, declining to reveal how much was spent on the upgrades.“We accomplished our business plan,” Howe said. “We generated a significant growth in the property’s income and accomplished the goal of our client,” an investor whom he declined to identify.\nThe property is about four miles northeast of another one that the company owns in Palatine, Albion on Northwest, formerly known as Birchwood on Sterling. Albion paid more than $100 million for that complex last September.[CCB] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",500 E Constitution Drive,An apartment complex," in Palatine, about 16 miles northwest of O’Hare Airport, sold for almost $140 million, a record for the Chicago suburbs.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/07/12/palatine-apartment-complex-sells-for-suburban-record-140m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">An apartment complex</a> in Palatine, about 16 miles northwest of O’Hare Airport, sold for almost $140 million, a record for the Chicago suburbs.","500 E Constitution Drive Chicago, IL","500 E Constitution Dr, Palatine, IL 60074, USA","(42.150875, -88.029332, 0.0)",42.150875,-88.029332,0.0,2022

It could also fetch the highest total price for a Downtown office building in more than two years, according to the report.McDonald’s moved its headquarters from Oak Brook to the nine-story building in June 2018. Its long-term lease of 85 percent of the building runs through July 2033.Though investment sales have lagged in most other parts of the city, interest in Fulton Market has remained high, allowing the developers that helped transform the former meatpacking district.Sterling Bay sold its own headquarters on the western edge of Fulton Market at 1330 West Fulton Street $168 million in August amid plans to relocate to the new building it was constructing at 333 North Green Street.Sterling Bay also lured Google to Fulton Market with the development of its Midwest headquarters at 1330 West Fulton Market.

Hendrickson with the North Riverside Plaza in Riverside and Elmhurst Crossing in Elmhurst (Brixmor, LinkedIn)New York investment firm Brixmor Property Group raised its bet on Chicago-area shopping centers, picking one up for $75 million and another right next to a mall that faced foreclosure last year.Brixmor bought the Elmhurst Crossing and North Riverside Plaza shopping centers from Montreal-based Federal Construction, the longtime owner of both properties.Brixmor spent $75.1 million on Elmhurst Crossing, or about $216 per square foot for the Whole Foods-anchored property at the northwest corner of Route 83 and St. Charles Road, DuPage County records show.The North Riverside property’s sale price hasn’t been posted in public records yet. Assuming the REIT paid an identical price per square foot as it did on Elmhurst, the North Riverside property would have cost $83 million, though it had more vacant space than the Elmhurst property at the time of the sale. Also potentially depressing the value is the property’s neighbor, the North Riverside Park Mall, which has been on the verge of foreclosure since last year. Brixmor’s recently purchased North Riverside property was mortgaged for $52 million in 2014, public records show.The deals represent a move deeper into the Chicago market for Brixmor, which just purchased another Whole Foods-anchored retail strip called Ravinia Plaza in Orland Park, paying $26 million at $257 per square foot in February. It also is in the midst of a $21 million overhaul of Tinley Park Plaza in the southern suburb of Tinley Park that includes demolition of 87,000 square feet and building 66,000 square feet of new space.The firm is leaning further into the market while grocery-anchored retail across the country is performing well. The asset class has been given a boost despite e-commerce making inroads during the pandemic.In Chicago’s North Mayfair neighborhood, the Sterling Organization paid $18.2 million, or $208 per square feet in March to buy the Jewel Osco-anchored North Mayfair Commons from Canada’s Sun Life Assurance. Prices have moved up since December, when North American Real Estate paid $30 million, or $180 per square foot, for a suburban strip mall anchored by Jewel in suburban Glen Ellyn.In addition to Whole Foods, Elmhurst Crossing is anchored by Kohl’s, At Home and Petco, with leases to restaurants Portillo’s and Chick-Fil-A as well as Bath & Body Works, Wells Fargo and Pure Hockey. It is fully leased except for a single vacant 2,400-square-foot unit, Brixmor said.The North Riverside property is anchored by Kohl’s, Burlington, Best Buy, Petco, Michael’s and a new grocery under construction, with retail and dining leases to Chick-Fil-A, Chili’s and T-Mobile, as well. It has three vacant spaces totaling 25,000 square feet, Brixmor said.Mid-America Real Estate brokers Ben Wineman and Kathryn Sugrue represented the seller.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",83 and St. Charles Road,New York investment," firm Brixmor Property Group raised its bet on Chicago-area shopping centers, picking one up for $75 million and another right next to a mall that faced foreclosure last year.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/04/25/brixmor-raises-bet-on-chicago-area-retail-by-more-than-100m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">New York investment</a> firm Brixmor Property Group raised its bet on Chicago-area shopping centers, picking one up for $75 million and another right next to a mall that faced foreclosure last year.","83 and St. Charles Road Chicago, IL","IL-83 & St Charles Rd, Elmhurst, IL 60126, USA","(41.8902352, -87.9619183, 0.0)",41.8902352,-87.9619183,0.0,2022

After being traded to the New York Jets in 2015, Marshall listed the home for $6 million, but saw no takers.The price has been reduced multiple times since, and was even listed as a rental asking $20,000 per month.The listing for the four-bedroom, four-bathroom home boasts of it’s 20-foot-ceilings and 6,400-square feet spread out over four floors, not to mention more 2,000 square feet of outdoor space including a rooftop deck with views of Millennium Park and Lake Michigan.The historic Montgomery Ward building was constructed in 1898.The Chicago area has seen a surge in luxury home sales this year. An unfinished penthouse at the Ritz-Carlton Residences on Michigan Avenue sold for $8 million in June, the seventh Chicago-area deal this year to reach that number.JDL Development’s 9 West Walton condo building has dominated the list of most expensive home sales recently, led by billionaire Ken Griffin’s record-shattering $59 million purchase of a four-story penthouse atop the building last year.A yet-to-be built, two-story condo in Magellan Development’s unfinished Vista Tower could join Griffin’s home among the most expensive ever.

District officials removed him from his post while keeping him on the CPS payroll, citing the inspector’s report in its decision.Beyer denied Schuler’s accusations and sued the Chicago Board of Education in an attempt to get his job back, calling the report’s findings “extremely inaccurate.” The lawsuit is ongoing.But earlier this month, Chicago Public Schools suspended his salary, Beyer said. That’s when he began working for Giglio-Vakos, one of four neighbors on his West Town block who also happen to be high-producing real estate brokers.“I have to earn money for my family, and given the timeframe of the lawsuit, I’m not going to hold my breath,” Beyer said. “And quite frankly I’ve been considering a new career because I’ve gotten a bit tired of education, especially considering my experience.”Beyer was impressed by the “aggressive” work of Giglio-Vakos’ team, and by Compass’ embrace of new broker technology, he said. He enrolled in a 90-hour class with the Chicago Association of Realtors to get his license and attended a Compass orientation Monday.Giglio-Vakos said she welcomed Beyer’s experience in education.“Schools are a big part of many people’s decisions in looking to buy or sell,” Giglio-Vakos said. “He saw from the very beginning that he could bring that aspect to the table … it’s hugely valuable.”Giglio-Vakos launched Team MVP in 2013. The group worked under the Jameson Sotheby brand until Compass came to Chicago in late 2017, and Giglio-Vakos was one of the first local brokers to jump to the new firm.Her team now lists condos, townhomes and houses ranging from $125,000 to $2 million, mostly focusing on newly-built homes. Last year, Team MVP racked up about $102 million in sales volume.Beyer joined this month, but he began considering the career switch shortly after his dismissal last year, he said.“Frankly, the idea of going to another school after my experience working at CPS does not really appeal to me,” Beyer said, adding that he was looking for “some flexibility” after a career of 12-hour days and working on weekends.Earlier this year, the educator began reaching out to some of his other neighbors in the 1800 block of West Erie Street, including Gary Lucido of Lucid Realty and Ivona Kutermankiewicz of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices KoenigRubloff. He cited a side-interest in architecture as part of the reason he drifted into the industry, adding he earned a master’s degree in art history from the University of Illinois at Chicago.Beyer also launched a venture called “Live & Learn: Home & School Specialists,” a consulting firm to help parents search for homes “in tandem” with scouting out schools, he said.“I’m a hard worker and I know a lot of people, so why not?” Beyer said. “I’ve always been one of those geeks who goes on Zillow and looks around at stuff for fun, so it wasn’t alien to me at all.”If Beyer wins his lawsuit and the school district reverses its decision, he would return to his position as principal at Ogden but would continue his real estate practice “on the side,” he said.Representatives of Chicago Public Schools and the inspector general’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1800 block of West Erie Street,Months after he was," knocked off his perch as principal at a high-profile public elementary school, Michael Beyer found a new calling.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/06/25/why-not-ousted-cps-principal-dives-into-new-life-as-compass-broker/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Months after he was</a> knocked off his perch as principal at a high-profile public elementary school, Michael Beyer found a new calling.","1800 block of West Erie Street Chicago, IL","1800 W Erie St, Chicago, IL 60622, USA","(41.8934631, -87.6723296, 0.0)",41.8934631,-87.6723296,0.0,2019

Thompson Center & Michael Reschke (Getty Images, iStock)The Harry Houdini of Chicago real estate is back in the spotlight.Veteran Chicago developer Michael Reschke, who earned the moniker from Crain’s in 1999 for his ability to survive precarious financial situations, is taking on what may be his biggest gamble yet in buying the James. R. Thompson Center, Crain’s reported. He’s buying it from the state and plans to update the building’s offices and potentially even convert the upper floors into a hotel.“A lot of people have questioned whether I have a screw loose or something,” Reschke told Crain’s. Despite record vacancy rates, however, “it’s a very rational — I think — well thought-out project if you just study the project and what you’re working with.”Reschke began making a name for himself in the 1980s by building multi-billion dollar buildings. Reschke’s Prime Group developed a 51-story tower at 77 West Wacker Drive that served as the corporate headquarters for R.R. Donnelley and United Airlines.Reschke also transformed parts of LaSalle Street with the purchase of an outdated office building at 11 South LaSalle, which he turned into the Residence Inn Chicago Downtown. He also spent almost $400 million renovating the building, at 208 South LaSalle Street, and converted the first 12 floors into the JW Marriott Chicago. He was also hired to develop an almost $200 million 388-room hotel at 150 East Ontario Street in Streeterville.Reschke is also known for his ability to avoid loan trouble by refinancing properties through public securities markets and negotiations with lenders.“The people that are having problems today are maybe the hotels that are average performers or even weak performers,” Reschke told Crain’s in February. “Assets that really were stellar pre-COVID are still desirable investment vehicles for institutions.”[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",77 West Wacker Drive,The Harry Houdini of, Chicago real estate is back in the spotlight.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/12/20/harry-houdini-of-chicago-real-estate-in-spotlight-with-thompson-center-deal/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Harry Houdini of</a> Chicago real estate is back in the spotlight.","77 West Wacker Drive Chicago, IL","77 W Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL 60601, USA","(41.8864228, -87.6307475, 0.0)",41.8864228,-87.6307475,0.0,2021

(Getty, Obama)As construction crews on Monday began preliminary work on the $700 million Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park, a local advocacy group was prepping for another run at stopping it.Protect Our Parks said it would appeal a federal court judge’s decision to deny its emergency request to halt construction. The group is among several that have battled the Obama Foundation in court to move the complex two miles away to Washington Park.Protect Our Parks and other neighborhood organizations want the center built farther south because they believe it will better bolster a needier area with jobs and development, and will not impact Dusable Lake Shore Drive or eat up Lake Michigan parkland. And while the long-awaited Obama Center project has drawn the attention of developers and investors to the South Side, Jackson Park neighbors fear it will bring more gentrification and price hikes that will squeeze them out of their homes.On Aug. 6, U.S. District Judge John Blakely denied a preliminary injunction to stop the project, following oral arguments in July. He did not issue an opinion, but the ruling allowed the Obama Foundation to close on its purchase Friday of 19.5 acres in the 550-acre park. It also allowed for work to begin. On Monday, construction crews started to take apart the Jackson Park football field to make way for roadway infrastructure.Richard Epstein, the attorney representing Protect Our Parks, called the ruling “a very bad setback,” but added, “it’s not a final judgment.”Epstein said he will file an appeal and will continue to prepare arguments for a separate lawsuit claiming the Obama Foundation, which is funding much of the center, failed to do full federal reviews of other potential sites.That lawsuit would challenge a years-long federal review of the project because Jackson Park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The review, completed in February, noted the construction and surrounding road repairs would not have a significant impact on the area. It represented a major victory toward construction of the center.Valerie Jarrett, president of the Obama Foundation and a former senior adviser to President Obama, called Blakely’s ruling “a major victory that has been years in the making.” She added, “we are officially able to begin delivering on our commitment to Chicago’s South Side.”The Obama Center, which is not an official presidential library, will take about four years to develop its four buildings.Epstein said his next court effort will be aimed at keeping construction crews from taking down hundreds of trees in Jackson Park beginning in September. Jarrett said last month that only 350 trees would be taken down — the foundation said many were small or diseased — but Epstein thinks it’s more like 800.Epstein also believes construction will create traffic jams and rerouting headaches that will bring more opponents out. And though he concedes he’s got a tough battle ahead — typically judges don’t stop projects once they’ve been started — he said he will keep fighting.“There are so many things wrong with this park, even if we lose one battle, there are still plenty ahead,” he said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",700 million Obama Presidential Center,As construction," crews on Monday began preliminary work on the $700 million Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park, a local advocacy group was prepping for another run at stopping it.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/08/16/work-begins-at-700m-obama-center-but-opponents-say-fight-isnt-over/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">As construction</a> crews on Monday began preliminary work on the $700 million Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park, a local advocacy group was prepping for another run at stopping it.","700 million Obama Presidential Center Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2021

That one, on nearby Church Street, sold for $2.5 million and also became a private residence. Pritzker, who paid $2.25 million for the home in 2012 paid for renovations, most likely took a loss on the sale.Tawani sold two other properties in 2019.

The entire penthouse level, one of two amenity decks in the 191-unit building, is also wrapped in “smart windows” that automatically dim based on sunlight conditions.Studios start at $2,075.Property Markets Group | L Logan Square | A train on the roofA year after Property Markets Group opened its 120-unit apartment building at 2211 North Milwaukee Avenue, the New York-based firm spent $200,000 to buy a an “L” car from the CTA and retrofit it on its rooftop amenity deck. The firm even changed the name of the building, originally called “X Logan Square,” to highlight the new feature.“It’s the most popular amenity we have in the portfolio,” Property Markets Group principal Noah Gottlieb said of the car. “It’s designed for gathering with friends and all social occasions.”The building is completely leased, according to its website.Optima, Inc. | Optima Signature | A 40-yard dash trackOptima Signature’s basketball courtFitness centers come standard in most new residential high-rises, but few developers can lay claim to a full-size basketball court. The 57-story Optima Signature, which opened last year at 220 East Illinois Street in Streeterville, also has a children’s playground, bocce and squash courts, a “cold-plunge shower” and three saunas. More intense competitors can time themselves on a 40-yard dash track.One-bedroom apartments start at $2,950.F&F Realty and Fifield Realty Co. | 727 West Madison | The “Sky Lounge”When Fifield and F&F started leasing apartments this month for the 492-unit tower it’s finishing at 727 West Madison Street at the entrance to the West Loop, prospective tenants got a simple proposition: hang out on the top floor of the tallest building in the neighborhood.The owners haven’t announced any features or programming for its “sky lounge,” but it’s hired Studio K, the interior designer for restaurants including Girl & the Goat, to fill in the details.Studios start at $1,735.Property Markets Group | X Chicago | “Media beds”X Chicago’s “media beds”The amenity deck at X Chicago, 710 West 14th Street, invites residents to crawl into bed and stare up at a pair of ceiling-mounted TVs. The 100-unit apartment complex, completed earlier this year by Property Markets Group, also includes a co-working space, “outdoor amphitheater,” fire pit and “industrial kitchen,” according to listings. Studios start at $1,425.Sterling Bay | 210 North Carpenter | An office swimming poolResidential developers aren’t the only ones under pressure to outfit their buildings with extravagant lounge-and-leisure spaces. Eyeing a potential Google lease in its new 12-story Fulton Market complex, Sterling Bay hired Solomon Cordwell Buenz to design an amenity deck worthy of Silicon Valley.The floor will include a “big fitness component” with a yoga studio and a pool big enough for employees to swim laps during their lunch breaks, SCB design principal Jay Longo said.The building will also boast a “huge outdoor roof deck” with barbecue pits and lawn bocce courts, some of the same features showing up on apartment tower rooftops around the city, Longo said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",720 South Wells Street,There’s a “namaste," nook” for private yoga lessons, a single-stall hair salon and a grill deck with rain-resistant widescreen TVs suspended above each grate.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/10/23/the-art-of-selling-a-unit-tween-rooms-and-sky-lounges-are-the-latest-salvos-in-the-amenity-wars/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">There’s a “namaste</a> nook” for private yoga lessons, a single-stall hair salon and a grill deck with rain-resistant widescreen TVs suspended above each grate.","720 South Wells Street Chicago, IL","720 S Wells St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8725605, -87.6339106, 0.0)",41.8725605,-87.6339106,0.0,2018

Chicago developer DL3 Realty signed Blue Cross to a 10-year lease in 2019 for the 128,000-square-foot store and subsequently paid $250,000 to buy the property from Target.DL3 managing partner Leon Walker said the firm invested about $10 million to renovate the Blue Door Neighborhood Center and office building early this year. Property records show DL3 refinanced the property with a nearly $5 million loan in July 2020.More than $1.3 million is expected to be generated as annual net income from the building, according to Jones Lang LaSalle that represented DL3.Beitel Group specializes in residential and retail projects. Most recently, the group filed plans to build a 12-story, 96-unit residential building in Mott Haven in the Bronx.DL3’s Walker said in a statement that he hopes the sale will be an example of the strong return other developers can generate if they invest into areas that have been disinvested. Bringing in investment in the South and North Side communities has been one of Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot’s priorities. The city announced a development of mixed-use real estate that would include more than 215 units and 40,000 square feet of commercial space for South Chicago, North Lawndale, Bronzeville and New City.[Crain’s] — Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",11840 South Marshfield Avenue,A revamped former, Target store that was converted to a Blue Cross & Blue Shield multipurpose center in Chicago’s South Side is paying off for developer DL3.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/09/28/blue-cross-blue-shield-multipurpose-center-in-south-side-fetches-20m-after-revamping-former-target-building/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A revamped former</a> Target store that was converted to a Blue Cross & Blue Shield multipurpose center in Chicago’s South Side is paying off for developer DL3.","11840 South Marshfield Avenue Chicago, IL","11840 S Marshfield Ave, Chicago, IL 60643, USA","(41.6784525, -87.6647548, 0.0)",41.6784525,-87.6647548,0.0,2021

Green StreetThe Chicago office market has been hammered by the pandemic, but one local convenience store company is eyeing a bigger headquarters in Fulton Market.Foxtrot Market is nearing a deal to ink a 30,000-square-foot lease at the massive 167 N. Green Street, according to Crain’s. Shapack Partners and Focus own the 750,000-square-foot building, which opened last year and counts WeWork and CCC Information Services among its tenants.The new office space would be nearly four times the size of Foxtrot’s current HQ at 440 N. Wells Street in River North, according to the report. The company, which runs upscale shops, recently announced it had closed a $42 million Series B funding round, and would be adding stores. Foxtrot, led by CEO and co-founder Michael LaVitola, said it would double its store count to 19, adding four more locations in Chicago, along with one in Dallas and Washington, D.C., the Chicago Tribune has reported.Foxtrot’s pending deal at 167 Green Street would also include a retail location in the 17-story building, according to Crain’s. In July, CCC, which provides software to process auto insurance claims, said it would scale back its space at the complex because of Covid, from 180,000 square feet to 125,000 square feet. WeWork inked a deal for 140,000 square feet in April 2019.If the Foxtrot lease closes, it would be good news for the Chicago office market, which has been whipsawed by the virus. A recent CBRE report showed downtown office vacancy ballooned to 15.5 percent, a figure that could rise to 20 percent if under-construction projects don’t immediately sign tenants once work is completed.

Howard St. (Cordogan Clark/49th Ward Office, Getty, Housing 4 All)Rogers Park is considering a new mid-rise apartment building that will offer its residents a convenient public transportation option.Development group Housing For All is proposing the $30 million, six-story complex with 110 units and ground-floor retail, Block Club Chicago reported. The development will replace a strip of retail and a storage facility at the intersection of West Howard and North Paulina streets, across from the Red Line.Its proximity to the Howard Street Red Line stop makes it an ideal location for high density housing, and makes it an attractive location for potential tenants.The plan would help revitalize a neighborhood that has been plagued by violence and disinvestment. It calls for 16 studio apartments, 24 one-bedroom, 42 two-bedroom and 28 three-bedroom units. Of the 110 units, 88 will be reserved for households that make 60 percent or less of the area median income — about $43,800 for a single-person household — and the remaining 22 units will be reserved for households making 30 percent of the area median income or lower.The 15,000 square feet of ground-floor retail would replace a single-story retail property at 1646-1660 West Howard Street that is currently home to a currency exchange, Post Office and restaurant.The mostly vacant, historic Werner Bros. Storage building at 7613 North Paulina Street, which was built in 1921, will have to be demolished. Since the building is listed as an “orange-rated” property on the city’s historical survey, the city has to review the building and the plans before approving a demolition permit. As is, it cannot be redeveloped for residential purposes due to ceiling height requirements.The project still requires funding approval, but work could begin later next year in late 2023, and be ready for residents by 2025, according to the developer.\nRezoning will not be necessary to move the project forward, but the city will require “planned development” due to its size.\nRead more\n\n Interfaith’s West Side permit beefs up housing for homeless \n Jonathan Rose adds $63M to Chicago affordable housing play \n CTA’s $2.3B Red Line expansion could be catalyst for South Chicago development— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1660 W.

The development would have included a new city park and three detention ponds.Residents were worried about increased traffic on a 100-foot access road that would connect the southern edge of the development to Klein Road to the east, as well as flooding and the loss of farmland. Pulte Homes made several changes to the proposal to comply with zoning and planning requirements, according to West Chicago Director of Community Development Tom Dabareiner.Nevertheless, the city’s development committee voted against the project last week. That decision came after the Plan Commission unanimously threw its support behind it in March.Pulte has two other developments in the works in suburban Chicago, a 27-lot project in Bartlett and an 84-lot done in an unincorporated area near West Chicago, according to the Daily Herald.[Daily Herald] — Miranda DavisAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",59 and Klein Road,"Pulte Homes, the"," nation’s No. 3 homebuilder, scrapped plans for a 266-unit project in West Chicago amid a storm of local criticism – two months after it had been approved by the city’s Plan Commission.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/05/17/pulte-scraps-suburban-chicago-subdivision-after-local-pushback/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Pulte Homes, the</a> nation’s No. 3 homebuilder, scrapped plans for a 266-unit project in West Chicago amid a storm of local criticism – two months after it had been approved by the city’s Plan Commission.","59 and Klein Road Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2022

Final approval is expected at that meeting.Top Hospitality first proposed building the hotels simultaneously in 2020. Now it plans to begin work on the Residence Inn this fall and build the Courtyard hotel beginning in the spring of 2024. Both will have a pool, fitness center and lobby bar.The village will invest more than $2 million to extend water and sewer lines west along 179th Street to serve the hotels. The village said the extension in the area, which has about 30 acres of vacant land, could also encourage future development.The hotels, and another 108-room Holiday Inn rising at 18320 North Creek Drive, will add to 10 hotels in Tinley Park.

Streeterville and River North led the largest total in that quarter at 1,550 units, followed by the Loop at 1,150.

11:00 AM","It was a week of ups and downs for Curt Bailey and Related Midwest, one of the most active and well-capitalized development firms in Chicago.","[""Curt Bailey and\xa0The 78It was a week of ups and downs for Curt Bailey and Related Midwest, one of the most active and well-capitalized development firms in Chicago.On Tuesday, the company learned The 78, its $7 billion “new neighborhood” planned in the South Loop, won’t be the next home of Amazon’s vaunted HQ2, even though it made the company’s final round of consideration. But two days later, the massive project scored approval from the Chicago Plan Commission, putting it on track for its goal to develop up to 6 million square feet on the site by 2022.In part one of a two-part sit-down with The Real Deal, Bailey walked through the first phase of The 78’s construction, and discussed how the company will attract residents and employees to what’s now a 62-acre marsh on the South Branch of the Chicago River. He also talked through Related’s strategy of “operating on the fringes of real estate” to acquire properties with problematic histories.He gave an update on 400 North Lake Shore Drive, where his team is moving forward with a revised plan after the first proposal was shot down by Alderman Brendan Reilly. And he explained why he thinks the current building cycle won’t hit a wall anytime soon, but instead might taper off as construction becomes more expensive.During part two, The Real Deal will ask Bailey about One Bennett Park, Fulton Market and who’s buying condos in Chicago.The following conversation has been edited for length.The 78The last time we spoke was in June, it was fresh off your first public meeting on The 78 …Which was very successful. You rarely leave an initial meeting, especially for a project of that size and scope, and have a feel like that about it. There was so much positive reinforcement that we felt extremely positive about our prospects for moving forward under the parameters that we presented, without any major changes. And that is a function of what we really do well here, which is spending a lot of time thinking about our architecture design, the creation of place, materiality, your sensory perception of where you are, your experience of when you visit someplace. And we also got great ideas and thoughts for people who live there and say, “What about this?” We love to hear those things, and many times we make actual changes to address that feedback, whether it’s from the city or the alderman. It’s extremely valuable and how you get to the creation of a great place.So, keeping in mind that five months may not be a very long time in a project of this scale, can you tell me what’s changed since then? Have any of the ideas brought up during the public meeting been applied to the plan?What I think we’ve done since that time is move forward on every single big part of the program. And the good news is that we have gotten an affirmation of all those things. The Wells-Wentworth [connector] is fully engineered and about to begin. And in a couple months you’ll see work happening out there on that.And when is that supposed to be finished?I believe it’s the beginning of 2020.And at that point, the plan is to start building along that Wells-Wentworth corridor, and go out from there?Yeah, it’s infrastructure and buildings. The buildings will depend on where we are in the market, and the infrastructure will be ongoing. But think about how incredible that will be to drive right down Wells Street, through 62 acres to Downtown Chicago. I think part of the reason the area has sat fallow for so long is that it’s very hard to see it today. You’re traveling fast on Roosevelt Road and you’re 40 feet above it, you can’t see it from Clark Street because there’s a wall, and there are the Metra trains at the southern part of the site. So unless you’re on the river, you really don’t see the site. But when you drive through it, you’ll see the size and scope and proximate nature of all these big successful buildings all around it.Now the Amazon HQ2 guessing game is officially over, can you tell me how close the 78 was to being chosen? Can you confirm they came back in August for a second look at the site?Yes, they made a second visit to our site in the end of August, and the feedback we received was that our site was a top-five site in the country. And so what I would take from that exercise is that of 238 municipalities, you probably had close to 1,000 sites combined, and we were top five. That makes me feel pretty good about our prospects moving forward on The 78 for other companies. Other companies will understand the value of what we can provide there, and what Chicago can provide with access to all these really smart young people who want to live in the city. So I won’t say it wasn’t a disappointment, but the overall takeaway was that we were extremely high in the running for this, and that’s a very positive thing.So when you’re looking at turning a barren expanse of land into a whole new community, where do you start? Walk me through the sequence of building a neighborhood from scratch.We’ve taken a lot of guidepoints from several developments. One is King’s Cross in London, done by our sister company Argent Related, and the other is Hudson Yards in New York, done by our partners at Related. The delivery of Phase One is critically important. When you move into your office building or residential building, it’s got to be a great place to live on day one. So we need to do a number of infrastructure moves before we open a building. And that means the seven-acre park, it means a lot of riverfront, it means the infrastructure connectivity of 15th Street and Wells, so we want those things to deliver in a Phase One deployment. It can be as small as 3 million square feet and large as 6 million square feet. But we want it to be a great place from day one. That’s for the DPI [University of Illinois Discovery Partners Institute] when they open their doors…DPI would be part of that first phase?Yeah. They want to move very fast. They already have a great ongoing program on Wacker Drive, they’re too big for their existing space, and so they want to move quickly. And we want to be very careful about continuing to curate a great place, so we’re looking at how we’re blocking construction from the rest of the site, so you can live there even though some cranes will be around. All those things are going to be very important, and we’re taking lessons from other places that have already done it.So the key will be having all that recreational space in place before any buildings open.A hundred percent. We’re very focused on this. If you want a big office space and you want to be in a high-rise in Downtown Chicago, I’m not going to be able to compete. But if you want office space with enormous floor plates and connectivity within the building and an incredible environment around you where you can go out one door of your building and you have a seven-acre park, and the other door brings you to the riverfront with a half-mile of this 100-foot-wide riverwalk, we’re the act. So we’re trying to build out those things and create that environment, but also tell that story that people can understand and see.Is there a year you’re targeting for the delivery of Phase One?If I had to peg it, I’d say 2022. Maybe 2023.Last month, Alderman Reilly rejected Related’s proposal for 400 North Lake Shore Drive. Where does that project stand now?I think we’re excited to keep moving through the review process as soon as we can, probably at the beginning of next year. We have revised our plan, and we have a spectacular two-building plan designed by Dave Childs that will be a signature piece of the Chicago landscape forever. They’re beautifully designed buildings with terracotta on the outside, something that hasn’t been done in Chicago in close to 100 years. It will be a singularly beautiful place to live, and the location just can’t be duplicated. We love the location, and we look forward to working with the alderman and the neighbors to produce an incredible development.By my count, there are four of these campus-sized mega-developments being planned in the city right now, between The 78, Lincoln Yards, the Tribune River District\xa0and the Michael Reese Hospital redevelopment.\xa0 Why are they all happening at once? Why now?I think it’s a unique set of circumstances that are bringing all these pieces to the market at once. The viability of them became much more clear with a positive real estate market, and the lack of available land. The knock on Chicago has been that there’s always another parking lot to build on, as opposed to New York, which has, like, no available land. But once all those parking lots go away, it becomes much more difficult to find pieces of land to build on. And that’s what we’re getting. If you look at what the city looked like 15 years ago with the availability of parcels compared to today, there really aren’t many left. And it’s more difficult to build.Land is our material. If we were making cars, we would need steel and rubber. But we’re building buildings, and we need land. And you look around, and there’s not a whole lot of land left. So then you look around and say, “Well there’s a big piece of land at the Tribune site.” And people have been talking about the Finkl site for years. People have been talking about [The 78] site for years. And for political and different reasons, they never got developed.So now developers have no choice but to reach for the higher fruit on the tree.Yeah, because the material isn’t there anymore, and so you start to try and figure out how you can get to those bigger ones. That’s why I think there are a number of these big projects out there. They won’t all get done. It’s a big lift. It takes a confluence of a lot of different things.Let’s talk more about the sites that Related has chosen for its big projects since you’ve been with the company [2008]. You have this 62-acre stretch of barren land with a sordid political history. You have a huge, deteriorating public housing complex in the Lathrop Homes whose future was a matter of real controversy. You have an 80-foot hole in the ground at 400 North Lake Shore that’s become this great symbol of failure. 111 West Wacker was not in good shape when Related took over in 2011. Is it on purpose that Related dives head-first into sites with such hardscrabble reputations, or just a coincidence?You’re forgetting about the land we’re building One Bennett Park on, which was another purchase from banks. We also took over three condo buildings in the South Loop during the downturn, rebranded them as Related, put $25 million into their common areas and units, and made those great buildings. So I think it’s more about taking advantage of the downturn to make great real estate plays. And the ability to see past issues to get to great development opportunities. I mean, you can refer to 400 North Lake Shore Drive as an 80-foot hole in the ground, but it’s also two acres where the river meets the lake. I think it’s one of the best pieces of land in the country. So we got to that through some interesting means. We didn’t buy land, we bought debt. We went through the federal bankruptcy process. So we are willing to operate on the fringes of real estate so we can get to these incredible parcels and do special things on them. So yeah, we don’t do small as well as others. We don’t do easy as well as others. I think, given our history and our level of expertise, we do better when it’s big and complicated.One of the points that keeps coming up in Related’s guiding principles for The 78 is this idea of creating a very inclusive and public and open neighborhood that knits together people from all different walks of life. How do you make that happen? How do you create an entire new neighborhood that’s fully inclusive?It gets back to the fundamental question of, what makes a great place? I can’t think of a great place that isn’t all-inclusive and doesn’t have people from every walk of life going to it. It’s important that you make a place where someone can feel comfortable from every single corner of the city. So that’s what we’re going to create, and the natural advantage of our site is that we’re at the crux between Downtown and the South Side. We’re going to be a bridge between Downtown and Chinatown, and Bridgeport, and Pilsen, and Bronzeville and all those different neighborhoods. We want to take different components of all these parts of the city, and bring them into our site. We want people to come from all over the world, all over the country, all over the region, all over Chicago, every neighborhood. Overall success will be determined by whether it can be a place where tourists want to be, a place where people who live and work there want to be, and a place where people from surrounding neighborhoods want to go. That is extremely hard to do, but it’s the only barometer for success. Think of Millennium Park. Everyone loves Millennium Park. Tourists love it and Chicagoans love it. People who live around there love to go there. And that is what you take lessons from.We recently wrote a feature trying to look at the impact of the affordability pilot zones that were established last year, and during our reporting we heard everything from, “it’s impossible to get anything build inside the pilot zones” to “developers are overreacting, and they can hit the affordability benchmarks if they really want to.” Where do you fall on that question?I think I was the only developer who stood up and supported the [2015 affordability requirements ordinance]. And we continue to support any program for affordable housing in the city of Chicago. I think affordable housing is wildly important for us. It’s one of the key barometers of success for any city in the world, and we will continue to get creative and do whatever we can to deliver affordable housing in Chicago. That being said, cooperation is absolutely key, and everybody from the city to the housing department to the aldermen working together is important to be able to being able to get over these … to build units on these rules, which are important but tough to do sometimes to make the numbers work.Complete the following sentence. Over the next 20 years, whether Chicago remains a broadly affordable city will depend on …I think it clearly will be an affordable city. You look at our competitive cities, and we are in the most affordable city on the housing side of it by a mile. New York, L.A., San Francisco, Boston, D.C. … Chicago is a better city than all of them but New York. It’s bigger, it’s got more culture, it has more interesting things. We are very affordable here in the city.Right, but what can developers and city policymakers do to preserve that, to make sure Chicago’s housing market doesn’t become more like any of those other cities?We won’t. It’s an impossibility. Because we’re able to build at levels that they’re not able to build at. It would take such a sea change for us to become a market priced at those levels. Chicago is a very affordable place to be today, on the grand scale, and I think that will continue to be the case. I think we’ll see price appreciation here on both the rent and and the sales side, but compared against our competitor cities we continue to be an affordable place to live.One obligatory last question: do you see an end in sight for the current building cycle? What signs are you watching most closely to see whether we’re getting to that point?Well, people have been talking about whether we’re in the seventh or the eighth inning or whatever. We’re not looking at people who opine on what inning it is — we look at the numbers. We look at the growth of the population of Downtown Chicago vis-a-vis deliveries, and that gap is widening, not shrinking. And if you look at the vacancy rates in existing buildings — I mean, is there an available built apartment in Chicago right now? There are more people moving into Chicago than we’re delivering units for. So that makes me feel relatively OK about where we are. The ARO is making it tougher to get financed, building prices are going up, the banks are pulling back a bit. It’s getting harder to build a building than it was several years ago, which means you’re going to slow down in production. And as the population continues to go up, there’s going to be less apartments, and you’re going to see rents go up.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",400 North Lake Shore Drive,It was a week of ups," and downs for Curt Bailey and Related Midwest, one of the most active and well-capitalized development firms in Chicago.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/11/16/related-midwests-curt-bailey-on-the-78-pans-for-the-former-spire-site-and-life-after-hq2/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">It was a week of ups</a> and downs for Curt Bailey and Related Midwest, one of the most active and well-capitalized development firms in Chicago.","400 North Lake Shore Drive Chicago, IL","400 N Lake Shore Dr., Chicago, IL 60611, USA","(41.8872509, -87.6145015, 0.0)",41.8872509,-87.6145015,0.0,2018

04:47 PM","Two of Chicago’s most prominent buildings, the St. Regis and Tribune Tower, have delivered multiple luxury dwellings to buyers this past year, but they still won’t release details about the specifics of their sales success.","[""St. Regis and Tribune Tower (iStock)Two of Chicago’s most prominent buildings, the St. Regis and Tribune Tower, have delivered multiple luxury dwellings to buyers this past year, but they still won’t release details about the specifics of their sales success.Crain’s Chicago Business dug through public records to find out exactly how full the luxury towers are. One of the key details Crain’s unearthed was that between the two towers, 202 condos sold for $1 million or more so far in 2021. Compared to the rest of downtown, St. Regis and Tribune Tower sold about 1.4 times as many luxury-priced condos as all of the other buildings combined.“These are big buildings,” Gail Lissner, senior managing director of Integra Realty Resources and a longtime analyst of the downtown condo market, told Crain’s. “They’d be doing big numbers, no matter what.”The St. Regis, which was formerly known as Wanda Vista and later Vista Tower, is located on the south bank of the Chicago River at 363 East Wacker Drive. The 95-story supertall was designed by Studio Gang and features multi-hued glass on the exterior. The 34-story Tribune Tower, located across the river at 435 Michigan Avenue, was converted into condos after the Chicago Tribune left the building in 2018.Two additional residential projects have recently joined Chicago’s downtown market. The 47-story Cirrus in Lakeshore East and 75-story One Chicago tower near Holy Name Cathedral don’t have finished condos to offer to buyers yet.The management team for the St. Regis has been cagey in releasing details about the tower’s sales. Crain’s contacted the team and was told that sales have exceeded expectations and that the tower is “approximately 60 percent sold or under contract.” According to the paper’s research, however, the building’s developer, Magellan, has closed sales for 151 units out of the 353 in the St. Regis tower, putting it at 42 percent sold.While developers rarely publish contracts that aren’t closed, Redfin estimates that Magellan has marked 18 units under contract, which adds 5 percent to the total. The St. Regis units with pending sales include two priced at more than $9 million and another priced above $10 million. Crain’s looked but couldn’t find any records that confirmed an $18.5 million contract for the 10,640-square-foot unit on the entire 71st and 72nd floors that Magellan announced in 2018.As for the Tribune Tower, developers Golub Realty and CIM Group sold 51 of the 151 condos available in the building, or 33 percent. The tower’s sales director Jeanne Martini told Crain’s that the number, with pending contracts added, would be “right at 50 percent.”Martini said seven units went under contract in the week of Nov. 15, in part because a model unit opened a few weeks ago, providing potential buyers the opportunity to experience what the living space is actually like.[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",363 East Wacker Drive,Two of Chicago’s," most prominent buildings, the St. Regis and Tribune Tower, have delivered multiple luxury dwellings to buyers this past year, but they still won’t release details about the specifics of their sales success.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/11/18/crains-study-looks-into-sales-of-luxury-condos-in-prominent-chicago-towers/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Two of Chicago’s</a> most prominent buildings, the St. Regis and Tribune Tower, have delivered multiple luxury dwellings to buyers this past year, but they still won’t release details about the specifics of their sales success.","363 East Wacker Drive Chicago, IL","363 E Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL 60601, USA","(41.8874508, -87.61745979999999, 0.0)",41.8874508,-87.61745979999999,0.0,2021

It’s almost fully leased after the Inspire11 deal, and AmTrust plans to spend $100 million to upgrade most of its Loop buildings.Local officials are prodding investors and Loop landlords, especially on LaSalle Street, where older buildings have struggled with vacancy in recent years, to make similar commitments to update and potentially convert parts of some properties to uses like student housing.Amenity space at 1 North Dearborn will be needed by Inspire11 employees to work in on some days. Its new offices could get crowded if there are days when many of its local employees, which could soon total 400 after a hiring push this year, head into the office.“We were willing to take the bet that on those days, people would go (work) in more general areas of the building,” company CEO Alban Mehmeti told Crain’s.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1 East Wacker Drive,A consulting firm," that’s been on a hiring spree leased space in Chicago’s Loop that doubles its office space, an encouraging sign for landlords in an area that absorbed the brunt of tenant losses during the pandemic.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/04/06/consulting-firm-takes-office-lease-in-loop-expecting-part-time-employees/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A consulting firm</a> that’s been on a hiring spree leased space in Chicago’s Loop that doubles its office space, an encouraging sign for landlords in an area that absorbed the brunt of tenant losses during the pandemic.","1 East Wacker Drive Chicago, IL","1 E Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL 60601, USA","(41.8864632, -87.62751039999999, 0.0)",41.8864632,-87.62751039999999,0.0,2022

The loan from HFF replaces old debt Waterton inherited from Crescent Heights as part of its deal in June.Crescent Heights paid $237 million in 2016 to acquire the 55-story tower at 175 North Harbor Drive from the Florida State Board of Administration, Crain’s reported at the time.Waterton did not disclose how much it paid to pick up the property two years later, but it was “pretty close” to what Crescent Heights had paid, according to Steve Carlson, senior vice president of debt and capital markets at Waterton. Aside from some light renovations to common spaces, the previous owner didn’t add much to the property, Carlson said.Waterton plans to tap existing capital to fund the work, instead of taking out new debt, Carlson added. He did not say whether Waterton would tap its $920 million multifamily investment fund to bankroll the project.The building was completed in 1988, and about 500 of its units have hardly seen any update in the last decade, Carlson said. During the next few years, Waterton plans to replace the appliances, cabinets, countertops, lighting and floors in those units.“There’s a pretty substantial difference between some of the renovated product on the market and where current rents are on un-renovated units,” Carlson said, “so we think there will be a pretty good return on investor capital.”The tower includes a mix of units ranging from studios through three-bedrooms, with rents starting around $1,800 for a 465-square-foot studio, according to its website.At 958 square feet, the average apartment is larger than most competitors’, part of what drew Waterton to the tower in the first place, Carlson said. He did not say how high the firm plans to raise rents post-renovation.Carlson called the Lakeshore East area an “insulated pocket” that could avoid competition for renters among the frenzy of multifamily construction rising from River North and the South Loop. But with Magellan Development Group planning a crop of new high-rises in the area, it may not stay that way for long.After it completes the 101-story Vista Tower next year, Magellan will build four new residential towers, three of them in partnership with Lendlease on opposite ends of the 28-acre neighborhood combining for up to 2,340 units.Waterton plans to hang onto North Harbor Tower for about another four years, Carlson said.The investment firm lists eight Chicago properties in its portfolio, with investments in 13 other states. At the end of last year, Waterton claimed about $4.9 billion in assets.In January, the firm announced that it had bought a controlling share in senior housing operator Pathway to Living, with plans to expand the brand across the country.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",175 North Harbor Drive,One of the city’s, biggest multifamily investment firms is getting ready to spend up to $15 million dollars to refurbish a Lakeshore East apartment high-rise.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/05/30/waterton-to-sink-15m-into-renovations-of-lakeshore-east-apartment-high-rise/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">One of the city’s</a> biggest multifamily investment firms is getting ready to spend up to $15 million dollars to refurbish a Lakeshore East apartment high-rise.","175 North Harbor Drive Chicago, IL","North Harbor Tower, 175 N Harbor Dr, Chicago, IL 60601, USA","(41.8854416, -87.61547829999999, 0.0)",41.8854416,-87.61547829999999,0.0,2019

Xeris’ move also marks another departure from LaSalle Street through the Loop, a corridor that’s been struggling to retain office tenants since even before the pandemic.Xeris signed a 13-year lease for 87,000 square feet at 1375 West Fulton Street. The new lease is an expansion for the company, which previously leased 40,000 square feet at 180 North LaSalle Street and 11,000 square feet in the Fulton Street building.With the deal, Xeris becomes the anchor tenant of the 14-story Trammel Crow-developed building that includes lab space for multiple life sciences companies, including Vanqua Bio, Talis Biomedical and Charles River Laboratories.Xeris CEO Paul Edick said the company was eager to consolidate its footprint into one of the buildings it already occupied. Kyle Kamin of CBRE, negotiated the new lease on behalf of Xeris, while Kelsey Scheive, also of CBRE, represented the landlord.The expanded lease is positive news for Chicago, which historically has lost growing pharmaceutical companies like Xeris to other more mature life sciences markets such as Boston or San Francisco. Developers have worked to address the main problem, which is a lack of high-quality and well-located lab space, by including that kind of space in more properties near the heart of the city.The firm will list the 40,000 square feet it occupied at 190 North LaSalle on the sublease market, adding to a record amount of downtown secondary space already available.Trammell Crow built the 14-floor, 301,000-square-foot 1375 West Fulton as the first phase of its Fulton Labs project, and earlier this year completed the second at 400 North Aberdeen Street, a 16-story, 420,000-square-foot project.Before Google finalized its purchase of the Thompson Center in the Loop, the tech company was reportedly considering expanding its Fulton Market presence by up to 200,000 square feet at the Aberdeen building but later dropped that option. readmore title=”Read more”][/readmore]— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",375 West Fulton Street,Trammell Crow’s, Fulton Labs delivered a boost to Chicago’s push to give life sciences lab tenants local options by landing Xeris Biopharma Holdings to an expansion.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/10/04/trammell-crow-nabs-xeris-in-fulton-market-with-lasalle-exit/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Trammell Crow’s</a> Fulton Labs delivered a boost to Chicago’s push to give life sciences lab tenants local options by landing Xeris Biopharma Holdings to an expansion.","375 West Fulton Street Chicago, IL","375 W Fulton St, Chicago, IL 60661, USA","(41.8868997, -87.64000810000002, 0.0)",41.8868997,-87.64000810000002,0.0,2022

02:44 PM","Self-storage, once regarded as a niche investment, is looking better than ever.","[""Recession-proof self-storage market heads into second boom (iStock)Self-storage, once regarded as a niche investment, is looking better than ever.Occupancy rates at self-storage facilities nationwide jumped to 94.5 percent in 2021 from 91 percent from pre-pandemic 2019. Average monthly costs for a 10′ by 10′ climate-controlled storage unit rose 10.5 percent to $146.72 in the second quarter of 2021 from the same period two years earlier, according to the 2022 Self-Storage Almanac.For self-storage companies across America, the pandemic meant a surge in business as spare rooms and garages were turned into home offices. Now there’s a second boom as people work from home, or plan to return to offices, or a combination of the two, making self-storage a durable business. While offices plan to bring back employees, the need for self-storage will be driven by people migrating into cities from rural or suburban areas, prompting the need to downsize. The rise in home prices, more likely to result in people moving to smaller spaces, may add to reasons why they want to sign up for self-storage use.“When people think of commercial real estate, they think of apartments and office buildings, but storage has proven to be a great business and has garnered incremental capital to invest in the asset class,” said Juan Sanabria, managing director of BMO Capital Markets.Since the start of the pandemic, the five U.S. publicly traded self-storage real estate investment trusts – Public Storage, Cube Smart, Extra Space Storage, Life Storage, and National Storage Affiliates Trust – gained an average of 142.8 percent. They outperformed the S&P 500’s return of 93.7 percent over the two years from March 16, 2020, the day after the country started shutting down businesses and schools.The best performer was Life Storage, which jumped almost three-fold to about $134 from $49 during that period. Even the worst performer, Public Storage, which accounts for about half the $125 billion market capitalization of the five REITs, gained about 109 percent.Self-storage firms are capitalizing on the rising tide. CubeSmart closed on a $1.7 billion acquisition of Storage West in December. The public company owned at least 1,200 properties as of late 2020 and has only expanded since then. In November, Public Storage bought the 56 self-storage facilities from All Storage for $1.5 billion, expanding its portfolio by about 36 million net rentable square feet since 2019.The self-storage market is one of the rare industries that perform well both during good and bad times, driven by the four traditional D’s – death, divorce, downsizing, and dislocation. “Self storage executives see robust demand not only from traditional drivers but from two additional Ds: decluttering and distribution/business demand,” according to Yardi Matrix, a platform providing commercial real estate market data.Operators are also looking to new uses for self-storage properties, including for distribution and logistics facilities. Properties near population centers “are perfectly located for last-mile delivery,” Joseph Saffire, chief executive of Life Storage, told Yardi Matrix.The asset class also benefits from customers’ tendency to be “sticky,” an industry term for long-term users who are reluctant to switch units even when rents increase. For users, self-storage monthly payments are a small expense compared with mortgages, car payments, and school tuition, while the value of their belongings is high, said Sean Delaney, Marcus & Millichap’s senior vice president investments.“If they’re renting a storage unit and they’ve got all their belongings, they’re not going to not pay the bill that’s arguably one of the lower expenses of the monthly budget,” said Delaney.Pulling out from storage can also translate into higher rents because the owners can charge prices according to the current market rather than locked into a lower rate.Developers seeking to build new self-storage facilities face high barriers to entry. Municipalities can limit where structures go, zoning approvals can take months, escalating construction costs, and supply chain difficulties combined mean it may take as much as five years before a new facility is fully leased.That’s been good for the Storage Acquisition Group, which buys and sells existing self-storage facilities. The company eclipsed $350 million in deals last year, an increase of 25 percent from the pandemic.“In urban areas like Chicago, where you can pay a lot less per square foot, it makes sense to just have your necessities in your living area and then have a storage facility that’s down the street.” said Monty Spencer, president of the Storage Acquisition Group.Even with those barriers to entry, overbuilding remains the biggest threat to the sector’s continued success. It’s happened before.The excess supply growth of self-storage starting in 2016 pushed up vacancy rates through 2019 with the Southwest part of the country reaching almost 15 percent and the South Atlantic states about 14 percent.“I think we have peaked in terms of the bumps we got from COVID,” Stephen Clark II of the Clark Investment Group, a real estate developer specializing in self-storage, told the Chicago Tribune. A lot of that will stick because people like having the space. But if this prompts overbuilding, it could be ruinous.”Continued growth in self-storage also hinges in part on Americans’ reluctance to let go of their stuff. And for those people who fail to pay their rent, their long-hoarded belongings could end up with a starring role on the 14-season reality show Storage Wars, in which bidders make offers on locked storage units sight unseen.“As the industry evolves, the demand drivers keep changing and more storage gets built,” said Marcus & Millichap’s Delaney. “It’s hard to say what all the demand drivers are. The one thing for sure is that it’s a culture. We’re consumers by nature and most people don’t like to throw things out.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",91 percent from pre-pandemic 2019.

08:00 AM",Just how much has Chicago’s construction market slumped? The city’s top five contractors fell short of $1 billion of work last year – the same amount that just two accomplished during a year-long period ending in 2018.,"[""Lendlease’s Ted Weldon and Kinjal Patel; 455 East WatersideJust how much has Chicago’s construction market slumped? The city’s top five contractors fell short of $1 billion of work last year – the same amount that just two accomplished during a year-long period ending in 2018.Leading the 2021 rankings was Lendlease, even as it underperformed its historical local average, according to an analysis by The Real Deal of reported costs on building permits for projects started between Jan. 1 and Dec. 7 last year. The rest of the top five, in order, consists of Power Construction, Executive Construction, Turner Construction and Related’s in-house construction manager LR Contracting.The down year hasn’t crushed the optimism of Ted Weldon, who runs Lendlease’s development branch in Chicago. He’s still bullish on his home town, brushing aside concern about Illinois’ population loss and pointing instead to downtown residential growth that’s topping any other U.S. city.“People are flowing out of Illinois, but into the central business district,” Weldon said in an interview. “We expect the next five years of continued growth, and of the tech sector especially into Chicago, bringing more jobs in. We see that as an opportunity for more multifamily.”Expectations for a recovery are tempered, though signs have emerged it has already begun. Residential projects will keep expanding their market share, as will infrastructure work, while the commercial market share is on pace to slip in 2022 by a little less than 1 percent after dropping 7.8 percent last year, according to research firm Cummings. The overall market is forecast to grow 3 percent this year.”The market is going to rebound,” said Michael Cwienkala, president of the Chicagoland Associated General Contractors trade group. “Maybe not to pre-pandemic levels, but hopefully near pre-pandemic levels. We continue to be pretty conservative with our market projection.”Last year’s slow market masked some surprises. While commercial projects’ market share sank by almost 8 percent overall, the sagging market for new office buildings thrust multifamily, usually a small proportion, to the forefront as its share rose by about the same percentage.Multifamily accounted for the two most expensive building permits issued in the period: the $150 million, 503-unit Cascade apartments across 37 stories at 455 Waterside Drive in Lakeshore East, and the $130 million, 440-unit mixed-use apartment and condo structure Reed at Southbank at 234 West Polk Street along the Chicago River in the South Loop. Lendlease developed both, with Magellan serving as a partner on the Cascade, and oversaw construction on each as general contractor.Life sciences projects also made up a bigger portion of the total than usual as some developers turned to lab-like facilities, which are difficult or impossible to replicate at home, from traditional office developments. The first such project in Sterling Bay’s Lincoln Yards pulled a $64.7 million permit for Power Construction to build the Ally lab building at 1229 West Concord Place.“There’s a lot of activity in the life science market,” said Kate VanZeyl at New York-based Turner, ranked No. 4.Although that permit ranked eighth-priciest in the year, it was the biggest new construction start for anything remotely considered a conventional commercial workplace. That’s a big change from 2020, when the city’s top two construction permits were for the $476 million BMO Harris Bank tower near Union Station and the $360 million Wolf Point South tower.Contractors needed just eight construction cranes in October, down from 18 in March 2020 and well below 62 in 2017, said McHugh Construction President Mike Meagher, whose company finished No. 9 in the contractor ranking for the year at $99 million. The firm, founded in 1897and propelled to prominence for its high-rise work on the Marina City towers in the 1960s, ranked ninth in 2021, coming in just shy of $99 million with its reported costs on permits.“For most, 2021 was a very challenging year,” Meagher said. “There was hesitation and uncertainty that played a major factor during 2021 for developers, and investors as well, deciding to put dollars into Chicago or not.”The market picked up in last year’s second half, Meagher said. His firm resumed work late in the year on the 805-foot, 73-story 1000M apartment building on Michigan Avenue, after pausing early in the pandemic. Developers Time Equities and JK Equities changed plans, switching to build more than 700 apartments instead of the more than 500 condos originally pitched for the site.Two other developers’ in-house construction teams – Related’s LR Contracting and Onni Development’s builder – also finished in The Real Deal’s ranking. Related’s in-house builder, LR, finished fifth with $123 million. The bulk of its work was on the city’s third-largest contract last year, the 43-story, 300-unit apartment building at 900 West Randolph Street in Fulton Market. Bowa Construction co-managed the project, becoming the first minority-owned construction firm to build a Chicago highrise.“We have great subcontractors here, we have great general contractors here,” said LR’s Don Biernacki. “It’s exciting to be working on a project like 900. It’s exciting to be in Fulton Market.”Onni Group’s construction firm ranked No. 7 at $103 million, almost all of it for the 32-story, 373-unit Fulton River District residential building at 354 North Union Avenue, the city’s fourth biggest contract in 2021.Normally, in-house contracting work makes up 30 percent of Lendlease’s business while the rest are jobs awarded by third-party developers, Weldon said. That mix shifted in 2021 as more than $280 million in reported costs on permits stemmed from the two residential towers, Cascade and the Reed, among a total of $302 million-worth of work performed by Lendlease across all its permits.Lendlease’s construction arm was still busy working for developers other than those it employs, too. It drew a $3.5 million permit when it was hired by MCZ Development for the first phase of the 21-story, 224-apartment project at 166 North Aberdeen Street, an area where more than 9,000 housing units are in various stages of planning. Lendlease so far has put $5.2 million into that property, and the company landed another residential permit to start the first $3.5 million of work from developer CMK Development for a 30-story, 299-unit building at 1400 South Wabash Avenue that will likely end up costing $100 million. Both are slated to open in 2023.“The 2021 construction value is markedly lower than Lendlease’s historical averages,” said Kinjal Patel, the company’s general manager of construction in Chicago. “However, we see the future pipeline as optimistic to regain operating rhythm.”Local players dominated the rest of the field, taking seven of the top 10 spots. While eighth-place Onni is headquartered in Vancouver, and New York-based Turner landed in the top five at $127 million, carried in part by more than $20 million of work for the Obama Presidential Center, and Indiana’s Hunt Construction was eighth at $99 million, Chicago-based firms took the remainder of the top spots.Power Construction’s $214 million of work led the way among locals. It landed 62 permits, more than all but one other firm in the top 10, Skender Construction, which ranked 10th at $94 million with 63. Power, The Real Deal’s top contractor in Chicago in 2019 by square footage, declined to comment.Power’s largest contract in 2021 was for $65 million of work on a life science lab at 1229 West Concord Place, the first building in the $6 billion Lincoln Yards megadevelopment by Sterling Bay on the North Side.“Power is a known commodity in Chicago, just like McHugh, just like Lendlease,” said Troy Imke of Mark Goodman and Associates, a developer planning a life sciences lab at 400 North Elizabeth Street just northwest of Google’s offices in Fulton Market.Power’s long relationship with Northwestern Medicine has helped get it work on life science projects for the health care system and others, and Chicago wants to lure more development of its lab sector, which could help lift contractors out of last year’s slump.Power also pulled permits for $11 million of work for the Fulton Labs property at 1375 West Fulton Street, construction of which cost $16 million with Skender chipping in more than $5 million. That property was an example of how a developer, Trammell Crow, incorporated a lab into its traditional office design before building began.Even as downtown Chicago offices outside Fulton Market emptied during the pandemic, contractors found big jobs for office renovations last year. More than $2.3 billion went into all types of renovations and alterations last year on more than 6,000 permits, compared with $1.8 billion total of new construction on less than 1,000 permits.Chicago’s market for office renovations is growing. It’s split between landlords sprucing up older structures with amenities to compete with the newest buildings in the hot Fulton Market district featuring lounges, bars and rooftop decks for workers; and renovations of the huge amount of tenant spaces vacated or put onto the sublease market by tenants.\nGardner Construction, which finished No. 14 in the market by dollar volume, won Chicago’s biggest office renovation project for just under $62 million of work on the eight-story building at 801 South Canal Street. Executive Construction, Chicago’s No. 3 contractor for 2021, landed the second largest office renovation for $55 million on a first-time tenant buildout at 433 West Van Buren Street. Turner handled the third most costly office renovation for almost $50 million across three floors at 131 South Dearborn Street.“The other piece of our business that has experienced a tremendous amount of growth is our special projects division,” said Turner’s VanZeyl. “That’s a group of individuals in our business unit focused on fast-paced projects. They respond quickly to clients’ needs, with a significant amount of work in the interiors market.”Office renovations are Executive’s specialty, along with work on projects like data centers and new office construction, and it doesn’t work on residential projects.“We came into 2021 with a very low backlog,” said Executive’s Dave Hetrick. “Work that had been lined up was canceled or postponed. We have seen a strong rebound in the tenant interior market in Chicago, though, in the past nine to 12 months, and the forecast for the next six to 12 months looks strong in that market.”The fate of Loop depends on investment into more renovations.Old buildings losing out on new business tenants to the latest wave of development probably need renovations and fancier amenities, or conversions into housing for students, seniors and downtown workers. AmTrust Realty has agreed to spend $100 million to improve its Loop portfolio, a move that already yielded a lease from a law firm in one of the properties.“I do think the tide is turning,” Meagher said. “This year looks exponentially better than 2021. Last year you saw a lot of institutional money that was speculative about the city of Chicago. This year you see them buying into the vision for the city.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",37 stories at 455 Waterside Drive,Just how much has, Chicago’s construction market slumped?

Until recently, the property held a Target, which shuttered last year amid protests by local activists.In a statement, the president of Blue Cross of Illinois parent Health Care Service Corp. said the project seeks to improve the community and address “societal factors, such as joblessness.”Health Care Services also expanded earlier this year to the supertall Aon Center.“This facility represents the type of collaboration, partnership and investment we need to improve the lives of residents while also boosting the economic development of our communities,” said Mayor Lori Lightfoot in a statement. Lightfoot sharply criticized real estate developers in her May inaugural address.DL3 and Blue Cross did not receive state or city incentives on the project, Crain’s reported.The Morgan Park Center is expected to open in the second quarter of 2020 and bring 550 jobs to the area. The price tag for the deal was undisclosed, but appears to be the first big move since HCSC CEO Paula Steiner and CFO Eric Feldstein departed last month.DL3, led by Leon Walker, recently helped build a new Jewel-Osco grocery store and plans to demolish and redevelop the Washington Park Bank building in Woodlawn. Walker told The Real Deal earlier this year that he also plans to buy and reposition another closed South Side Target store in Chatham.DL3 also recently joined rapper Common to propose a 128-acre film production campus and is planning several other redevelopment projects in the South Side with developer Sterling Bay.

08:00 AM","One of Chicago’s biggest office tenants looks ready to exit much of its space in a West Loop building next year after listing about 130,000 square feet for sublease.","[""From left: MetLife Investment Management’s Steven J. Goulart and CME Group’s Terrence A. Duffy along with 550 West Washington Boulevard (MetLife, CME Group, Google Maps)One of Chicago’s biggest office tenants looks ready to exit much of its space in a West Loop building next year after listing about 130,000 square feet for sublease.CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, has been marketing most of its space at 550 West Washington Boulevard at $32.50 per square foot, according to a Colliers listing. The lease term expires next year and a direct lease extension is available.The listing is among record office supply in downtown Chicago’s secondary market, where 6.2 million square feet was available for sublease in the second quarter, the brokerage MBRE found. Companies with leases expiring soon have turned to subleases as a preference for remote work endures even with the virus receding.Offering a sublease gives tenants a chance to cut their real estate costs as they prepare to rethink office needs, increasingly resulting in companies deciding to shrink their workplaces and make attending in person optional for at least a day or two per week.CME’s cutback at Washington isn’t the company’s first recent move to unload real estate. In November, it sold a 300,000-square-foot building at 333 South LaSalle Street for $39.5 million to electric utility ComEd, which is turning what used to be the Chicago Board of Trade’s largest trading floor into a power substation.The ComEd deal was a sale-leaseback: CME occupied the building this year ahead of moving into 145,000 square feet nearby at 141 West Jackson Boulevard, a two-building complex CME also formerly owned that it sold to a venture of GlenStar Properties and USAA Real Estate for $152 million in 2012. The Jackson property now hosts the exchange manager’s trading floor, as well as the Cboe’s.With the reduction from its 245,000 square feet leased in 2006 at the 16-story, 372,000-square-foot Washington building, CME is unraveling a 2006 shift of much of its Chicago workforce from its longtime headquarters at 20 South Wacker Drive.The Washington building was bought by MetLife Investment Management for $112 million in 2012. The CME lease there expanded the exchange’s Chicago offices from its Wacker location, a Tishman Speyer-owned complex called the CME Center. The property’s namesake tenant has increased its lease there to 575,000 square feet on a deal expiring in 2032 through several expansions since January 2018, when the company started adding to the 490,000 square feet it had at the time, SEC filings show.The company decided several years ago to relocate most of its Chicago-based employees to its headquarters, and has trimmed its use of the Washington building as its Wacker space has been expanded and renovated in stages, a CME spokesperson said in an email.If much of CME’s space in the MetLife building goes unclaimed on the secondary market ahead of its lease expiration next year, the landlord will be dealing with a building almost half vacant. It’s already facing a 13 percent direct vacancy rate, a figure that doesn’t reflect CME’s unused space on the secondary market, brokerage MBRE reported. CME’s sublease is the largest among Chicago’s 30 newest buildings of 300,000 square feet or more.A MetLife spokesperson declined to comment on the cutback, and Tishman didn’t return requests for comment.

Randolph (top) and Marquette Companies’ planned apartment building at 1440 W. Randolph St. in the Fulton Market DistrictDespite receiving approval from the city’s Plan Commission on Thursday, the developers of two Fulton Market projects still have a lot to figure out.On Thursday, the city’s Plan Commission approved the construction of a 16-story Standard Hotel and an additional 11-story apartment building, both located on W. Randolph St. But many have voiced their concerns over the construction due to the increase in traffic and proximity to Union Park.The 259-room hotel, a venture by New York-based DDG and Chicago-based Marc Realty, will be located at 1234 W. Randolph St. in the West Loop/Fulton Market area. The hotel will not provide any parking options and will rely solely on valet services, causing a huge increase in traffic in the already congested area. A neighbor complained at last month’s meeting, according to Block Club.A supervising zoning plan examiner on the project, Noah Szafraniec, said he wouldn’t sign off on the project until he saw a detailed valet plan.An earlier plan called for a 23-story hotel at the site, a converted industrial dairy facility. It’s been revised, and construction could start in the spring if the city council approves it.As The Real Deal previously reported, there’s a glut of hotel development planned for the Fulton Market District, and it’s unlikely that demand will be as high as the supply.Additionally, a 243-unit apartment building, developed by Marquette Companies has also been approved by the Plan Commission. The developer plans to renovate and extend an existing five story office space located at 1440 W. Randolph St. This project will help to fulfill obligations under the city’s Affordable Requirements Ordinance passed earlier this year providing nearly 50 affordable units both on and off-site.Ald. Walter Burnett Jr. (27th) has vocally opposed the project.“I have a problem with this one because it’s across from the park,” he said during a meeting. “People that go into the building are going to be complaining to me.

The buyer of both properties was a joint venture of Westport Properties U.S. Storage Centers, which are both based in Irvine, California.“We buy non-institutional property, work with it, turn it around and make it pretty and sell to the institutional guys,” Turik said. “The last three years, especially during the pandemic, the demand skyrocketed.”The Old Town self-storage facility at 1516 North Orleans Street in Chicago was the pricier of the two sold, for about $20 million, according to Turik. The Wilmette property at 3150 Wilmette Avenue sold for about $12 million. The buyers didn’t return a request for comment.While the health crisis and its impacts boosted the “four D’s” that drive the self-storage market — death, divorce, displacement and downsizing — it’s now inflation that’s extending the runway for its growth in demand. The more flexible lease terms typical of the self-storage business, that allow for monthly adjustments to rental rates, make the properties a strong hedge against inflation.“As opposed to industrial, we’re not in multi-year leases for rents with one or two tenants. We have hundreds or sometimes thousands of tenants, as month-to-month renters,” Turik said.When he got started in the self-storage market about 15 years ago, Turik was buying such real estate at a 9 percent cap rate, a measure of a property’s rental income after expenses divided its purchase price. Since then, they’ve compressed to about 4 percent, a reflection of the sector’s rising values and decreasing risk as demand swelled.“In two or three years, we’ve experienced demand that normally takes five or 10,” Turik said.The Chicago area also ranks among the top ten markets for its pipeline of new planned storage developments. It’s set to receive 2.6 million square feet in the coming years, according to a report from earlier this year. The area has the largest share of storage space planned in urban markets among the sector’s top cities, with 91 percent of the developing space eschewing the suburbs.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1516 North Orleans Street,Brothers Alex and, Nik Turik started their Chicago real estate investment firm HAN Capital to enter the self-storage property market in 2009 when it was a niche segment of the industry.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/09/23/turiks-han-capital-pulls-in-32m-on-chicago-self-storage-boom/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Brothers Alex and</a> Nik Turik started their Chicago real estate investment firm HAN Capital to enter the self-storage property market in 2009 when it was a niche segment of the industry.","1516 North Orleans Street Chicago, IL","1516 N Orleans St, Chicago, IL 60610, USA","(41.9099343, -87.63784009999999, 0.0)",41.9099343,-87.63784009999999,0.0,2022

It will include more than 12,000 square feet of retail space and 255 parking spaces, according to Curbed.Orlando-based ZOM said the project will consist of two 15-story towers atop a three-story podium. The units will range from studios to three-bedrooms and cover between 501 and 1,377 square feet, with an average of 737 square feet, the developer said.When the project was introduced in 2016, it had 405 apartments in three towers, ranging from eight to 17 stories, but the developers scaled it back in the face of community opposition.The complex, designed by Chicago-based bKL architects, is two blocks from the Morgan stop on the CTA’s Green Line. Pre-leasing in Union West is expected to start in the second quarter of 2019, with delivery of the first units expected by the end of next year. The project is being funded with a $92 million construction loan from Union Labor Life Insurance Company.It is among a number of high-rises proposed in the booming Fulton Market district in the West Loop. Tucker Development and Related Midwest are now proposing a 495-foot tower at 900 West Randolph Street.While the John Buck Company has plans for two 17-story towers on the site of the old H20 Plus facility at 845 West Madison Street. Fifield Companies and F&F Realty are building the 44-story One South Halsted project along the Kennedy Expressway.\xa0[Curbed] — John O’BrienAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",933 West Washington Boulevard,The city has granted," a demolition permit for the planned Union West apartment complex in the West Loop, clearing the way for construction to start on the large project.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/03/28/zom-living-to-start-work-on-357-unit-union-west-complex/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The city has granted</a> a demolition permit for the planned Union West apartment complex in the West Loop, clearing the way for construction to start on the large project.","933 West Washington Boulevard Chicago, IL","933 W Washington Blvd, Chicago, IL 60606, USA","(41.8829657, -87.6510619, 0.0)",41.8829657,-87.6510619,0.0,2018

West Side Ald. Jason Ervin, the chairman of the council’s Black Caucus, said some of the stores will need a complete rebranding, while others can keep the Save A Lot name.Michael Nance, a partner in Yellow Banana’s holding company, said he and his partners met with Save A Lot executives who understand that a total rebranding of some of the stores is necessary. Yellow Banana will be required to buy about 60 percent of their wholesale products from Save A Lot, but will have the flexibility to operate under a new store name.The $13.5 million will come from TIF funding and other city subsidies. The six stores included in the redevelopment agreement are located in the West and South Sides.Nance said the company is considering multiple ways to rebrand and reconnect with the city. Yellow Banana may choose to hire a local artist to create a mural on the side of one or more of the buildings that shows the communities’ culture.In accordance with the agreement, the stores, which have significant maintenance issues, must remain open for at least the next 10 years.“If a single store closes or is sold during that time, then the developer must return all previously dispersed funds to the city for all six stores,” Deputy Planning and Development Commissioner Tim Jeffries told the outlet.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",420 South Pulaski Road,Chicago is providing, $13.5 million for a Black-owned business to revitalize its grocery stores across the city.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/11/15/city-grants-13-5m-for-save-a-lot-redevelopments/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Chicago is providing</a> $13.5 million for a Black-owned business to revitalize its grocery stores across the city.","420 South Pulaski Road Chicago, IL","420 S Pulaski Rd, Chicago, IL 60624, USA","(41.8746048, -87.7262597, 0.0)",41.8746048,-87.7262597,0.0,2022

The reality is a bit more complicated: Trump Tower is an anomaly.","[""From left (highlighted buildings): St. Regis Chicago, One Bennett Park, Chicago’s Trump International Hotel & Tower (Alvesgaspar, CC BY-SA 4.0 – via Wikimedia Commons, St. Regis Chicago, LoopNet, iStock/Photo Illustration by Steven Dilakian for The Real Deal)Some brokers are crowing about how the $20 million sale of a penthouse at Trump Tower in Chicago is a sign that buyers don’t care about rising rates, falling stocks, or the prospect of a widening war. The reality is a bit more complicated: Trump Tower is an anomaly.The 14,260-square-foot full-floor, five-bedroom 89th-floor condo sold March 7, about six months after Sanjay Shay, CEO of Hoffman Estates-based software maker Vistex, listed the unit for $30 million. Still, the $20 million sale was the second-priciest ever in Chicago, after the 2017 purchase by Citadel Chief Executive Officer Ken Griffin of four condos for more than $58 million in the building at 9 West Walton Street on the Gold Coast in 2017.The deal was taken as a sign by some that the city’s 2021 luxury condo boom – driven by a stock rally and the desire for more space in the work-from-home pandemic era – would continue and even accelerate. Then came inflation concerns, the prospect of higher rates, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and sanctions, and a much more volatile stock market.“I did get some buyers saying a decent amount of money they had went down because of what happened in the stock market,” said Giancarlo Chavez, an agent for Keller Williams ONE Chicago, who closed an $8.42 million deal for a four-bedroom 75th-floor condo at the St. Regis Chicago last year. “If the stocks keep going down, they [buyers] may look at their equity and reconsider their purchase.”Five condos in the city of Chicago priced at $4 million and more changed hands as of March 9, compared with just two during the same period last year, according to the Multiple Listing Service. In all of 2021, 42 condos sold for more than $4 million, with an $11.25 million sale of an 8,800-square-foot 26th-floor penthouse unit at 840 North Lake Shore Drive setting the highest-priced condo sale last year.“I think we’ll see also a lot of turnarounds in new buildings,’’ said Coldwell Banker’s Chezi Rafaeli, the broker on the Trump Tower penthouse, who sold 10 units priced between $4 million and $20 million in 2021. “People are trying to update to newer, larger units, newer buildings.”For now, potential buyers are watching the economic fallout from the war. On March 7, the S&P 500 fell about 3 percent, its most dramatic daily decline since October 2020 as investors feared higher energy prices would slow the economy and spark higher inflation, leading the Federal Reserve to raise benchmark interest rates.All of those factors apply to Trump Tower, with one addition: The name.Built in 2009, the property includes retail, parking, a 339-room hotel, and condos. The building has a 20.6-foot tall “TRUMP” sign overlooking the Chicago River.The Trump brand, once considered by some a marker of high-end products and real estate, has been irrevocably tied with his divisive presidency. That brand is further complicated in Chicago, an overwhelmingly Democratic city that Trump regularly denounced as president.“Obviously the building was impacted by the presidency,” said Gail Lissner, managing director at Integra Realty Resources. “It became a little bit more of a building where people definitely liked it or had some issue with the name. It probably had a smaller pool of potential buyers due to the controversy around him.”Lissner said the property has tremendous upsides in its location, design, and views. The property was mirroring the market as it rose, then over the last five years, there was a weakening in prices at Trump Tower that was more significant than the rest of the market.Lissner compiled the average sales price of condos within Chicago’s Trump Tower from MRED, the Chicago area’s multiple listing service. In the first and second quarters of 2021, the average sale price per square foot was $579. That jumped to $662 in the third and fourth quarters.“It was more heavily impacted than other buildings, but condo prices, in general, have not been real robust in the Chicago Downtown market.”The buyer of the $20 million condo wasn’t disclosed, so it remains unknown whether there was a political motivation to the purchase.After the Trump Tower condo sale, the 7,500-square-foot full-floor penthouse unit on the 65th floor at One Bennett Park in Streeterville is now the highest-priced condo on the market at just over $15 million.A 47-story condo tower, known as Cirrus Condominiums, in Lakeshore East is expected to deliver 350 units with prices ranging from $400,000 to $5 million in the first quarter. Luxury condo developments are set to expand to Fulton Market from the Streeterville and Lakeshore East neighborhoods, where One Bennett Park and St. Regis are located. Dubbed Momad, four units for the 10-story, 25-unit condo at 1010 West Madison Street, already went under contract at just under $6 million in November, even before breaking ground.Contact Connie Kim\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Miranda Davis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",30 million.

12:00 PM",Even lifelong Chicagoans could be forgiven for thinking they’ve crossed into small-town Indiana when they take Ewing Avenue past 100th Street.,"[""Clockwise from top left: Bungalows in East Side, a “pocket park” fountain in East Side, a vacant storefront in Hegewisch, Hegewisch Marsh ParkEven lifelong Chicagoans could be forgiven for thinking they’ve crossed into small-town Indiana when they take Ewing Avenue past 100th Street.But in some ways, the lunch-bucket communities of East Side and Hegewisch are as Chicago as you can get: small shops and gilded-era workers cottages, built for organized steelworkers and maintained by off-duty cops and firefighters.The area bears an architectural resemblance to other outskirt neighborhoods like Dunning and Mount Greenwood, with corrugated metal houses mixed among brick bungalows and American foursquares.But unlike those neighborhoods, the Southeast Side boasts hundreds of acres of undeveloped land, with plenty of protected natural scenery to boot. East Side abuts the lakefront with the 200-acre Calumet Park, and Hegewisch is surrounded by huge swathes of marshland preserved by city, state and county agencies.The industrial-era enclave has been on a slow decline since the offshoring days of the 1970s and ‘80s, and the enduring vacancy of the nearby 440-acre South Works site remains an ominous sign for investors. But now that warehouse developers in the region can’t seem to staunch their hunger for more space, the Southeast Side could be in perfect position for a rebound.In the beginningIn 1883, steel magnate Adolph Hegewisch picked a remote stretch on the east bank of the Calumet River to build a company town, vowing to build a canal that would connect the nearby Wolf Lake to Lake Michigan.The canal never materialized, but Republic Steel and other manufacturers followed Hegewisch and opened factories along the river in the 1900s and 1910s, juicing home construction for the Eastern European immigrant workers who poured their metal. About two miles up the river from Hegewisch, steelworkers formed another bedroom community they called East Side.As the metals industry expanded in the 1920s and ‘30s, the Southeast Side became a hotbed for union organizing, eventually giving rise to the powerful political submachine that produced City Council titan Ed Vrdoylak. Sue Sadlowski-Garza, daughter of United Steelworkers of America leader Ed Sadlowski, was elected alderman of the far-reaching 10th Ward in 2015.The area’s economic fortunes turned with the American steel industry’s decline in the 1970s, and both Hegewisch and East Side began to bleed population. Republic Steel wound down its production through the 1980s, and U.S. Steel shut down South Works in 1992.But the neighborhoods stayed afloat in part thanks to Ford’s 2.8 million-square-foot auto plant, which has been pumping out cars at 126th Street and Torrence Avenue since 1924.Signs of changeIn 2016, city leaders chose Chinese manufacturer CRRC Sifang America to build a 380,000-square-foot CTA train car factory in Hegewisch. The company paid $87 million this spring to buy the 45-acre property at 13535 South Torrence Avenue, just south of the Ford Plant, from Centerpoint Properties.And this summer, the Missouri-based Northpoint Development announced plans to build a nearly 200-acre campus of spec distribution warehouses along the west side of Avenue O, the main connector between East Side and Hegewisch. City leaders agreed to kick $25.3 million from the Lake Calumet tax increment financing district into the $169 million project.TransportationEast Side is bisected by the Chicago Skyway and Hegewisch offers quick access to the Bishop Ford Expressway, both of which can get drivers to the Loop in 25 minutes on a light traffic day.The Metra Electric Line only runs west of the Calumet River, but the Indiana-based South Shore Line branches out from the Metra tracks around 130th Street and stops in Hegewisch on its way to South Bend.Both Hegewisch and East Side are served by the CTA No. 30 bus, which trails down Ewing Avenue and Avenue O. The part-time CTA No. 100 bus shuttles passengers between East Side and the 95th/Dan Ryan Red Line station via 106th Street.Residential Take“It’s a working-class neighborhood, and a lot of city workers live there because they can get a great affordable house with good schools and lakefront access,” said Louis Silva, an @properties broker who sells homes primarily on the Southeast Side. “You can get a rehabbed single-family home for under $200,000, although that number is now starting to push up. The average price for a fixed-up four-bedroom is around $185,000, which is a little over 2006 levels. We’ve traditionally lost out on a lot of retail and commercial because we’re so close to the Indiana border, but with all this new industrial, those employees are going to want to eat and go out. So hopefully some of those neighborhood bars are going to reopen.”Commercial Take“It’s a very industrial-driven part of the city, and when you get that far east it gets a little dead in terms of multifamily” buildings, said Aaron Sklar of commercial brokerage Kiser Group. “But with so many big speculations going on, I think a lot of people are betting on new multifamily and single-family from the jobs that would inevitably come from that. A lot of that doesn’t exist yet, but I expect to see a huge uptick in both residential and commercial prices in the next few years.“The East Side is similar to the rest of the South Side in that investors are looking for cash-on-cash returns, and you have a handful of out-of-town developers coming in because of these [capitalization] rates that are just unheard of in most of the country.”Demographics (ZIP Code 60633)2016 population: 12,817 (down 1 percent since 2010)Median age: 39.1Median family income: $61,250Median non-family income: $29,179Average residential sale price within the last 12 months$125,000 — $104 per square footAverage current residential listing price$141,411 — $122 per square footPriciest residential sale3853 East 110th Street — $335,000Most expensive home on the market11524 South Avenue G — $289,000Least expensive home on the market10326 South Avenue H — $39,900Price trends (Redfin)The median family home price in Hegewisch hit $153,000 in July, a 28 percent spike over July 2018.

That sale was subject to an unspecified contingency and has since fallen through.The home was then re-listed in December for $9.5 million, and came under contract earlier this month. The listing price doesn’t necessarily indicate what the buyers will pay, which won’t be available in public records until the sale closes.Michael LaFido, of eXp Realty, is the agent for the sellers. He wouldn’t comment on the sale price or the deal beyond confirming the house has a new buyer.Sellers Sam and Geralyn Cecola, owners of the Admiral Theater strip club on Chicago’s North Side, built the home in 2008 and initially listed it for $15.9 million in 2013. Successive price cuts had shaved the asking price down to $9.5 million by 2019 and $7.5 million in May 2020.Starting in 2014, the estate was featured as the home of lead actor Terrance Howard’s character Lucious Lyon on “Empire,” which concluded with its sixth season in 2020. Located between Keene and Heather Lakes, the home has six bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, a large outdoor pool, boat slip and garage parking for nine cars, according to the listing.The home is an anomaly in the Barrington Hills market, which is about 40 miles northwest of Chicago. Should the deal close, it would be the only sale of more than $5 million in the suburb in recent years. The suburban luxury market continues to outperform over sectors in Chicago. Mansions in Kenilworth and Winnetka are at the top of the market, seeking $14 million and $16 million, respectively.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",45 Lakeview Lane,The mansion in," Chicago suburb Barrington Hills that was featured in the FoxTV series “Empire,” has another buyer after an earlier attempt to sell the house fell through.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/04/28/empire-mansion-finally-has-a-buyer-after-nine-years-on-the-market/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The mansion in</a> Chicago suburb Barrington Hills that was featured in the FoxTV series “Empire,” has another buyer after an earlier attempt to sell the house fell through.","45 Lakeview Lane Chicago, IL","45 Lakeview Ln, Barrington, IL 60010, USA","(42.1311126, -88.14595090000002, 0.0)",42.1311126,-88.14595090000002,0.0,2022

It was built in 1962 and was 10 stories; two floors were added in 1991.The 13th-floor addition will include a 25-seat rotunda board room with views of the skyline, One Development president John Gagliardo told Crain’s. New offices will provide more work space for tenants in the future and allow current tenants to have temporary offices while One Development renovates floor by floor from the top of the building down.Work on the new top floor is expected to start in the fall and be completed in a year, with floor-by-floor renovations to follow.The NAR headquarters sits on a stretch of Michigan Avenue set to see a flurry of activity in the coming years as Golub & Company and CIM Group plan a massive overhaul of the former Tribune Tower complex, which would include construction of Chicago’s second-tallest building.Next door, billionaire Joe Mansueto recently closed on a $255 million deal to buy the iconic Wrigley Bulding.In May, the association raised annual dues 25 percent, from $120 to $150, to go with the extra annual fee of $35 for NAR’s advertising campaign.NAR hadn’t raised dues since 2012, when members were asked to pay an additional $40. Some $17 of the increase was to be dedicated to upping the group’s political activity spending and the remaining $13 was to help pay for a transaction management platform, zipLogix.

He was represented by Rachel Vecchio of Dream Town Realty.Larrea, who has an estimated net worth of $21.2 billion according to Forbes, paid $3.57 million through a limited liability company to buy a 38th-floor condo in the Ritz-Carlton Residences building in 2014. Two years later, Larrea paid $11.7 million through a different limited liability company to buy the full-floor condo on the 52nd floor of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel’s residential portion. Larrea used this same limited liability company to buy the St. Regis unit.Last week, the buyers of a condo in Trump Tower were identified. Private equity veteran Bryan Cressey and his wife, plastic surgeon Iliana Sweis, spent $20 million on the 14,260-square-foot unit sold at 401 North Wabash Avenue.The $20.56 million purchase, which was $2 million over the $18.5 million asking price, was beat out by two package deals. Billionaire Ken Griffin, who recently left Chicago for Miami, spent $58.75 million for four condo units at 9 West Walton Street in four separate transactions in 2017.

The report noted that BentallGreenOak has poured $35 million into improvements at the nearly 50-year-old complex.The decision to sell comes at a time when the Chicago apartment market has taken a big hit, in contrast to the suburbs, where demand remained strong. The third-quarter occupancy rate for Downtown rentals dipped to 87.1 percent from 93.8 percent in the third quarter of 2019. The latest number was the lowest figure in two decades, and has forced landlords to cut rents more than 20 percent year-over-year and offer more concessions.Because MEPT owns the complex but not the dirt underneath, BentallGreenOak negotiated a longer ground lease on McClurg Court in 2019 — to 99 years from 45 years — after the complex failed to sell.

The properties are part of Combs’ $185 million purchase of nine retail stores and three production properties from the Cresco-Columbia Care marijuana business merger.Combs will run the largest Black-owned cannabis company in the country when and if regulators approve the purchase.“My mission has always been to create opportunities for Black entrepreneurs in industries where we’ve traditionally been denied access, and this acquisition provides the immediate scale and impact needed to create a more equitable future in cannabis,” Combs said in a news release.A prominent rapper and record producer, Combs is set to pay $110 million in cash and $45 million in financing through seller notes. His purchase is on track to be approved around the same time as the merger, which is expected to be decided by the first quarter of 2023.Cresco owns 10 retail dispensaries in Illinois, which is the maximum allowed by state law. Because of this, Columbia Care’s dispensaries, which were recently rebranded “Cannabist,” had to be sold off as a divestment, giving a path to Combs to step in.Since recreational cannabis use was legalized in Illinois in January 2020, landlords of dispensaries have been earning more green. In July, local investor Centrum completed a deal that more than tripled the value of a River North building at 60 West Superior Street occupied by a dispensary branded by Verilife.Cannabis researcher Headset said U.S. cannabis sales are expected to pass $30 billion this year and reach $45.8 billion by 2025. Illinois’ 110 dispensaries sold almost $1.78 billion worth of cannabis products. Headset found that Illinois is on track to have $2.55 billion in annual cannabis sales by 2025.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",60 West Superior Street,A famous rapper has, bought cannabis properties in the Chicago area in a deal that could help a massive merger within the budding industry pass muster with regulators.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/11/07/chicago-area-dispensaries-part-of-diddys-185m-cannabis-purchase/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A famous rapper has</a> bought cannabis properties in the Chicago area in a deal that could help a massive merger within the budding industry pass muster with regulators.","60 West Superior Street Chicago, IL","60 W Superior St, Chicago, IL 60654, USA","(41.8959417, -87.6304765, 0.0)",41.8959417,-87.6304765,0.0,2022

A local outlet, the Daily Herald, reported that United will use space at the former Motorola campus at 1501 West Shure Drive. About 900 employees including managers and technical support staff are expected to move from Willis, formerly known as the Sears Tower.The shift doesn’t mean United is abandoning Chicago. About 2,500 headquarters staff will stay at Willis Tower, where the airline is investing millions to renovate amenities.“In terms of whether United is considering moving its headquarters out of downtown, the answer is no,” spokesman Charles Hobart told the outlets. “We remain committed to the city of Chicago.”As remote work upends the traditional office model, landlords are fretting about rising vacancy rates in central business districts. About 22.4 percent of Chicago office space was available in the third quarter, compared with 18.6 percent at the same time last year.The biggest downtown office default came at the 915,000-square-foot Civic Opera House at 20 North Wacker Drive, where New York investment firm 601W was hit with a $195 million foreclosure suit after failing to make monthly loan payments since May.Boeing’s nearby headquarters at 100 North Riverside Plaza are virtually empty as many executives and employees work from home.Moving operations closer to United’s main hub at the O’Hare International Airport “offers crucial advantages, particularly the ability to support the anticipated growth of our airline, given the facility’s larger size and potential for expansion,” said David Kensick, United’s managing director.[Bloomberg]\xa0[Daily Herald] – Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1501 W.

The new headquarters will serve as a model for the firm’s future offices, the firm said.The building is designed as a clubhouse that resembles the nearby boutique hotels rather than the typical corporate environment of the Loop. Cresa plans to spend 50 percent more per square foot for it than it did for its previous offices.“Who wants to go to a sterile central business district?” said Tod Lickerman, CEO of Cresa. “This is an office that will be a magnet which people want to use and where they can work together with their colleagues.”While Cresa plans to expand the number of employees three-fold to about 150 over the next couple of years, its floor plate is one-third the space that it originally thought it needed, taking into account a hybrid work schedule. That’s a choice faced by many downtown firms when leases expire because most employees prefer to work remotely at least some days a week.Fulton Market tenants are paying more to occupy office space at new buildings equipped with lounges, rooftops, gyms, and private meeting rooms.It’s the only part of town where availability dropped last year and demand pushed up the average sale price per square foot to $678 in 2021, compared with the central business district’s $431.Other firms that have leased in Fulton Market include local restaurant operator Gibsons Restaurant Group, which plans to lease 15,000 square feet at a yet-to-be constructed property at 917 West Fulton, developed by developer Fulton Street Companies. Proptech firm VTS signed a deal to lease 36,000 square feet at 320 North Sangamon Street, relocating from the 2,600-square-foot office at 312 North May Street.Cresa has about 80 offices in the U.S., Europe and Asia.

James McNerney retired from the aerospace giant as chairman in 2016, and had been CEO for a decade. The French country-style home has five bedrooms and eight bathrooms. It was built in 1930 and sits about a block away from the shores of Lake Michigan. The 2.25-acre property includes a guest house, lap pool and a wine cellar.The McNerney’s decision to sell at the reduced price reflects the Chicago luxury market’s overall struggles. Home sales fell sharply last year and that slide continued in the first month of 2020.But that hasn’t stopped some homeowners from listing their luxury properties far above what they sold them for. In Hinsdale, a couple recently put their 12,000-square-foot Hillcrest Avenue mansion on the market for just under $6 million. They bought it for $3.3 million in 2014.Also bucking the trend are condo units in JDL Development’s Gold Coast condo tower No. 9 Walton. The building recently sold out, and some of its owners — celebrities included — have been flipping units for tidy profits in the last year.

The deal marks the completion of a conversion of 122 hotel rooms — a quarter of the 500 previously there — into 78 studio and one-bedroom timeshare units that Orlando-based Hilton Grand Vacations agreed to buy in phases for $54 million.The four bulk sales of timeshare units posted in Cook County records since that agreement was made with Hilton Grand total just $45 million, and a termination of the timeshare sales agreement was also recently filed on the property along with Hilton Grand’s latest closing on a $15 million chunk of units.Related and Hilton Grand didn’t respond to requests for comment on the discrepancy nor the final cost of the conversion project, which was started well before the pandemic bludgeoned travel. Chicago’s tourism sector has lagged the recovery of other cities, yet records show dozens of timeshares have been sold by Hilton Grand for prices as much as the low six figures over the past two years. The property’s overall performance since its repositioning isn’t clear.Related wrested control of the property from San Francisco’s Chartres Lodging Group, which gave its lender the keys in 2018 in lieu of battling a foreclosure after defaulting on debt, although it remained an investor in the property.Chartres’ ownership was stymied by an expanding supply of Chicago hotel rooms last decade. Some 6,000 were added between 2014 and 2017, when its Ohio Street property fell into distress just after the company lost two other Chicago hotels to foreclosure.Oversupply remains a factor in the recovery from the health crisis and was cited by California’s Sunstone for its decision to sell two Hilton-operated hotels in Chicago for $130 million this year, a big drop from their pre-pandemic valuations.Hilton Grand last year also bought a Midtown Manhattan hotel under development while the property was in distress for $58 million from a lender.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",300 East Ohio Street,Related exited, ownership of the top floors of a downtown Chicago hotel it seized in 2018 after making a $92 million foreclosure complaint against its previous owner.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/06/17/related-exits-top-floors-of-chicago-hilton-seized-in-distress/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Related exited</a> ownership of the top floors of a downtown Chicago hotel it seized in 2018 after making a $92 million foreclosure complaint against its previous owner.","300 East Ohio Street Chicago, IL","300 E Ohio St, Chicago, IL 60611, USA","(41.8930872, -87.619834, 0.0)",41.8930872,-87.619834,0.0,2022

It had been in Itasca for 26 years.

Several attorneys told him that other condo associations around Chicago were scrambling to get their votes through before the deadline.“Having gone through this process hundreds of times over the last five years, I can tell you that it’s very, very difficult to get over 85 percent,” Livaditis said, estimating that only about half of the deals that he’s closed have exceeded that threshold.Deconversions, or turning condos into rental apartments, have tripled in dollar volume yearly in Chicago since 2016 — but this year, the market is highly unlikely to see any growth at all, according to an analysis by The Real Deal.1250 North LaSalle Drive (Credit: Coldwell Banker Homes)The full City Council approved the ordinance last month, with co-sponsor Alderman Brendan Reilly calling it a protection against displacement for longtime residents. The new, higher threshold for owner approval on bulk condo sales went into effect on Wednesday.The smart mathThe Chicago deconversion market has drawn investors who are seeking the upside in renovating older apartments at market-rate rents, but don’t want the risk or the higher costs of ground-up development. Often, investors already own a high number of units in the condo building before lodging an official deconversion bid, a way of ensuring a majority vote.Essex Realty’s Steven LivaditisFor them, the math is simple: ground-up development in Chicago can easily hit $400 a square foot. But a savvy investor can take control of a condo building, renovate the units, find tenants and get liquidity flowing in just months. All for under $300 a foot in a hot rental market.But it’s not for the meek — competition can be fierce and the condo owners are often unwilling sellers. Earlier this month, condo owners at Lake Point Tower beat back an effort to force a deconversion of the 758-unit high-rise, prohibiting any individual owner from controlling more than 2 percent of units.Investors are mostly targeting properties where they are sure the owners will be eager to cut a deal, said Interra Realty broker Joe Smazal, who has completed at least eight deconversion deals. Sellers can achieve a 25 percent premium on the value of their home, and they’re often motivated to sell if the building needs repairs and has deferred maintenance, said Avison Young’s Jim Hanson, who commissioned a study on deconversions in Chicago.Those types of deals were already becoming rare before the new rules took effect, according to property investor David Ruttenberg. “It’s been a quieter year,” he said. “The low-hanging peaches have been picked.”Bigger deals, but fewer of themIn 2016, buyers collectively spent $53.5 million on condo deconversions. Since then, that amount has tripled each year, totaling $523 million in 2018, according to a TRD analysis of closed property transactions and brokers’ sales records. But through September 2019, only $240.5 million in deconversions had been announced (many have not closed). At this rate, 2019 sales will likely check in around the $300 million mark — a little more than half of last year’s total, according to our analysis.Investors who are closing deals are stomaching higher prices — per unit costs this year are up 10 percent over last year, our analysis found.2 East Oak Street (Credit: Google Maps)The upward pressure on prices at a time when “skyrocketing” property assessments have upped taxes, said Livaditis, and the prospect of rate hikes in Illinois have driven down the confidence of investors and developers alike, despite continued demand from the Chicago rental market.“That’s the No. 1 concern for investors in the city of Chicago that can significantly hurt or benefit deconversion,” said Livaditis, who is the principal and managing director of Essex.Since 2016, the number of transactions has not grown as aggressively as the dollar volume and number of units purchased, suggesting a slight trend toward fewer but bigger purchases.“It started with the smaller deconversions in the neighborhoods, then it moved to the downtown market. And with that, the properties got much larger,” said Integra Realty’s Gail Lissner, who specializes in deconversion sales.David RuttenbergRuttenberg, who’s the managing partner at Ruttenberg Gordon Investments and principal at Marc Realty Capital, was involved in the largest deconversion in Chicago’s history when just over 75 percent of owners voted in favor of deconverting the 449-unit River City building in the South Loop. Due to the scale of the building, he wonders where $90.5 million deal would’ve stood if it had to reach the 85 percent threshold because that means the owners of about 45 additional condos would’ve had to be on board.Livaditis believes deconversions in Chicago will continue, but not with the same velocity seen over recent years.“There’s no question, but there needs to be better transparency and clarity between all of the parties involved so everyone fully understands the pluses and minuses of going through this process,” he said. “I think 85 percent is a very high barter reach, but I think it is possible if you have the right support, meaning if the deal does make sense.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1250 North LaSalle Drive,Essex Realty’s," Steven Livaditis may have been the last broker in Chicago to close a condo deconversion deal during its glory days, when only 75 percent of sellers had to approve a bulk sale.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/10/17/the-chicago-condo-deconversion-craze-is-dying/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Essex Realty’s</a> Steven Livaditis may have been the last broker in Chicago to close a condo deconversion deal during its glory days, when only 75 percent of sellers had to approve a bulk sale.","1250 North LaSalle Drive Chicago, IL","1250 N La Salle St, Chicago, IL 60610, USA","(41.905309, -87.6336378, 0.0)",41.905309,-87.6336378,0.0,2019

07:30 AM",A multifamily landlord in Chicago faces growing opposition to plans to buy suburban condo buildings and turn them into rentals after a two-year housing boom left few affordable options for condo unit owners who sell.,"[""Brian Cunat with 4300 West Shamrock Lane in McHenry and an aerial of Cunat Court in Lake in the Hills (Materra Wines, Cunat, Google Maps)A multifamily landlord in Chicago faces growing opposition to plans to buy suburban condo buildings and turn them into rentals after a two-year housing boom left few affordable options for condo unit owners who sell.Cunat, a suburban landlord and multifamily developer, has a pending offer of just under $34 million on a condo complex of about 300 units named Prairie Point in the village of Lake in the Hills, a distant northwest suburb. That’s an increase of almost $4 million from a previous offer that condo owners rejected. It also follows Cunat’s offer of $11 million for a condo complex in nearby McHenry, the Greens of Irish Prairie, that was supported by the required 75 percent of condo unit owners but is now being challenged in court.“These are never easy deals to do,” said Gail Lissner, managing director of Integra Realty Resources in Chicago. “It really takes a buyer with expertise in the field. It’s not like buying a stabilized apartment asset.”Successfully – and profitably – converting condos to rentals is complicated even further by Chicago’s housing boom, which has driven prices up by more than 10 percent. Some of the biggest gains have come in the suburbs as buyers seek better accommodations to work from home during the pandemic.While Cunat’s offers might look good on paper, in practice, the unit owners would struggle to find comparable housing. At least one owner says the law entitles sellers to funding for replacement housing on top of what they get for a sale. That could amount to tens of thousands of dollars per condo owner and further upend the market for deconversions.Cunat, which owns properties with thousands of apartment units throughout the Chicago suburbs, is seeking to buy condo complexes it developed with hundreds of units each in McHenry and Lake in the Hills to turn into units exclusively for lease.Cunat didn’t return requests for comment.The company made its offer for the McHenry complex in September, and it was approved by its owners, who included a large portion of votes that were already held or acquired by Cunat through individual condo unit purchases within the last 18 months.Two residents who objected are now being sued by the property’s condo board, which has alleged they refused to comply with the terms of the sale by not signing closing documents and continuing to live in their condos, and seeks to compel them to accept the sale and move out or lease their units back.“Next month it’ll be a year I’m in limbo land, paying for a condo that’s going to be stolen from me,” said Ken Dill, one of the holdout owners in McHenry. He would get just $66,500 for his unit, down almost 28 percent from the $92,000 he paid in 2007, if the Cunat deconversion deal closes.Dill says that under a 2018 amendment to the Illinois law governing condo building sales, he’s entitled to receive replacement housing costs from the proceeds of the sale in addition to what he gets for his individual unit.His argument may have merit, according to R. Kymn Harp, an Illinois real estate attorney who doesn’t represent Dill. There’s little case law involving the amendment, Harp said.Hearings in the lawsuits against Dill and the other McHenry holdout are set for Feb. 10.Median home prices in Chicago’s nine-county metro area, which includes the condo projects Cunat is eyeing, gained 8.7 percent in December 2021 over the same time the previous year, rising to $288,000, according to the trade group Illinois Realtors, and the supply of homes hitting the market has tightened, a trend Coldwell Banker’s Dawn McKenna told The Real Deal she expects to continue to drive prices up in the suburbs in 2022.With condo units selling for about $100,000 in Lake in the Hills and less than that in McHenry as part of the proposed deconversion sales, there would be little else owners could buy for similar prices in the suburban market, where condo deconversions are generally trickier to complete because residents have fewer replacement housing options, said Andy Friedman, director of Kiser Group, a mid-market multi-family brokerage in Chicago.Even if the prices were 30 percent higher, residents would still have little available to them at that price, and may have to enter the rental market if they intend to stay in the suburbs, he said. For that reason, Cunat, if it completes the deconversions, would be “feeding its own rental market” with any displaced condo unit residents, Friedman said.“I can’t buy anything nearby with that $130,000,’’ Friedman said. That’s not something a broker can fix. I can solve a lot of problems through a deconversion, but I can’t create available condo housing in the suburbs.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",4300 West Shamrock Lane,A multifamily, landlord in Chicago faces growing opposition to plans to buy suburban condo buildings and turn them into rentals after a two-year housing boom left few affordable options for condo unit owners who sell.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/02/04/condo-deconversions-hit-roadblocks-in-chicago-suburbs/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A multifamily</a> landlord in Chicago faces growing opposition to plans to buy suburban condo buildings and turn them into rentals after a two-year housing boom left few affordable options for condo unit owners who sell.","4300 West Shamrock Lane Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2022

Of the 6.5 million square feet of office space under construction, less than half had been pre-leased, according to the report.New York-based Vista is already deeply invested in Chicago, with 19 properties that comprise a majority of its 34 holdings.In December, the company paid $17 million for a 48,000-square-foot brick office building at 435 N. LaSalle Drive, Crain’s reported. The seller was investor Michael Palumbo and Skokie-based Elmdale Partners.\nIn June 2018, Vista bought a 35,000-square-foot office building in Fulton Market from Sterling Bay, paying $13.6 million.

Vivid is taking less than half the space it planned to lease before the pandemic, when like many companies it reduced its footprint.The firm plans to move into 24 E. Washington Street, on the building’s south side, in 2023. Its lease at 111 N. Canal Street, ends in November.Vivid is down to 40,000 square feet at Canal Street, compared with 90,000 square feet\nbetween there and an expired sublease on W. Randolph Street, according to CoStar Group data cited by Crain’s. Vivid employs 265 people in Chicago.Vivid’s decision also reflects the premium companies are putting on amenities. The gym and rooftop deck and lounge that Toronto-based developer Brownfield Properties added to the Marshall Field building helped draw Vivid Seats out of the trendier West Loop neighborhood, CBRE’s Brad Serot, who negotiated the lease on behalf of Vivid, told Crain’s.“Our new headquarters is not just an investment in Chicago’s growing tech sector, it’s an investment in our current and future employees,” a Vivid spokesperson said in a statement to Crain’s. “This space will support a larger workforce and hybrid model with shared and collaborative workspaces.”Its departure from Canal Street presents a challenge for JPMorgan, which owns the 16-story Gogo Building building. Namesake tenant Gogo put a third of its space up for sublease in 2019 and Uber recently left the building. JPMorgan tried to evict Potbelly, a sandwich chain, from the building in 2020, That issue was resolved and Potbelly remains at the location even after the landlord said it owed more than $800,000 in unpaid rent.[Crain’s] – Harrison ConneryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",24 E.

Like Bond Collective, No18 says it offers an elevated co-working experience, billing itself as a “cosmopolitan members’ club for business.”Chicago’s co-working industry has tripled in four years, with shared-office firms now controlling about 2 percent of the Downtown office market. The growth does not appear to be slowing, thanks in no small part to industry leader WeWork’s continued expansion in the city.

LaSalle in Chicago (Brookfield Properties, Loopnet)Lenders are taking control of two big office buildings in the Chicago Loop that were struggling before the pandemic and have fallen further behind on their loans.Loop office landlord defaults on the riseCanada’s Brookfield Asset Management is turning over its 22-floor, 1.4 million-square-foot building at 175 West Jackson Boulevard to its lender after becoming delinquent on a $258 million loan, which was sent to special servicing in November, Bisnow reported earlier, citing loan data tracker Trepp.Its occupancy was just 63 percent as of January, according to a Morningstar analysis of the loan, for which LNR Partners is special servicer.Another distressed property in the Loop, 135 South LaSalle Street, owned by New York-based AmTrust Realty, is also set to have its deed handed to a special servicer, after falling behind on payments toward a $100 million loan, Bisnow reported, citing Trepp. The loan’s special servicer is Torchlight Investors, which has agreed to skip filing a foreclosure suit if it gets keys to the LaSalle building, a transaction in negotiations, Crain’s reported, citing Bloomberg data.The seizures by the lenders are the most prominent examples of how Chicago’s office market has been slammed by the coronavirus. The rise of remote work drained the pool of potential replacement tenants for properties that were already facing the loss of large leases ahead of the health crisis, and there could be more trouble ahead in Chicago and across the nation if leaseholders decide to shrink their footprints.While pedestrian counts are up in downtown areas of Chicago, San Francisco and Houston, exciting retailers, office landlords don’t yet have much to celebrate as workers were entering offices at just 41 percent of 2019 levels in the country’s 10 largest office markets as of March 9, according to Kastle, which provides commercial real estate security equipment and software. Many professionals expect to enter the office just three days a week even as the pandemic eases, which could give companies reason to shrink their footprints in downtown buildings.The LaSalle property, known as the Field Building, was hurt by longtime tenant Bank of America’s decision to vacate 830,000 square feet last year to move into its namesake tower, a 57-story building at 110 North Wacker Drive. The value of Field has dropped by $200 million to about $130 million since 2015, leaving the property owner just above water on its loan, according to The Real Deal reporting on a recent appraisal.“[AmTrust’s] apparent willingness to hand over keys is also an obvious negative. There are challenges in the market that will contribute to lower demand for the asset,” Morningstar’s latest report on the LaSalle property said.Brookfield paid $306 million for the Jackson Boulevard property in 2018 and is walking away after failing to restructure its debt in talks with LNR, property records show. Its largest tenant is Enova International, which leases 168,000 square feet and has the space until 2027.[Bisnow] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",175 Jackson Blvd,Lenders are taking, control of two big office buildings in the Chicago Loop that were struggling before the pandemic and have fallen further behind on their loans.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/03/17/lenders-taking-control-of-big-loop-office-buildings/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Lenders are taking</a> control of two big office buildings in the Chicago Loop that were struggling before the pandemic and have fallen further behind on their loans.","175 Jackson Blvd Chicago, IL","175 W Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60604, USA","(41.8772757, -87.63321230000001, 0.0)",41.8772757,-87.63321230000001,0.0,2022

The eminent domain action came after the chocolate company’s offer to buy Eychaner’s land for $825,000 was rejected, according to the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin.Eychaner fought the use of eminent domain to seize his land, setting off a years-long legal battle over the property and its value. A court upheld the city’s use of eminent domain in the case, but it rejected the city’s assessment of the land’s value, according to reports.Eventually a jury awarded Eychaner $2.5 million for the land, but he appealed that amount.The battle culminated with a judge’s order to award Eychaner $7.1 million plus interest, according to a court order issued Dec. 18.Eychaner, a businessman and philanthropist who founded printing company Newsweb, could not be reached for comment, and his attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Chicago Department of Law did not immediately return a request seeking comment.The area of River West that includes the Blommer Chocolate factory and Eychaner’s former land has undergone a transformation since the legal saga began.In 2016, Akara Partners and CA Ventures completed a 227-unit apartment tower in the neighborhood, a property the partners listed for the second time this fall. A block north, Tandem Partners and Rambaud Holdings are building a 23-story mixed-use project at 730 North Milwaukee Avenue.Also nearby, Tribune Media Company is planning a redevelopment of its printing plant into a 30-acre campus with up to 9 million square feet of residential, retail and office space.The family that owned Blommer Chocolate Co. sold the company late last year to Japan-based Fuji Oil Holdings.

State Street (Credit: Google Maps)As landlords braced for a huge drop in April rent payments amid the coronavirus-fueled meltdown, Rampante Realty Partners saw that fear hit home.The investment firm is now suing the anchor tenant at its Loop office building, Robert Morris University, for skipping out on a $1 million April rent payment, according to Crain’s.But Covid-19 wasn’t the only factor in the university’s decision not to pay.Robert Morris has leased 355,000 square feet at Rampante Realty’s 401 S. State St. location since 1996. The university vacated the eight-story building recently, after it was acquired by Roosevelt University.Rampante Realty’s suit also names Roosevelt University as a defendant. As the 487,000-square-foot building’s only tenant, Robert Morris left the location empty, still owing what would amount to “tens of millions of dollars” in rent payments for the remaining four years on the lease, Crain’s cited in the lawsuit.Rampante Realty’s suit in Cook County court comes more than a year after the investment firm listed the historic office property for $100 million. That amount is a significant markup from the company’s $68 million purchase in 2016 — it did put $5 million in improvements into the building.Unable to unload the prime asset despite a strong office market, Rampante Realty now finds itself in hot water with creditors for its own missed April payment. The company helped pay for the building with a $48 million acquisition loan, and has skipped out on a $168,000 April debt service obligation, Crain’s reported, citing Bloomberg. Its creditors are Wells Fargo and Morrison Street Capital.\nMeanwhile, Roosevelt University was given the go-ahead to purchase Robert Morris, as both schools tried to bolster their sagging enrollment and sinking financials. Chicago-based Roosevelt University in late 2018 sold off 125,000 square feet of space at the Gauge Building on Michigan Avenue to National St. Louis University for $15 million.

The short-term rental company Sonder purchased 92 units in the building soon after it was completed last year.The building’s sale comes at a time when commercial real estate deals have dropped off since the onset of the pandemic as investors remain uncertain about pricing and occupancy.At the same time, Chicago’s rental market has surged in recent years, driven by a number of large companies — including Google and McDonald’s — opening local headquarters and flagships in the city.Developers were increasingly converting condo developments into apartments in a process known as “condo deconversion.” But deconversions in Chicago have become tougher after the city passed a rule that requires 85 percent of a building’s condo owners to approve a bulk sale, up from 75 percent.Nationally, landlords are starting to show some financial strains. About 6 million renters reported either missing, delaying or paying reduced rent during the second quarter of the year, according to a recent report from the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Non-profit developer LUCHA, the Spanish word for struggle, aims to improve housing for low-income Latin and African-American communities.“Affordable housing is a human right,” said Lisette Castañeda, LUCHA executive director. “It really says that for our communities, this is what’s important, and our elected officials are listening to us.”A project aimed at combating gentrification-fueled displacement, church leaders partnered with LUCHA to renovate the Humboldt Park Methodist Church, home to existing 12 apartments, and add 10 units. The City Council approved the project in December 2020, but the $11 million project needs about $7 million more in addition to the existing funds from the government and the state.Initially built for a German congregation in 1928, the Spanish-speaking Humboldt Park United Methodist took over the church in 1968 and has become a community hub offering free legal aid to immigrants. In 1989, the congregation started a ministry helping the homeless and built 10 affordable housing apartments as displacement pressures continued to mount.“We as a congregation have lost our Latinx families who have been displaced out of this neighborhood through the evils of gentrification, Paula Cripps-Vallejo, Humboldt Park United Methodist Church’s reverend previously said.\nThe apartments, consisting of studios, one-, two-, and three-bedrooms, will be available only for households earning up to 60 percent of the area median income, the city’s requirements under the Affordable Requirements Ordinance.LUCHA was one of the 10 developers awarded funding with support from Representative Jesús García. Other projects that were granted federal funds include St. Anthony Hospital, which received $923,000 to build a campus in Little Village and Brighton Park Neighborhood Council that was awarded about $1 million to set up a new community center.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2122 North Mozart Street,A Logan Square, church project in Chicago received $2 million in federal funds for affordable apartment conversions.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/03/21/logan-square-church-project-receives-2m-for-affordable-apartment-conversions/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A Logan Square</a> church project in Chicago received $2 million in federal funds for affordable apartment conversions.","2122 North Mozart Street Chicago, IL","2122 N Mozart St, Chicago, IL 60647, USA","(41.9203775, -87.69888259999999, 0.0)",41.9203775,-87.69888259999999,0.0,2022

It already has offices in the area, comprising the entire 230,000-square-foot Sterling Bay building at 320 North Morgan Street, and another lease at 210 North Carpenter Street for a total of 500,000 square feet in the area.Trammell Crow developed the 425,000-square-foot building at 400 North Aberdeen on speculation with no tenants signed in advance, meaning the Google lease is another boon for Fulton Market. The area landed top-tier tenants even through the pandemic and is the city’s only office district where vacancies declined during the crisis.Google’s commitment Wednesday to physical workplaces – its parent company plans a $9.5 billion investment in offices and data centers, up from $7.5 billion last year – is also good news for wider downtown office markets struggling with vacancies. Its move to 320 North Morgan almost a decade ago sparked corporate migrations to the former Chicago meatpacking district now teeming with busy retail between shiny new office towers.Google could even further expand from the 200,000 square feet it is considering on Aberdeen. It aims to keep hiring in Chicago to add its 1,800 local employees, with several hundred hired in the last two years and plans to add more, Crain’s reported.Even more Chicago square footage could have been occupied by the company if not for the pandemic. It had a deal with Sterling Bay to build a new 18-story building at 1000 West Carroll Avenue that Google would have owned, but it was shelved as the pandemic struck Illinois in 2020, Crain’s reported, citing a 2020 lawsuit involving the former Ace Hotel near the site.Trammell Crow landing Google is also a shift from the tenants it was expecting at the site. The 16-story structure was built as a life sciences lab, and remains mostly empty after its completion earlier this year.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",400 North Aberdeen Street,Google is looking at, expanding its Chicago office footprint.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/04/15/google-nearing-fulton-market-expansion/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Google is looking at</a> expanding its Chicago office footprint.","400 North Aberdeen Street Chicago, IL","400 N Aberdeen St, Chicago, IL 60642, USA","(41.8891552, -87.6550543, 0.0)",41.8891552,-87.6550543,0.0,2022

One local developer is betting it can.Gary Pachucki is working to redevelop three warehouse buildings in the 1300 block of North Kostner Avenue into a mixed-use complex, featuring retail and “creative work space” the developer is calling Humboldt Lit.The loft-style office space will be marketed toward companies in creative fields, which may have been priced out of Fulton Market years ago, said Pachucki, who leads development firm IBT Group.“We’re trying to provide a vertical creative work environment that doesn’t exist in Chicago,” Pachucki said. Cowley Chicago’s urban development team will market the new office space. The buildout is being spearheaded by Ratio Architects.IBT Group is under contract for the three warehouse facilities currently occupied by a furniture company, Pachucki said. The total project is slated to cost about $50 million, including potential extensive buildouts for technology firms.The plan is to turn the 6-plus-acre property into a campus-style office development with 240,000 square feet of space dedicated to retail and office uses. The space could accommodate a number of tenants, or have a single tenant, Pachucki said. He envisions uses like a coffee shop and a bike store. There will be about 1 acre of outdoor space.The booming Fulton Market, which home to trendy restaurants and hotels, along with gleaming office towers, already commands the most expensive rental rates of any submarket. Increasingly, traditional corporate tenants — like Ernst & Young — have moved into the neighborhood.Humboldt Park is an increasingly popular neighborhood, at least for homeowners, with the neighborhood seeing escalating home values and tax bills.Fulton Market’s office and residential developments have steadily inched westward, with projects popping up closer to Ashland Avenue.This is not IBT Group’s first foray into the speculative West Side development game. In 2009, the firm purchased a 4-acre warehouse in the 1100 block of West Jackson Boulevard with plans for 300 residences, a Mariano’s and a movie theater. With the recession throttling development, IBT’s financing partners backed out, though the firm helped to develop a Target store on the site.Pachucki also hasn’t abandoned Fulton Market entirely, The firm has a project in the works there, though it was too early to discuss.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1300 block of North Kostner Avenue,Chicago’s central," business district has been creeping westward for years, but can it get as far west as Humboldt Park?

Many of those sales were in the suburbs, where families opt for more space post-pandemic.Inside the property (Compass)Seven Hinsdale homes sold for at least $4 million in the past three years.

One, on Forest Place, is listed for $5.2 million. The other, on Church Street, is listed for $4.2 million.She’s also listing a three-flat on Lake Shore Drive in Lakeview for $4.8 million — $4 million less than she paid for it, according to Crain’s.Kimberlee Carr at Tawani’s in-house brokerage Honnete Real Estate has the listings.In March she sold a 4,000-square-foot home on Judson Avenue in Evanston for $1.2 million, and listed a 19th century rowhouse at 1234 North State Parkway in Chicago for $4 million. In February she listed a Winnetka mansion for $3.9 million.Last year she put on the market another Evanston mansion for $2 million, and has since lowered the asking price below $1.6 million. The home has a contingent contract with a buyer, according to Crain’s.Pritzker, who retired from the Army in 2001 as a lieutenant colonel, is part of the Pritzker family of billionaires that includes her cousins, Gov. J.B. Pritzker, and former U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker.

The joint venture also sold the Embassy Suites Rosemont for $24.4 million. The deals closed in late May.By selling the two properties for a total $52.8 million, the joint venture took a significant loss. The venture bought the hotels in two separate deals for a combined $100 million, not including money spent on upgrades, property records show.New Jersey-based PGIM and Seattle-based Dow Hotel bought the 369-key DoubleTree at 5460 North River Road in 2007 in a land lease deal for $61.4 million, according to property records. In 2000, the group picked up the 294-room Embassy Suites at 5500 North River Road for $39 million before spending $10 million in renovations.Minnesota-based Nath Companies and Chicago-based Syndicated Equities Group bought the two hotels from PGIM and Dow last month. TCF Bank provided two loans totaling $46.3 million to finance the deals, records show.The sales come as the O’Hare hotel submarket is riding high. Revenue per available room in the O’Hare market jumped 6 percent year over year last summer, and the airport itself is in the midst of an $8.5 billion expansion and overhaul that will allow it to serve an additional 20 million passengers per year and potentially bring in more guests to area hotels.The O’Hare market even withstood a downturn that hit the overall Chicago hotel industry in the first quarter, and it has not seen an influx of new hotel inventory as Downtown has, hotel consultant Ted Mandigo said.The O’Hare market had even better years leading up to the recession. That, combined with a lack of available sites for new hotels, caused some buyers to pay top-dollar for hotel properties in the market at the time, Mandigo said.PGIM and Dow bought the DoubleTree in 2007, just before the recession. If it sold near its previous price of $61 million, it would have been the priciest O’Hare hotel deal since 2015, when the Westin O’Hare traded for $82 million.Since then, the highest price paid for a hotel in the submarket came in March 2018, when a Hong Kong firm paid $37 million for the Rosemont Hilton as part of a $650 portfolio sale.The value of properties in the are has dropped so much because many are in need of improvements, Mandigo said. And the expansion and redevelopment of O’Hare could make matters worse for existing innkeepers by increasing competition: The project could bring as many as three new hotels to the area, he said.“It’s a very competitive market,” said Mandigo, of TR Mandigo & Company. “There are a number of projects that could come on board. That dampened the enthusiasm of some.”PGIM declined to comment on the deal, and Dow Hotel did not respond to requests for comment. A representative for Nath Companies did not respond to requests for comment. A principal at Syndicated confirmed the company’s preferred equity interest in the deal, but did not disclose the terms of the deal.Nath Companies’ first acquisition in Chicago was in 2017, when the firm picked up the 385-room Renaissance Chicago North Shore in Northbrook for $30 million, Crain’s reported at the time. Syndicated Equities has a diverse portfolio, including retail, office and eight hotels throughout the country.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",5460 North River Road,Nine months after," seeking to cash out of the area’s strong hotel market, a joint venture led by Prudential Insurance’s real estate investment arm sold two Rosemont hotels at a deep discount.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/06/11/prudential-led-jv-sells-2-rosemont-hotels-at-deep-discount/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Nine months after</a> seeking to cash out of the area’s strong hotel market, a joint venture led by Prudential Insurance’s real estate investment arm sold two Rosemont hotels at a deep discount.","5460 North River Road Chicago, IL","5460 N River Rd, Rosemont, IL 60018, USA","(41.97842259999999, -87.8633768, 0.0)",41.97842259999999,-87.8633768,0.0,2019

Van Buren St. Other notable tenants include the Chicago Board Options Exchange, AbelsonTaylor and the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning.“We’ve created an urban oasis that complements the exceptional tenant amenity package that The Old Post Office offers,” said Brian Whiting, president and CEO of Telos Group, according to Crain’s. Telos oversees leasing at the massive building.The Old Post Office is 80-percent leased, but it remains to be seen how the added amenities will help fill the vacant space. Chicago’s office market has sunk and vacancy rates have shot up. Several companies have exited leases in recent months, canceled plans to take more space or downsized their existing square footage.Many companies are still operating remotely, including Cars.com, which recently decided to unload a third of its West Loop office space by subleasing.Meanwhile, at the Old Post Office, Uber temporarily paused construction on its 463,000 square feet of space, and now plans to move in next year instead of this fall, according to Chicago Tribune.

Kushner wanted $315 million when it put the building on the market in 2014, according to Crain’s. Real Estate Alert was the first to report on the deal.Kushner paid $276 million for the 853,000-square-foot building in a 2007 sale-leaseback deal with AT&T, whose 670,000-square-foot lease expires at the end of 2022.Joining Angelo Gordon in the deal are Chicago investor AJ Capital and a New York venture of former Angelo Gordon executive Ryan Klenovich, according to Crain’s.White House ethics investigators launched a probe after Apollo Global Management refinanced the building with a $184 million loan after an Apollo executive had meetings at the White House with presidential adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, part of a larger package of loans from Apollo.Kushner spokespeople at the time denied any impropriety in the loans. A spokesperson for Kushner did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.Angelo Gordon has stakes in several Chicago-area properties, and earlier this year teamed with Chicago-based GlenStar Properties in April to buy the Presidents Plaza office towers near O’Hare Airport for $148 million.AJ Capital was a joint investor with Shapack Partners in the Soho House property in Fulton Market.

There is no published asking price, Stern said.But a lawyer for MCZ Development, which owns a number of units in the building, said it will oppose the sale.“They might as well throw in the Brooklyn Bridge and the Sears Tower” into the offering, attorney Bill Choslovsky told Crain’s. “They can’t deliver those and they can’t deliver this building.”MCZ last month sued the board, claiming it illegally changed the association’s rules to try to thwart the developer from buying more units in the building.Key to the spat will be how much of the building MCZ actually owns. Illinois law requires 75 percent of ownership to approve of a bulk sale of a condo building.Choslovsky said his client owns more than 25 percent. Crain’s could only find Cook County records showing 24 condos owned by MCZ, though another attorney for the firm previously said the number was 31, with several more under contract.But the 75 percent threshold is based on the total value of the condominium, not on the total number of units, making it more unclear if MCZ owns the 25 percent of the building to block the sale.Representatives of the association did not respond to requests for comment from Crain’s.

The building includes a mix of studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms renting from $1,492 to $3,216. CA and Giles took out a $51 million construction loan in 2016 to finance the project.This is Diamond Realty’s first multifamily acquisition in the Chicago market, according to its website. The California-based firm also owns two student housing complexes and 14 industrial properties throughout the state. Diamond Realty could not be reached for comment.The Eleven40 deal is just the latest sell-off for CA.Earlier this year, CA and Akara Partners sold a 227-unit River West complex to Newcastle for $85 million. The developers originally tried to sell the complex in 2017 but pulled it off the market after failing to get their price.The team of CA and Giles sold their South Loop student housing complex in October to DWS Group for $76.8 million.Even as it’s sold off some of its local holdings, CA is continuing to invest and develop in the market. The firm is working to build a 261-unit apartment building in Old Town. It has also launched an industrial division, promising to invest $500 million in the markets across the country.A representative for CA did not immediately return a request for comment.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1140 South Wabash Avenue,CA Ventures found a, buyer for its new 26-story South Loop apartment complex as the firm continues to shed residential buildings from its portfolio.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/04/03/ca-ventures-sells-newly-delivered-south-loop-apartment-complex/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">CA Ventures found a</a> buyer for its new 26-story South Loop apartment complex as the firm continues to shed residential buildings from its portfolio.","1140 South Wabash Avenue Chicago, IL","1140 S Wabash Ave, Chicago, IL 60605, USA","(41.8680418, -87.6262789, 0.0)",41.8680418,-87.6262789,0.0,2019

The Tribune also is partnering with Riverside Investment & Development to continue the project on seven acres north of Chicago Avenue. The commission approved that plan separately earlier this year.The planned development approved Thursday outlines 14 buildings up to 650 feet tall scattered across the property and buffeted by green space, but details of each building have not been finalized. A press release last year predicted up to 5,900 residential units and 19,000 permanent jobs on the site by the time the entire development is fully realized.As part of the multi-year project, the city approved a plan to extend Jefferson Street through the center of the campus as a main thoroughfare.The developer also has vowed to create a publicly accessible riverwalk promenade along its entire 3,200-foot waterfront edge.The first phase of the plan proposes four towers combining for 1,500 apartments between Grand and Erie Street, at the south end of the site. Construction would get underway in early 2020, with the goal of accepting the first tenants by the end of 2021.The entire 37-acre development’s “master plan” will include 20 percent of apartments rented below market rate in accordance with the affordability “pilot zones” created by the city last year. []The developer will also take advantage of the city’s Downtown density bonus program to build with a higher floor-area ratio than would be otherwise permitted under the site’s zoning. In return, Tribune Media will pay about $13 million into the city’s fund for business improvement grants on the city’s South and West Sides.Members of the commission Thursday raised concerns over the development’s potential to clog traffic in the area, but a representative for Tribune Media said the company had worked with city transportation planners to add street extensions and connections that would help area roads absorb more cars.The site sits across the river from Groupon’s 16.5 million-square-foot headquarters at 600 West Chicago Avenue, which Sterling Bay bought earlier this year for $510 million.The Tribune site also faces the southern tip of Goose Island, where the Onni Group recently backed out of a bid to build apartments on the site of Greyhound’s 8-acre bus facility.Developers have swung their focus hard to the city’s North Branch Corridor since the city adopted a mass rezoning last year to encourage the construction of homes and offices on the traditionally industrial-dominated riverfront.Farther north on the river, Sterling Bay has plans for a sprawling mega-development of its own, Lincoln Yards. The Chicago-based developer is currently working through the approval process for that project with community groups and Alderman Brian Hopkins (2nd).All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",777 West Chicago Avenue,The real estate arm," of the Tribune Media Company won preliminary approval to build a 30-acre campus with up to 9 million square feet of homes, stores and offices on the site of its Freedom Center printing plant in River West.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/10/18/tribune-medias-plans-for-30-acre-slice-of-river-district-win-city-approval/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The real estate arm</a> of the Tribune Media Company won preliminary approval to build a 30-acre campus with up to 9 million square feet of homes, stores and offices on the site of its Freedom Center printing plant in River West.","777 West Chicago Avenue Chicago, IL","777 W Chicago Ave, Chicago, IL 60654, USA","(41.8954383, -87.6456267, 0.0)",41.8954383,-87.6456267,0.0,2018

The lender made the claim a month after Madison Realty Capital filed a similar lawsuit, alleging that Symmetry owes about $8.7 million, including interest and late fees, after missing payments.The foreclosure bids are the latest problem for the New York-based development firm, which is also facing a lawsuit from 60 Chinese investors demanding to know what happened to the nearly $50 million they pumped into the project through the federal EB-5 program.The developer is also still seeking support from Alderman Brendan Reilly (42nd), who last year downzoned the property to block the proposal. And a city commission gave preliminary approval in March for a proposal by preservationists to landmark the existing buildings on the site, which would hamstring any development.Symmetry maintains that it did not default on its debt, and it denies any other wrongdoing. A spokesperson told Crain’s that the firm “continues to work with the alderman’s office to get the project approved and believes it will ultimately be successful in doing so.”The proposed tower would include 246 condos, 216 hotel rooms and 120 timeshare units.

Those new stations will create more foot traffic in South Side neighborhoods.“We’re talking about communities currently without these types of businesses and without a lot of people visiting the area because of limited public transportation,” Karen Freeman-Wilson, president and CEO of the Chicago Urban League, told the Business Journal. “But just as equally important to strengthening the economy on the Far South Side is more housing built.

10:52 AM","Between a new casino and a push for affordable housing, there’s plenty of interest in developing Chicago.","[""Between a new casino and a push for affordable housing, there’s plenty of interest in developing Chicago.More than 20 projects were added to the Windy City’s development pipeline in the first half of 2022, according to reporting by The Real Deal and other news outlets. Most are residential, a mix of high-end apartment and condominium projects in denser areas and community-focused affordable housing developments. Potential deals total about 16,000 units in the downtown market, said Integra Realty Resources Managing Director Gail Lissner.“Our downtown area has really taken off,” she told The Real Deal. “Neighborhoods like the West Loop didn’t exist in terms of residential before the 1990s,”There’s also big demand for affordable housing, but the problem is figuring out how to pay for it. Some of those projects in the pipeline are part of the city’s $1 billion affordable housing package.Here’s a look at some of the most notable projects.By far the largest development project in terms of both attention and dollars is Bally’s successful $1.74 billion bid to build the city’s first casino. The 30-acre site will also include a hotel, a 3,000-seat theater, an outdoor music venue and other amenities.Lissner said the casino will have a big impact on a neighborhood that was “a little bit more of a sleeper” in terms of residential development and likely spur other commercial development. The plan has so far inspired proposals for high-density high-rise development nearby, which River West hasn’t had before.Shapack Partners, which made its name spearheading the creation of Chicago’s Fulton Market, is now poised to be a major player around the casino. The developer paid $25 million for the Salvation Army’s downtown River West campus and its plans include a 141-key hotel, retail and restaurants on 3.25 acres, Chicago YIMBY reported. The master plan is divided into four parcels across five city blocks. Two designs include four towers and the other has five.Two other Shapack projects proposed this year include a $209 million mixed-use high-rise project at 170 North Green Street in partnership with CRG and adding two floors to its residential project at 1353 West Fulton Street.Also staking its claim to land near the casino is Vancouver, Canada-based Onni Group, which paid $45 million for a seven-acre property near the site. While Onni hasn’t revealed its plans, people familiar with the project said it’s likely to be residential. The site could accommodate as many as 1,000 apartments on 1.5 million square feet.Aiming to curb gentrification in the West Side neighborhood, Humboldt Park Health has proposed building about 300 affordable housing units. The health system broke ground on its new wellness center in June and owns about 60 percent of the land available around it.The real estate team behind the Englewood Square retail development has proposed a mixed-income housing project nearby. Built in two phases, Thrive Englewood will have 108 residential units, 10 of which will be affordable housing.Chicago’s Fern Hill is planning to develop a 34-story condo building in Gold Coast, the city’s epicenter of high end real estate, replacing an existing four story building on the site.One of Chicago’s oldest real estate companies plans to build a nine-story, 129-unit apartment building on the Near North Side on a 14,388-square-foot site. Twenty-six of those apartments will be marked as affordable housing.This joint venture is planning a 21-story apartment building for a corner lot in Streeterville, one block from the Magnificent Mile. The development will have 248 units and also include 41,000 square feet of office space and 8,000 feet of ground-floor retail.A development planned for the heart of Lincoln Square would bring 51 affordable housing units to the neighborhood.This pair of Chicago developers is planning a 362-unit high-rise apartment tower in the West Loop.The Chicago real estate investment firm plans to turn a vacant lot in Ukrainian Village into a five-story retail and apartment development. The building would include 40 units and ground floor retail.This $33 million project would bring a 60-unit affordable housing redevelopment with a ground-floor grocery store to West Humboldt Park.The two local real estate development firms plan to create the Halim A. Flowers Center, which will include transitional housing for the formerly incarcerated, rental apartments and single-family homes. The $28 million project is expected to break ground this fall.This $11 million project planned to convert a 92-year old church in Logan Square into 22 affordable apartments has received $2 million in federal funds and still needs about $7 million more, though it was approved by the Chicago City Council in December 2020.One of Chicago’s oldest nonprofits is planning to step into the affordable housing market with a nine-story structure in the Illinois Medical District. The building, called Foglia Residences, will include 76 apartments reserved for residents making below the area median income, with an emphasis on housing blind and visually impaired residents.A proposed $38 million mixed-income complex in Bronzeville would include 71 units across a complex of eight buildings.The city purchased the largest vacant lot in rapidly gentrifying Pilsen as part of Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s initiatives to revitalize the city’s South and West sides. The plan is to turn the six-acre former industrial site into 280 units of affordable housing, green space and retail spots.In another effort to stave off gentrification in Humboldt Park, this development will offer 64 units of affordable housing and 2,500 square feet of commercial space on a long-vacant lot.The 30-acre development is set to include a new hospital, vocational school, day care, market, affordable housing, restaurants, retail, sports fields, a theater and more.Dubbed 43 Green, this $100 million project will include 99 residential units – 50 of which will be marketed as affordable housing – and more than 5,000 feet of retail space.Two local nonprofits plan to develop the long-vacant Halsted Indoor Mall into a mixed-use complex that will include 250 rental units, 140 single-family homes and up to 20,000 square feet of ground retail space.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",170 North Green Street,Between a new casino," and a push for affordable housing, there’s plenty of interest in developing Chicago.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/07/19/here-are-chicagos-most-notable-development-projects-of-2022/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Between a new casino</a> and a push for affordable housing, there’s plenty of interest in developing Chicago.","170 North Green Street Chicago, IL","170 N Green St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8850831, -87.6490542, 0.0)",41.8850831,-87.6490542,0.0,2022

It sold the adjacent lot in 2014 for $42 million, and now is poised to sell the two-tower building for $255 million to Morningstar founder Joe Mansueto.The firm primarily invests in private companies for wealthy family business founders, and in recent years has hired away Joe Gutman from GCM Grosvenor and John Dills from GTCR.For Sterling Bay, the Lincoln Yards project is one of several several blockbuster deals. In the past year, it acquired 600 West Chicago Avenue, home of Groupon’s headquarters, for $510 million; and the Prudential Plaza for $680 million.The developer also has been a key investor in the Fulton Market building boom, developing the Google Midwest headquarters at 1000 West Fulton Market, the Fulton West development at 1330 West Fulton Market, the “vendor village” office building at 210 North Carpenter Street near the McDonald’s building and two hotels. It also recently secured a $182 million construction loan for the start of its ambitious plans for the 300 block of North Green Street.

Other tenants include DLA Piper, Mead Johnson Nutrition and Morton Salt.A Hines spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the refinancing, which was provided by AIG, MetLife and a subsidiary of TIAA, according to Cook County records.Hines bought the vacant riverfront property in 2012 for $25.4 million, and the building cost some $500 million to complete, the Chicago Tribune reported in 2016. Montreal-based Ivanhoe Cambridge kicked in $300 million toward the project, with the city pledging $29 million in tax-increment financing money for the development of a 1.5-acre public park on the site.The developers first proposed the project in 2009, but shelved it during the recession when they couldn’t secure financing.Together with Riverside Investment & Development’s office tower across Lake Street at 150 North Riverside Plaza, River Point helped launch a transformation of the area where the branches of the river meet.Hines is building on that across the river at Wolf Point, where it is erecting three soaring towers in a mixed-use project with the Kennedy family.Just south, Riverside and Howard Hughes Corporation are building a 54-story office tower at 110 North Wacker Drive, the former site of GGP’s headquarters.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",444 West Lake Street,Hines has secured a, $425 million refinancing on the River Point office tower at the confluence of the three branches of the Chicago River.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/11/14/hines-lands-425m-refinancing-on-river-point-office-tower/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Hines has secured a</a> $425 million refinancing on the River Point office tower at the confluence of the three branches of the Chicago River.","444 West Lake Street Chicago, IL","444 W Lake St, Chicago, IL 60606, USA","(41.8862429, -87.6395364, 0.0)",41.8862429,-87.6395364,0.0,2018

The building’s chief architect is Jeanne Gang, head of Studio Gang Architects.Several other major sales should be coming to the tower soon, but none as high-priced as this sale. The tower’s agents have 11 units labeled as “pending” on public listing sites, including two units over $10 million. In late February, a unit on the 80th-floor went for nearly $8.85 million, a record in the building at the time. A three bedroom, three-bathroom unit was sold for $2.9 million just days after the $8.9 million sale.Prior to this deal, the highest priced sale in the city was an 89th-floor penthouse at Chicago’s Trump International & Tower, sold for $20 million in the city’s second-priciest condo deal ever.The Trump Tower condo was owned by Sanjay Shay, CEO of Hoffman Estates-based software maker Vistex. It sold March 7 after going under contract in mid-February. Shay bought the 14,260-square-foot full-floor penthouse for $17 million in 2014 and listed the unit for $30 million in September.The buyer’s purchase price is the second-highest that anyone has paid for a single Chicago-area property. Citadel Chief Executive Officer Ken Griffin bought four condo units for more than $58 million in the building at 9 West Walton Street in Gold Coast in 2017, in four separate transactions. Only one of his transactions was priced for more than $20 million.The Trump Tower deal is also the latest example of high-end properties in the Chicago area moving at a record pace, despite rising interest rates thwarting buyers in other segments of the market. With at least 49 sales for $5 million or more this year, the count of deals at that price level already exceeds last year’s historic high with three months still to go in 2022.Contact Miranda Davis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n St. Regis penthouse sold for $8M in December seeks $9.3M \n Another St. Regis sale breaks $4 million \n St. Regis condo sells for almost $9MAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",363 East Wacker Drive,A sky-high condo at," the St. Regis sold for a sky-high $20.6 million, making it the highest priced in Chicago this year.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/09/22/st-regis-condo-fetches-20-6m-in-chicagos-priciest-sale-this-year/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A sky-high condo at</a> the St. Regis sold for a sky-high $20.6 million, making it the highest priced in Chicago this year.","363 East Wacker Drive Chicago, IL","363 E Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL 60601, USA","(41.8874508, -87.61745979999999, 0.0)",41.8874508,-87.61745979999999,0.0,2022

After the city approved the plan in 2016, workers razed a decades-old bank building on the site and dug a foundation, but the project stalled when the property owner struggled to find tenants.Since summer 2016, the site has remained a block-sized crater hemmed by chain-link fences.While looking forward to the project, area property owners and renters are wary of another fake-out, according to Tim Ryan, president and managing broker of Monarch Realty Corp., who bears no relation to Ryan Companies.“We’re all kind of waiting to see whether it can be can be done,” said Ryan, who lives in Portage Park and sits on the Six Corners Association’s economic vitality committee.“We always want to know is whether they have the financing in place to begin at least the first couple phases of the project, and whether they have a clear path going forward. No one wants to see a developer walk away from a half-built shell because the winds of the economy have changed.”Once one of Chicago’s busiest retail districts, the Six Corners area suffered a steep decline starting in the 1970s, and this month’s closure of the city’s last Sears outlet at 4720 West Irving Park throws the neighborhood even deeper into flux.But the district’s retail strength has also resurged post-recession, as an influx of young professionals has sent new demand cascading up the city’s northwest side Blue Line corridor.Since 2014, 45 new businesses have opened inside the district’s officially-marked boundaries, according to Kelli Wefenstette, director of the Six Corners Association. And Ryan said retail vacancies within a mile radius of the intersection have roughly halved since 2015.That trend can only accelerate if the Point is seen through to completion, Ryan said.Six Corners “is so far west that it’s been off the map for a while, but we’re seeing a lot of commercial opportunities now that are supported by this growing residential base,” Ryan said. “And if you have elderly people moving in, then their families are going to visit, and inevitably, they’re going to be spending their money somewhere.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","15 a.m., June 21: Clark Street","UPDATE, 11:15 a.m.,"," June 21: Clark Street Real Estate and Ryan Companies are set to unveil a 10-story mixed-use senior housing complex in Portage Park’s Six Corners Shopping District, fulfilling a years-old pledge to fill a four-acre hole at the center of one of the city’s fastest-growing commercial cross-points.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/06/13/clark-street-ryan-to-unveil-second-shot-at-the-point-in-portage-park/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">UPDATE, 11:15 a.m.,</a> June 21: Clark Street Real Estate and Ryan Companies are set to unveil a 10-story mixed-use senior housing complex in Portage Park’s Six Corners Shopping District, fulfilling a years-old pledge to fill a four-acre hole at the center of one of the city’s fastest-growing commercial cross-points.","15 a.m., June 21: Clark Street Chicago, IL","21 N Clark St, Chicago, IL 60603, USA","(41.8817808, -87.6306484, 0.0)",41.8817808,-87.6306484,0.0,2018

Both firms focus on affordable housing.Portland, Maine-based Silver Street acquired the complex in 2003, according to the company’s website. The property includes 320 units across 32 buildings at 31 Olympic Drive. It was Silver Street’s only property in the Chicago area.Though public records show the purchase was finalized earlier this month, its financing has been in the works for longer. The City of Chicago Heights signed off on the issuance of revenue bonds to provide up to $25 million to finance an acquisition and improvements to the property in 2019.An attorney for National Preservation Housing Partners told the City Council at the time that the organization planned to purchase the apartment complex with a $28 million loan from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as well as a $22 million tax-exempt bond issue, minutes from the council’s January 2019 meeting show.The Olympic Village purchase rounds out National Preservation Housing Partners’ portfolio in the Chicago area to 700 units. The company also owns properties elsewhere in Illinois as well as in Arizona, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland and Pennsylvania and has preserved approximately 4,000 units in total.The company sold off four properties totaling 755 units in the Chicago area in fall 2018, including Maple Point Apartments in Gold Coast for $53 million, Centennial Apartments in suburban Mount Prospect for $30.2 million and Walsh Park Apartments in Bucktown for $35.3 million. All three of those properties were sold to affordable housing landlord Standard Companies, which recently paid about $43 million for a South Side apartment complex from the Chicago Housing Authority.Another affordable housing provider, New York’s Jonathan Rose Cos., recently poured $63 million into the acquisition and redevelopment of an affordable housing complex on Chicago’s Near West Side, Barbara Jean Wright Court.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",32 buildings at 31 Olympic Drive,Andrew Delman’s, National Preservation Housing Partners picked up a Section 8 affordable housing complex in Cook County for $20.7 million this month.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/09/27/section-8-complex-goes-for-20-7m-in-south-suburb/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Andrew Delman’s</a> National Preservation Housing Partners picked up a Section 8 affordable housing complex in Cook County for $20.7 million this month.","32 buildings at 31 Olympic Drive Chicago, IL","Olympic Dr, Bridgeview, IL 60455, USA","(41.7304326, -87.7962098, 0.0)",41.7304326,-87.7962098,0.0,2022

That average is the highest of three condo developments now in development, which include the St. Regis and Tribune Tower.One Chicago is across the street from a McDonald’s where the violence erupted last month. JDL says it isn’t worried about the potential fallout.“It was isolated to their location and didn’t impact our building,” said JDL Principal Jim Letchinger. “We’re obviously disappointed, and we’ve been diligent [in working with the Chicago Police Department.] It’s on every street. It’s a city issue. It’s an every-city issue.”St. Regis is averaging about $1,034 a square foot, according to Crain’s. While there’s less recent data on prices at Tribune Tower, an agent for the tower previously said prices were averaging $1,050 a square foot.\nBuyers who are receiving their units now have probably had them under contract for months, long before the shooting across the street, although they could still cancel. Four closed on May 31 and another 17 are marked as pending sales on real estate sites.The most expensive units, a $28 million two-story penthouse and several $10 million ones that cover a full floor of the building, don’t have buyers.One Chicago has 77 condos on the top 30 floors of the 75-story building. The rest of the development is dedicated to 735 apartments and retail space that includes a Whole Foods, a Lifetime Fitness and a Philz Coffee.

It exceeded the $3.95 million sale in 2013 for the former home of the founder of the Adler Planetarium.The Woodlawn Avenue mansion was listed in March 2020 at $4.75 million. The buyers are Edip Pektas, a venture capital executive, and his wife Dina Rehab who plan on using the property as their second home. The couple lives in Inverness, a northwest suburb, 40 miles from Hyde Park.Sellers Linda and Brian Hanessian told Crain’s at the time of the listing that the house was extensively restored after they bought the property 20 years ago. The home has a broad stone fireplace flanked by wood bookcases, leaded glass windows and a wood bench built into the base of the windows.The sale of the Woodlawn Avenue house brings the tally of homes sold for $4 million or more to 101 over the past 12 months, doubling the average in the previous six years of 52 sales. Previously, the most $4 million-plus homes sold in a single year was 73 in 2018. Among the top 10 residential sales last year, eight were condos in the city.A six-bedroom, 8,800-square-foot condo unit at 840 North Lake Shore Drive sold for $11.25 million in July was the priciest transaction, which eclipsed the previous year’s $9.5 million sale of a five-bedroom Winnetka lakefront mansion.Of last year’s transactions, 70 came from the city’s North Side. Real estate agents attributed the boom to a bullish stock market and low mortgage rates. The minimum sale price of the 50 top home sales in 2021 was $4.95 million, up from $4 million since 2015, according to Crain’s.[Crain’s] – Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",5659 S Woodlawn Ave,A Hyde Park mansion," sold for $4.2 million at the end of December, a record-price for a Chicago home south of Roosevelt Road.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/01/06/hyde-park-mansion-sold-for-4-2m-in-december-record-price-for-chicago-homes-south-of-roosevelt-road/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A Hyde Park mansion</a> sold for $4.2 million at the end of December, a record-price for a Chicago home south of Roosevelt Road.","5659 S Woodlawn Ave Chicago, IL","5659 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637, USA","(41.79165649999999, -87.59608039999999, 0.0)",41.79165649999999,-87.59608039999999,0.0,2022

Or so must have thought the buyer of a $4.75 million fortress in Naperville.The mansion at 28 W. 660 Perkins Court, which spans nearly 18,000 square feet and sits on three acres, traded at a price that represents the biggest resi deal in Naperville since 2008, according to Crain’s.In fact, only one deal in the Chicago suburbs this year tops it — an $8.75 million sale for Le Grand Reve in Winnetka.The sellers of the Naperville deal, Tim and Sara Reifstock, bought the site for $755,000 in 2008 and embarked on a massive project that culminated in a Tudor-style mansion featuring six bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, a nine-car garage, elevator and a movie theater. It’s unclear how much they paid to build the home, which was marketed by Michael La Fido of @properties.Similarly, it’s not clear who bought the home, though the buyer did receive a healthy discount.

The latest version was approved on June 21.No mortgage appears to have been issued on the property since the Sept. 17 sale, according to Cook County property records.The site barely falls inside the Near North Affordable Requirements Ordinance pilot zone established by the City Council in November, meaning any new plan would trigger a mandate for the developer to make at least 20 percent of its units affordable.The application approved in June calls for 10 affordable units — the minimum number required under the city’s 2015 Affordable Requirements Ordinance — to be included on-site.The city’s buildings department has not issued permits for the property, according to city records.The new tower would rise across the street from the 496-unit K2 apartment complex, which was completed in 2013 by Fifield Companies and is now managed by Lincoln Property Company.Vancouver-based Onni Group also wants to build a 356-unit residential tower at 353 West Grand Avenue in River North. Alderman Brendan Reilly (42nd) appeared to endorse the proposal in his newsletter last week, adding it’s set to go before the plan commission next month.Onni has also signaled interest in buying a 190,000-square-foot property at 901 North Halsted Street, at the southern tip of Goose Island.A spokesman for Onni did not respond to multiple requests for comment Wednesday.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",352 North Union Avenue,The Onni Group paid," $17.5 million to acquire a West Loop property from Cardiff Mason Development, three months after the city approved plans for a 373-unit apartment building to rise on the site.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/09/26/onni-group-buys-site-of-373-planned-apartments-in-west-loop/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Onni Group paid</a> $17.5 million to acquire a West Loop property from Cardiff Mason Development, three months after the city approved plans for a 373-unit apartment building to rise on the site.","352 North Union Avenue Chicago, IL","352 N Union Ave, Chicago, IL 60661, USA","(41.8882605, -87.6462782, 0.0)",41.8882605,-87.6462782,0.0,2018

The seller was a venture led by developer Paul Gearen.The now-vacant six-story building had until recently been fully occupied by financial services company Northern Trust. It vacated the space at the end of its lease to consolidate operations into a new location at 333 South Wabash Avenue.To redevelop the 2.5 million-square-foot Old Post Office, 601W spent $800 million and inked big leases with tenants like Uber, Walgreens and Ferrara Candy.But now is a difficult time for the office market. Across the U.S., office vacancy has been rising, and Chicago is no exception. But Matt Whipple of Telos Group, which is marketing 801 South Canal, said 601W is betting that a property redesigned for the post-pandemic world will attract tenants, Crain’s reported. The new building will be named Canal Station.601W is also renovating an office tower at 1 South Wacker Drive as well as the Aon Center, where the firm is spending $185 million in upgrades.In New York, 601W has reportedly struck a deal with SL Green Realty to purchase the Amazon-anchored property at 410 10th Avenue for $952.5 million.

Michelin-starred “Top Chef” victor Michael Voltaggio and his brother Bryan, who has also been a contestant on the cooking show, will be the culinary heads of the restaurant, called Fioretta, or “little flower” in Italian.The restaurant group’s commitment to the property, which was co-developed by Chicago’s Mark Goodman & Associates, adds another tenant to an already strong tenant roster.The building filled out amid a pandemic that depleted office demand elsewhere in Chicago and in downtowns across the nation, hitting 87 percent leased after venture capital firm Valor Equity Partners this month said it would take 24,000 square feet, exiting the former John Hancock Center on the Mag Mile. Other firms that signed on during the health crisis include Hazel Technologies across 50,000 square feet as well as real estate tech company VTS, which leased 36,000.Fulton Market was the only area in Chicago to experience positive office space absorption in 2021. Tishman and Goodman just scored a $26.1 million loan on the property from Wells Fargo, a sign of its strong performance and ability to carry more debt after obtaining an $81.4 million construction loan in 2019.The restaurant will be the Voltaggios’ first in Chicago. Its will add to high-end steakhouse options in the West Loop, including the nearby Swift & Sons at 1000 West Fulton Market Street.

01:52 PM","Every Chicago developer, big or small, wants a piece of Fulton Market, the once gritty area where Class A office buildings, boutique hotels and new apartment projects have defied the pandemic that battered commercial real estate.","[""Fulton St. Companies’ Alex Najem (iStock)Every Chicago developer, big or small, wants a piece of Fulton Market, the once gritty area where Class A office buildings, boutique hotels and new apartment projects have defied the pandemic that battered commercial real estate.Fulton Street Companies – the largest smaller developer in the neighborhood, as CEO Alex Najem calls it – has nine projects that are either completed, under construction or proposed in Fulton Market. That’s nowhere close to the scale of the bigger developers Najem is up against, including Sterling Bay, whose dozen or so Fulton Market projects total more than 4.4 million square feet and Shapack Partners, developer of 10 planned projects and two hotels totalling at least 2.5 million square feet in the district.For Najem, the key is focus – not just Fulton Market, but in its most sought-after locations. After all, it’s right there in his company’s name.“Are you really in Fulton Market, if you’re not on Fulton Market (street)?” asked Matt Pistorio, founder of Chicago commercial real estate agency Madison Rose, which manages FSC’s leasing at 1045 West Fulton Market. “It’s a running joke we have, but, if you’re located at Fulton Market (street), that’s a premier address like Wacker Drive.”Unlike other Chicago developers that spread their bets across the city, Najem narrowed his focus. His strategy has been a success so far, even though he jumped into the Fulton Market race in 2017, years after the pioneers such as Sterling Bay and Shapack Partners.About 12 years ago, Najem was representing tenants looking for restaurants and retail spaces as a broker for the development firm Cedar Street. He got his first taste of Fulton Market in 2014 when he led Cedar to buy and later sell four loft buildings. Eight years later, Najem’s company bought those same buildings for $33 million. Of the nine planned sites and completed projects on his firm’s website, seven have Fulton Market addresses.“I had to build my own reputation and the only way to really win for me was to have the best locations, the best architecture, and the most flexibility,” Najem said in an interview. “If I could build the same product as somebody else but I had a better location I would always win the tenant.”Born in Texas, Najem grew up mostly in Indianapolis, frequently visiting Chicago. He started his career as a trader at the Chicago Board of Trade in 2006 and pivoted to real estate four years later.Najem’s love for restaurants and experience in helping his uncle in the hospitality business prepared him to understand what tenants want and build his network.In December 2017, he partnered with longtime friend Ross Babel, a residential developer focused on ground-up development across Chicago. While their business started from buying a three-story fire station on 114 North Aberdeen and leasing it out to two tenants, FSC had plans for bigger ground-up projects based on Babel’s expertise in getting project permits and Najem’s ability to raise money and buy properties.The redevelopment of a dilapidated 15,000-square-foot meatpacking facility at 1100 West Fulton Market put FSC on the map. It created a 45,000-square-foot, three- and five-story showroom, retail, and office space, with large loft-style windows on the ground level, metal awnings, and a rooftop terrace for furniture brand Herman Miller, the single tenant.1100 West Fulton (FultonSt.com)While companies tried to find buildings with large floor plates before the pandemic to fit employees into a single floor, Najem “saw the expectation that people would rather control everything in the building, the aesthetics, the roof deck, and the way people entered and exited the building,” said Jim Plunkard, partner and co-founder of Chicago architecture firm Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture that worked with FSC on the 1100 West Fulton Market project.“It gave him a lot of feedback to stay in this district and to grow in this district,” said Plunkard recalling when FSC signed Herman Miller for a 15-year lease. “Najem was ahead of the trend.”As commercial property sales plummet and firms adapt to remote work, Najem’s strategy created a windfall. The building generated “an exceptional amount of interest and bidding activity” and sold at a record $925 per square foot in December, said Cody Hundertmark, at Cushman & Wakefield, who represented FSC in the $41.75 million sale to Australian Zagame Corporation.Over the past two years, he bought about four acres in Fulton Market and completed a 160,000-square-foot Class A building at 1045 West Fulton Market that’s ready for tenant move-in.“Right when the pandemic hit, they [Fulton Street Companies] decided to launch a project at 1045 West Fulton Market,” said Madison Rose’s Pistorio, who is in charge of leasing at the building. “In a way Alex was kind of gambling, even when the pandemic started, because he knew it was going to take off.”By now, there is “enough interest to lease the entire building,” Najem said of the 1045 West Fulton Market property. “The amount of interest over the last month has been more than I’ve ever experienced in my time in Fulton Market.”1045 West Fulton (FultonSt.com)While FSC’s successful redevelopment helped create a buzz in the neighborhood, Sterling Bay and Shapack Partners are catching up.Sterling Bay has at least eight residential and commercial projects totaling about 3 million square feet either under construction, approved, or proposed in the district, according to local commercial developer SVN Chicago. At a price tag of more than $105 million, Sterling Bay also plans to buy a vacant 2.7-acre site running along the west side of Peoria Street and Metra tracks, the largest remaining development site in the Fulton Market District.Shapack Partners is aiming to build a 28-story residential building at 1353 West Fulton Street and a commercial building at 170 North Green Street with 275 apartments, office space, and 150 hotel rooms. It’s also seeking approval from the City Council to demolish the longtime Bridgford Foods processing plant across the street from 167 North Green Street and develop a 40-story mixed-use project.Najem says the firms’ aggressive expansion will help keep the neighborhood densely populated. He saw the lifting of the ban on residential development in Fulton Market in 2020 as another chance to make the district that much more sought-after.Fulton Market Street is the “real walkable street that’ll draw retail, restaurants after the pandemic,” said HPA’s Plunakard. Adding new residential projects to the scene, Plunkard said the area is going to feed on itself when more retailers want to come in – more good news for FSC.“It’s the best of both worlds because the ban on residential north of Lake Street forced a lot of commercial development,” Najem said. FSC wants to build 1.1 million square feet of residential and office buildings around the 1200 block of West Fulton Street and a 430-unit apartment building on 1325 Randolph Street.Projects lined up to break ground potentially in May are a 39,000-square-foot, 433-unit project at 1201 West Fulton Market and a 530,000-square-foot Class A office and retail building at 917 West Fulton Market. Najem’s first luxury condo development, where he plans to move in upon completion, at the 10-story, 25-unit condominium at 1010 West Madison, will also break ground this year.1201 West Fulton (FultonSt.com)Najem still sees opportunities to buy properties and expand his portfolio, with his latest purchase being four loft buildings on 1144 West Fulton, 112 North May, 1101 West Fulton, and 220 North Aberdeen for more than $30 million.“I walk there every single day, I see every single project,” said Najem. “I don’t focus on any other parts of the city or anywhere else in the country. I solely focus on Fulton Market and that’s it.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","105 million, St",Every Chicago," developer, big or small, wants a piece of Fulton Market, the once gritty area where Class A office buildings, boutique hotels and new apartment projects have defied the pandemic that battered commercial real estate.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/03/23/how-fulton-street-companies-longtime-bet-on-prime-locations-is-paying-off/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Every Chicago</a> developer, big or small, wants a piece of Fulton Market, the once gritty area where Class A office buildings, boutique hotels and new apartment projects have defied the pandemic that battered commercial real estate.","105 million, St Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2022

Farther north, Sterling Bay is transforming a large swath of riverfront property into the Lincoln Yards mega-development, while just to the southeast Tribune Media is planning its own major project called the “River District.”And in the shadow of the new Lyft site, developers including Onni Group are eyeing potential new uses for the heavily industrial Goose Island.

Other tenants in those buildings have included companies with e-commerce origins, like Warby Parker and Bonobos.Acadia’s footprint equates to about 16 percent of the total 141,000 square feet of retail space on Armitage’s shopping strip, making it the largest retail landlord on one of the North Side’s prime shopping corridors, according to Stone Real Estate’s annual report.Acadia owns properties in other areas of Chicago and in many large cities across the U.S. Last month, the company sold another Lincoln Park building containing Lululemon’s new “experiential” flagship store for $32 million to New York-based Feil Organization.

The report described the buyers as a high net-worth family office based in Pittsburgh.If completed, the deal would be the highest price paid for a downtown office building since early 2018.Sterling Bay and JPMorgan acquired the site in 2014 as part of a $30.5 million purchase of Oprah Winfrey’s four-building Harpo Studios campus. The new office building was then developed.The duo listed it in the winter for a report $450 million. The fast-food behemoth moved its headquarters from Oak Brook to the nine-story building in June 2018. Its long-term lease of 490,000 square feet runs through July 2033.Despite the pending sale, Chicago’s office market continues to struggle as companies scale back on office space or exit existing leases amid a work-from-home world.

The lender was KKR Real Estate Finance Trust, records indicate.The refinancing comes after CIM renovated the nearly 1-million-square-foot Financial District building. Renovations included improvements to the building’s public plaza, new lounge areas and a new lobby that was relocated from LaSalle Street to Financial Street, hence the rebranding to 425 South Financial Place. Renovations were completed in 2018, CIM said in a press release. Interior renovations were completed by its previous owner in 2015.CIM bought the building in 2016 for $189 milion and financed the deal with a $131 million loan from JP Morgan Chase. Last summer, CIM inked Chicago Trading to a 27,000-square-foot lease expansion in the tower.Built in 1984, 425 South Financial Place includes a 950,000-square-foot office tower and an 83,000-square-foot annex and a 45,000-square-foot outdoor plaza.CIM is involved in a number of high-profile development projects in Chicago.

Bansal at 1887 Cooper Lane, which is advertised on Airbnb as a “beautiful mansion near O’Hare and Chicago” that can accommodate 15 guests. It rents for $690 to $773 a night.Bansal began offering short-term rentals at the home after moving out of state, and neighbors say it’s frequently the site of big parties.Cooper said a teenager’s birthday party last year drew 300 people and had to be shut down by police. Sometimes, he added, “when the wind comes from the west, one can smell the dope being smoked.”While the Highland Park City Council last year declined to prohibit short-term rentals, it imposed a rule in the Cooper Lane neighborhood requiring all leases to be a minimum of a year.But neighbors said the home continued to be used as a short-term rental.Bansal and his daughter Rania, who is listed as the host on Airbnb, declined comment to the Highland Park News, as did their attorney. But guests of the home continue to post positive reviews about it online — even as recently as last month.Residents of another upscale neighborhood — Chicago’s Gold Coast — faced a similar dilemma with two houses, but pressure from the neighbors and two aldermen led the owners to list the properties for sale.Chicago requires all short-term-rental hosts to register with the city, and allows neighborhoods to ban them via petition.

In the listing for the building, Colliers said that the property is an “excellent candidate” for conversion into condominiums, senior housing or a hotel.

CBRE, which was the broker at that time, valued the building at around $15 million. The land it stands on, meanwhile, was estimated to be worth more than the building, due to its prime location.The property housed one of Chicago’s oldest private clubs before closing in May of last year. The club, which was founded in 1869 by the city’s Jewish community, faced declining membership and mounting debt and had previously said it hopes to continue in a new location.According to a previous report from Crain’s, the building is in bad shape and the club can’t afford to pay for a renovation.The Standard Club declined to provide any information on the listing.

The couple bought the home on Lansdowne Lane for $2.75 million, less than half of what they are planning to sell it for.Nagy, named head coach of the Bears in January 2018, was fired in January following a dismal record of 34 wins and 31 losses in four seasons. He will be returning to the Kansas City Chiefs as quarterbacks coach.The home, built in 2017, features a home gym, outdoor fire pit, and a Bears-themed basketball court painted orange and blue with a Bears logo on the padding under the hoop. When the house was for sale in 2018, a listing from Premier Realty Group said the house had Amish-built cabinetry, a media room, a bar in the basement, and a rear patio facing Lake Michigan, according to the publication.Co-host of the Bear Down podcast Brendan Sugrue wrote about a “coming soon” listing from Compass for Nagy’s mansion on Twitter on March 5, but was taken down from the brokerage’s website with a “temporarily off market” label the next day. The listing remains actively listed in the private network.Lake Bluff is also home to Chicago Bears quarterback Andy Dalton, who signed a one-year $10 million contract with the team last year. Dalton and his wife, Jordan, bought a five-bedroom, 5,300-square-foot home for $2.48 million in an off-market deal after it initially was listed for $2.595 million.Chicago’s luxury residential market had a record year in 2021, with more than 100 homes sold for $4 million or more, double the average of 51.5 over the past six years. Real estate agents attributed the strong market to gains in the stock market and buyers’ demand for more room to work or attend school from or even private beaches that allow physical distancing.[Crain’s] – Connie KimUpdates: to show that house is on the market, according to the Chicago Tribune.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",570 Lansdowne Lane,"UPDATED March 7,"," 2022, 2:10 p.m.: A Lake Bluff mansion owned by the former head coach of the Chicago Bears Matt Nagy is on the market for $6.19 million.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/03/07/former-bears-coach-matt-nagys-lake-bluff-mansion-to-hit-the-market-for-6m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">UPDATED March 7,</a> 2022, 2:10 p.m.: A Lake Bluff mansion owned by the former head coach of the Chicago Bears Matt Nagy is on the market for $6.19 million.","570 Lansdowne Lane Chicago, IL","570 Lansdowne Ln, Lake Bluff, IL 60044, USA","(42.27098000000001, -87.8313934, 0.0)",42.27098000000001,-87.8313934,0.0,2022

Homes in East Garfield Park that sold in the first three months of 2022 sat on the market for an average of 141 days.Inside the property (Zillow)Franklin bought the vine-covered house for $48,000 in 2011 as a personal project after deciding that “all the original detail was salvageable,” Franklin said.Some details, like lacy wood trim in doorways, survived the years but took a long time to restore. “It had a lot of paint on it, but nobody had ever bashed it up,” he said. Restoring the wood inside the home took Franklin four years.Inside the property (Zillow)Franklin restored most of the home himself, with help from friends and co-workers. Restoration included cleaning and repairing the exterior stone and installing new utilities and a new roof. Franklin also added a new kitchen and four bathrooms.While the median sale price for homes in East Garfield Park was $302,500 last year, Franklin said his $750,000 asking price reflected the extensive rehab and the size of the lot.Inside the property (Zillow)According to research done by Franklin and his friends, the home was designed and built around 1896 by a firm called Crowen & Richards. The same firm also built many other greystones and apartment buildings in East Garfield Park, Woodlawn, Washington Park and Uptown.

Its first condo residents did not move in until summer 2017, according to Crain’s.The 3-acre site at 540 West Webster Avenue had been home to the 125-year-old Lincoln Park Hospital until the facility closed in 2008. Sandz, led by co-founder Richard Zisook, bought the property a year later and demolished the building, proposing 95 condos and 75 apartments in its place.Sandz also built the condo high-rises at 530 and 600 North Lake Shore Drive in Streeterville, plus the Dickens Court Townhomes and Eugenie Terrace Townhomes in Lincoln Park, according to its website.Solomon Cordwell Buenz designed a number of high-profile projects locally, and is the architect for CIM and Golub & Company’s condo redevelopment of the Tribune Tower, as well as CA Ventures’ nearly-completed South Loop apartment tower at 1140 South Wabash Avenue.A spokesperson for the architecture firm declined to comment on the suit Wednesday.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",540 West Webster Avenue,The developer of a," year-old residential building in Lincoln Park has sued the architecture firm Solomon Cordwell Buenz, alleging shoddy design work cost the builder nearly $2.5 million to fix.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/10/24/sandz-development-sues-scb-over-design-of-lincoln-park-condos/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The developer of a</a> year-old residential building in Lincoln Park has sued the architecture firm Solomon Cordwell Buenz, alleging shoddy design work cost the builder nearly $2.5 million to fix.","540 West Webster Avenue Chicago, IL","540 W Webster Ave, Chicago, IL 60614, USA","(41.9220507, -87.6430384, 0.0)",41.9220507,-87.6430384,0.0,2018

Peacock vice chairman Steven Holtzman in a statement. “Open space, eclectic restaurant offerings and ample free parking combine to provide the perfect backdrop for our new location, which will redefine the way consumers shop for luxury.”The retailer, which specializes in luxury jewelry and watches from brands such as Cartier, Rolex and Mikimoto, operates two other locations, at the Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg and the Old Orchard Mall in Skokie.As C.D. Peacock leans into the suburban retail market, other parts of Chicago’s shopping scene are experiencing a revival as well, as Covid cases continue to fall from a winter peak.Retailers are heading into Bucktown and Wicker Park, in part because of elevated rents in the trendier West Loop neighborhood, and commercial property investors have taken notice of a drop in vacancies.“The investment sales market is as hot as I’ve ever seen it,” Marcus & Millichap’s vice president of investments, Mitchell Kiven, told The Real Deal this week. “It’s incredibly active right now, everything is getting multiple offers.”Net rents in those neighborhoods top out at $70 per square foot, as opposed to closer to $100 in the West Loop, according to Chris Irwin, vice president of retail sales at Collier’s. Landlords are also offering more flexible lease teams instead of requiring five-year minimums.In suburban Oak Brook, retail rents are also expected to fetch $70 to $75 per square foot a year, exclusive of property taxes, Paul Bryant, an agent with Chicago-based Mid-America Real Estate, told TRD on Friday.Mid-America has a multi-tenant retail building set for construction just east of Oakbrook Center, and Bryant said he expects to fetch those rates.“In this situation, I think we’ll get it.

About 100 people turned up for a one-hour open house at a new 11-unit condo building in Lakeview, John Grafft of Compass told the outlet. Another Coldwell agent, Anthony Rodriguez, took a client to an Albany Park house on the market for just two days, only to find a full schedule of back-to-back showings.“It’s crazy out there,” Dubray told Crain’s. The third open house “is probably only a day behind” the other two.As the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates again, making mortgages more expensive, many buyers are shopping for homes even before sellers are ready. About 4,100 homes came on the market in Chicago in the first week of 2022, just shy of the 5,350 available in 2021’s first week.A survey by Compass shows that after steep declines in the inventory of homes available in 2020 and 2021, 44 percent of agents expect supply to improve. Yet many say 2022 will still favor sellers over buyers.“You have to pounce when a good new listing comes on the market,” Brian Pistorius of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices told Crain’s. About 37 families came to his weekend open houses in Logan Square, he said. “In this weather, we’d usually be lucky to get five or six.”[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1249 S Christiana Ave,Chicago’s frenetic, housing market shows few signs of slowing as buyers jostled to be first in line after a hyperactive 2021.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/01/11/chicagos-frenetic-housing-market-shows-few-signs-of-slowing-as-2022-starts/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Chicago’s frenetic</a> housing market shows few signs of slowing as buyers jostled to be first in line after a hyperactive 2021.","1249 S Christiana Ave Chicago, IL","1249 S Christiana Ave, Chicago, IL 60623, USA","(41.8648666, -87.7090183, 0.0)",41.8648666,-87.7090183,0.0,2022

The developer has had recent success with several projects, most notably ultra-luxury condo tower No. 9 Walton.The bible college put its land up for sale last summer, and the offering drew a high volume of interest because of its proximity to Downtown. At the time, The Real Deal reported that a buyer could eventually build up to 5.3 million square feet of new apartments, office, retail or hotels by transferring unused zoning density from the school’s remaining buildings.If the deal moves forward and JDL wins approvals from the city, it could build 2,500 or more apartments and condos throughout several buildings on the site.Down the street from the Moody’s campus, JDL is building One Chicago Square, which will feature 795 luxury apartments, 75 condos and 50,000 square feet of office space between two buildings. The developer bought the site from the Archdiocese of Chicago for about $115 million in 2017.JDL made a splash with No. 9 Walton, in which it has amassed $377 million in sales, according to a recent Tribune analysis.

That clears the way for Compasspoint Development to build higher than would have been previously allowed.The Barrington, Illinois-based developer plans to build a seven-story building with 131 apartments, a restaurant and lounge, a rooftop swimming pool and parking for 179 vehicles.Residents who spoke out against the project said it would cause traffic problems, ruin the neighborhood aesthetics and be unsafe. One even said that a potential derailment from nearby railroad tracks could lead to a train car crashing into the building.Only one of the residents in attendance at the council meeting spoke in favor of the development. Others said that aldermen who support the project could be voted out of office.“If you make a mistake tonight, some of you will live to regret (it),” NIMBY resident Oswald Nelson said at the meeting.At the same meeting, council members held a second vote that tentatively approved selling the city-owned lot to Compasspoint for the project. The property’s rezoning won’t be official until the purchase is complete.Officials had previously said the building would be offered for $300,000. The exact price CompassPoint will pay hasn’t been disclosed.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1300 block of Webford Avenue,After a months-long," debate, a Chicago suburb agreed to rezone a property to make way for a seven-story apartment building.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/02/des-plaines-approves-rezoning-for-controversial-apartment-building/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">After a months-long</a> debate, a Chicago suburb agreed to rezone a property to make way for a seven-story apartment building.","1300 block of Webford Avenue Chicago, IL","1300 Webford Ave, Des Plaines, IL 60016, USA","(42.0420896, -87.89200319999999, 0.0)",42.0420896,-87.89200319999999,0.0,2022

Adams St. is part of a CMBS loan, and the special servicing move may also be an indication the mortgage terms need to be restructured to avoid default.According to the report, the hotel owner — a unit of Florida-based real estate firm Estein USA — was late on its May debt service payment. The company now contends it has made that payment. The loan was transferred to Rialto Capital Management for special servicing, the report noted.Illinois is one of the last states that has remained essentially locked down amid the pandemic, and in Chicago, overall hotel occupancy rates were at 24 percent, according to the latest numbers from hospitality research firm STR.The desperation in Estein COO Lance Fair’s words were apparent when discussing the situation. “We need the mayor to open the city back up and get the city back open for business,” Fair said, according to Crain’s.Nationwide, U.S. hotel occupancy rates have plummeted — although they are slowly rising as states reopen for business in stages — and the commercial mortgage-backed securities market has seized up. Billions in hotel loans have been sent to special servicing.Locally, Thor Equities skipped its April loan payment on the $427 million refinance it took out on the 1,600-key Palmer House Hilton. Thor bought the Palmer House for $230 million in 2005, and finished a $131 million renovation in 2008. The CMBS loan was transferred to a special servicer when Thor failed to pay its $1 million debt service.

February’s five biggest multifamily deals traded for $239 million, more than double the $115 million spent in January but less than the $245 million recorded in December.After the Avanath purchase, April’s second- and third-biggest deals were for suburban apartment complexes, both of which sold in the $11 million range.All prices are drawn from Cook County property records.1. 4215 North Broadway | $28.3 millionThe purchase of the 156-unit Scotland Yard complex in Uptown is Avanath’s latest acquisition in its Chicago affordable housing buying spree. Avanath bought at least four properties in the area since 2018, including spending $15.5 million for an Old Town complex in March. The Scotland Yard complex is income-restricted and is open to seniors and families.2. 725 Bode Circle, Hoffman Estates | $11.9 millionTwo Chicago firms teamed up to by the 550-unit Autumn Chase Apartments in suburban Hoffman Estates, with Tricap Residential Group and Wolcott Group spending nearly $12 million for the property. The buyers also picked up nearly $50 million in debt that seller Greenwood Capital Investments took out on the property in 2015. Tricap bought over 550 rental units in the market in the last 14 months.3. 4791 Hickory Creek Drive, University Park | $11.2 millionPeak Capital Partners bought this south suburban multifamily complex for just over $11 million, representing its first acquisition in the Chicago market. The Arbors at Hickory Creek is a 176-unit complex with a number of units designated for housing voucher recipients. Selling the property was the New Jersey-based Michaels Organization.4. 6700 South Merrill Avenue | $4 millionThis nearly century-old apartment building in South Shore was sold to Tyler Deroo and Stephen Lee, who are partners at Capital Investors. The building includes 50 units primarily made up of one- and two-bedrooms and is across the street from Jackson Park.

But that has changed. And on the sales side, over 12,000 Chicago-area homes were purchased in April, continuing a nine-month hot streak, according to a recent report.Rental properties are also filling up again, and landlords and prospective buyers are taking notice. In late April, the 548-unit Shoreham apartment tower in Lakeshore East hit the market. PNC Realty Investors oversees the Shoreham at 400 E. South Water Street for owner AFL-CIO Building Investment Trust. The asking price was not known, but buildings comparable to the 47-story complex have in recent years sold for up to $500,000 per unit.And last month, Alex Najem’s Fulton St. Companies proposed 1.1 million square feet of residential and office buildings in Fulton Market.

Builders that an inspection earlier this month found a “hazardous” temporary electrical system behind a new house in the 6500 block of West Dickens Avenue. An “exposed live electrical cable was looped from building to building” to illegally connect power to three other houses in the Belmont-Cragin neighborhood, the document continued.City buildings officials issued a stop work order on the houses, cut off their electrical service and ordered occupants to vacate the homes.Buildings department records show a permit was issued for electrical wiring at the Dickens Avenue house on Aug. 10, four days after the inspector was said to have visited.The suspension is set to take effect Monday, though the developer has until then to request a hearing with the buildings department to contest the it.Tyler Manic, an attorney representing Noah Properties, wrote in an email that the “matters raised in the notice have been resolved,” but did not specify which violations, or whether the suspension was overturned.A city official said that a partial occupancy permit has been issued for one of the four buildings, but violations remain on all four properties.Founded by Przyjemski and Anita Lisek in 2002, Noah lists dozens of single-family homes and multi-unit residential buildings in its portfolio, most of them on the city’s red-hot Near Northwest Side.A couple sued the company last year, alleging defects in the HVAC system and windows of the Wicker Park condo they bought for $650,000 in 2014. The suit, which remains underway, which spurred Noah to file its own legal complaint against A.L.L. Builders. The city also sued the developer for building violations, then backed off when the violations were addressed.The city’s Aug. 17 notice described an Aug. 7 meeting between city buildings inspectors and Noah Properties, during which the electrician who had been permitted to work on the Dickens Avenue property said he had not handled any of the wiring there. Instead, a man who said “he is not a licensed electrician” and “is not employed by a supervising electrical contractor” installed the system “at the direction of Bart Przyjemski,” the city document reads.The city cited seven explicit violations that led to Noah’s license suspension, including one saying the company and associated contractor “performed or directed work that poses an immediate or imminent threat to the health and safety of workers or the public.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",6500 block of West Dickens Avenue,The city’s buildings, department is suspending Noah Properties’ real estate developer’s license over shoddy wiring that was installed by an unlicensed electrician at four of its newly-built homes.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/08/24/noah-properties-city-building-license-yanked-for-electrical-violations/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The city’s buildings</a> department is suspending Noah Properties’ real estate developer’s license over shoddy wiring that was installed by an unlicensed electrician at four of its newly-built homes.","6500 block of West Dickens Avenue Chicago, IL","6500 W Dickens Ave, Chicago, IL 60707, USA","(41.9181983, -87.7877106, 0.0)",41.9181983,-87.7877106,0.0,2018

An $8 million in tax increment financing was also granted for the project.Originally proposed in 2019, the project secured low income housing tax credit financing in 2021. Initial plans called for a five-story building with 5,000 square feet of retail, 51 affordable housing units, 41 public parking spaces and 9 private parking spaces. The project hit a snag, however, when the city told developers there was too much parking and that it needed to be accessed from an alley instead of North Western Avenue.The new plan calls for a six-story building with 65 new affordable units, 5,000 square feet of ground floor commercial space and an outdoor public space. There will be a second-floor parking deck with 36 spaces — 18 for public use and 18 reserved for residents. The building will have a green roof and rooftop deck for residents.Despite initial traffic concerns, the parking entrance will remain on North Western Avenue, as many local businesses said the alley entrance would cause more logistical headaches.The city-owned parcels, which have been appraised at $4.925 million, will be sold to the developers for $6 — or $1 per parcel. The $35.7 million project will be funded by a $3.5 million mortgage, $8 million in TIF, $8 million in a DOH loan, $1.5 million in state tax credit donations and $14.5 million in low income housing tax credits.The funding funding plan is now headed to City Hall for approval. The zoning application will also begin seeking approvals from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning and the City Council.Construction is set to begin as early as Spring 2023.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",4715 North Western Avenue,Two developers got, good news this week when Chicago’s Community Development Commission approved the sale of city-owned land in Lincoln Square to make way for a mixed-use building.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/09/16/two-developers-greenlit-for-mixed-use-project-in-lincoln-square/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Two developers got</a> good news this week when Chicago’s Community Development Commission approved the sale of city-owned land in Lincoln Square to make way for a mixed-use building.","4715 North Western Avenue Chicago, IL","4715 N Western Ave, Chicago, IL 60625, USA","(41.966865, -87.688619, 0.0)",41.966865,-87.688619,0.0,2022

02:00 PM","Heading into the 2019 election season, real estate interests appeared to be lining up behind veteran Alderman Danny Solis (25th), whose chairmanship of the City Council’s crucial Zoning Committee made him a coveted ally for anyone trying to build in Chicago.","[""From left: Hilario Dominguez, Byron Sigcho-Lopez, Aida Flores, Alex Acevedo, Troy Hernandez and The 78 site (Credit: Facebook)Heading into the 2019 election season, real estate interests appeared to be lining up behind veteran Alderman Danny Solis (25th), whose chairmanship of the City Council’s crucial Zoning Committee made him a coveted ally for anyone trying to build in Chicago.The Belgravia Group, McCaffery Interests and the Chicagoland Apartment Association all made donations to Solis’ campaign fund, election records show.But in November, Solis announced he would not run for re-election, and last month he ceded control of the zoning committee after being implicated in a scheme to use his power to help developers in exchange for personal favors.The corruption scandal scrambled the wide-open race to replace Solis, pushing all five candidates to sprint away from Solis and his legacy of coziness with the real estate industry. All of them have pledged to make zoning more collaborative and transparent, and to either dissolve or democratize Solis’ Pilsen Land Use Committee.Whoever wins will be empowered to chart a new course for development in the gentrifying Pilsen neighborhood and in parts of the booming South Loop. The winner will also preside over the 62-acre field where Related Midwest won approval for its The 78 campus. Two candidates, activist Byron Sigcho-Lopez and nurse Alex Acevedo, earlier this month called for the city to delay the approval process for The 78.Unlike in the nearby 27th Ward, where developers have made at least $160,000 in contributions for a far less competitive race, real estate groups appear to have mostly stayed away from the contest to succeed Solis, according to an analysis of campaign donations by The Real Deal. Industry professionals appear to have spent just over $34,000 to influence the race, a fraction of the $392,000 raised by all five candidates as of Wednesday.Alex AcevedoAcevedo, the son of former state Rep. Edward Acevedo, appears to have received more donations from the real estate industry than any of the five candidates, with at least a quarter of his $94,000 fundraising total coming from developers, brokers or building groups.Most of Acevedo’s real estate donations came from builders and building trades, including $5,000 each from John James Construction and LiUNA Chicago Laborers, the union that also donated $250,000 to Susana Mendoza’s mayoral campaign.Acevedo also received $5,000 from James Horan, who owned the property at 1061 West Van Buren Street before selling it to Ohio-based developer Pizzuti Companies. Pizzuti later teamed with Related Midwest on plans for a 300-unit apartment building on the site.The Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters donated $2,500 to Acevedo’s campaign, and Heat & Frost Insulators Local 17 donated $2,000.“I’m proud to be endorsed by the unions, like LiUNA, Operating Engineers, Carpenters and Plumbers, which continue to offer our communities careers and living wages upon which our residents can raise a family,” Acevedo wrote in a statement. “I have also been outspoken on our need for a full audit of the development process, including my call to review Chicago’s zoning process in the wake of Solis’ corruption.”Aida FloresFormer school principal Aida Flores received the second-most real estate donations in the race, with at least $8,000 of her $76,000 fundraising total coming from the industry.But the bulk of that sum came from her sister, Century 21 agent Areli Flores, who donated $5,000.“I really believe in what she’s doing,” Areli Flores said. “She’s a great human being, and she’s always worked hard.”Flores also received donations of $1,000 each from DSO Properties and Jeffrey Malk of Keeler Real Estate.Hilario DominguezHilario Dominguez, a 25-year-old teacher endorsed by U.S. Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, landed the largest single donation in the race: $32,000 from Purple PAC, a group that has heavily supported Northwest Side Alderman Gilbert Villegas (36th) and Mendoza’s mayoral candidacy.But as far as real estate industry donors, Dominguez has counted few supporters. Acme Refining, a McKinley Park scrap metal shop, donated $1,500 last month. He got another $1,000 from Wells Plumbing & Heating.In all, about 5 percent of the $98,000 raised by Dominguez came from the real estate industry.Byron Sigcho-LopezSigcho-Lopez appears to be the top fundraiser in the race, with just over $106,000 donated so far, no thanks to real estate donors.The community organizer raked in tens of thousands of dollars from public-sector unions like the Chicago Teachers Union and Service Employees International Union, the same groups buoying Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle’s campaign for mayor.But TRD could not identify any developers, brokers or builder groups that have signed checks in support of Sigcho-Lopez’s campaign.Troy HernandezNone of the nearly $18,000 in donations received by data scientist Troy Hernandez’s campaign can be directly tied to real estate professionals or interest groups.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1061 West Van Buren Street,Heading into the," 2019 election season, real estate interests appeared to be lining up behind veteran Alderman Danny Solis (25th), whose chairmanship of the City Council’s crucial Zoning Committee made him a coveted ally for anyone trying to build in Chicago.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/02/22/developers-stay-away-from-race-to-replace-disgraced-alderman-solis/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Heading into the</a> 2019 election season, real estate interests appeared to be lining up behind veteran Alderman Danny Solis (25th), whose chairmanship of the City Council’s crucial Zoning Committee made him a coveted ally for anyone trying to build in Chicago.","1061 West Van Buren Street Chicago, IL","1061 W Van Buren St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8764782, -87.6542326, 0.0)",41.8764782,-87.6542326,0.0,2019

That home has a few other distinctions in addition to Barbie: the state’s largest residential pool and palm trees that have been flown in annually from Florida.Other top sales in the area ranged from $1.3 million to $1.6 million, a narrower range than June, when the top five ranged between $1.06 million and $2.2 million. The data was collated by Zillow from information provided by Midwest Real Estate Data and doesn’t include off-market deals. Read on for thumbnails of the top five.1) 13360 W 167th St, Homer Glen, $5.3 million\nThe 15,000-square-foot home sits on 4.5 acres on 167th Street, about 40 miles from downtown Chicago. It has a fountain court with a triple-arched entry and cut-stone walls, five bedrooms and nine bathrooms.The home includes multiple chandeliers, one in the primary bedroom and another in the two-story primary bathroom, which also has a jacuzzi and Greek columns. It has what the listing called the largest home pool in the state, inspired by parts of the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. The home, which has a movie theater, bar, spa and professional gym, also has a 20-car garage.Christine Wilczek and Jason Bacza with Realty Executives Elite represented the sellers and Mark Wright with Baird & Warner working with the buyers.2) 9761 Dewey Cir, Frankfort, $1.6 million\nThis 9,000-square-foot home sold for $1.6 million on July 18. The property includes four fireplaces and an outdoor fire pit, a heated four-car garage, wet bar, custom trophy cases, workout room, basketball court and in-ground saltwater pool.Built in 2005, the home is on about half an acre and has a four-car garage. Jessica Jakubowski with @properties Christie’s International Real Estate represented the sellers and Sunny Burfeind of Landen Home Realty the buyers.3) 1219 Bonnema Ct, Naperville, $1.5 million\nThis 6,600-square-foot home closed for $1.5 million on July 15. Built in 2002, it has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms. Kim Scott of @properties Christie’s International Real Estate represented the sellers and Antonia Dimeola with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Chicago the buyers.The home was listed on May 28 and was under contract two days later, selling for the asking price. That’s significantly less than the $1.89 million that it sold for in 2002, according to Will County property records.4) 3908 Littlestone Cir, Naperville, $1.3 million\nThis 5,000-square-foot home, a six-bedroom, seven-bathroom home built in 2004, closed for $1.32 million on July 11. That’s well below the $4 million it was asking on April 22, and it went under contract May 2. The property includes a home theater and a 2,800-square-foot outdoor living space with custom European pavers imported from Denmark. The owners spent more than $750,000 to renovate the home during the past 10 years, according to the listing.Deepak Mehta with RE/MAX Professionals Select represented the sellers and Bob Dellutri with Wall Street Property Group the buyers.5) 12 Baker Ln, Naperville, $1.4 million\nThis 5,000-square-foot house, a five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home built in 2006 on one-third of an acre, sold for $1.4 million on July 15, compared with $1 million in 2009. It asked $1.395 million when it hit the market on April 14, and came under contract on April 18. The property includes a mudroom with a built-in dog kennel, a sunroom, a full bar with kitchenette, a home gym and a media room.

The couple paid nearly $1.4 million for the 4,000-square-foot house after it was featured in a January 2019 episode of “Windy City Rehab.”The Morrisseys claim they have since spent $80,000 to fix the problem-”plagued” home at 2308 West Giddings Street, including severe leaks, along with an improperly installed roof and windows.The Morrisseys filed a lawsuit against co-stars Alison Victoria Gramenos and her former partner, Donovan Eckhardt, to reverse the sale receive compensation for the repairs. Last month, the couple Discovery Inc., the parent company of HGTV, in the lawsuit.“Discovery’s promotion, endorsement, sponsorship, approval and certification that Victoria and Eckhardt were experts in real estate renovation and development was a determinative factor in Plaintiff’s decision to enter into the agreement,” the couple said in a motion filed late last month in Cook County Circuit Court. The couple is seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting Discovery from endorsing, sponsoring and promoting the “Windy City Rehab” hosts.In a separate motion, Gramenos and her lawyers argue that the couple’s request to shut down the show violates freedom of speech rights.

09:07 AM","Valor Equity Partners, an early backer of Elon Musk ventures, is moving its Chicago offices to a Tishman Speyer-owned building in the Fulton Market district from the Magnificent Mile.","[""320 N Sangamon with Valor Equity Partners CEO Antonio Gracias and Tishman Speyer CEO Rob Speyer (Valor Equity Partners, Tishman Speyer, 320NSangamon )Valor Equity Partners, an early backer of Elon Musk ventures, is moving its Chicago offices to a Tishman Speyer-owned building in the Fulton Market district from the Magnificent Mile.The private equity firm is leasing more than 24,000 square feet on the top floor of 320 North Sangamon Street, a 13-story building that opened last year, Crain’s reported, citing people familiar with the deal.The move marks an expansion from the firm’s 12,000 square feet at the tower formerly called the John Hancock Center at 875 North Michigan Avenue on Chicago’s most famous retail strip, the Magnificent Mile. Valor’s two leases there expire by the end of next year.It’s the latest win for Tishman, which developed the 270,000-square-foot Sangamon Street property with Chicago’s Mark Goodman on speculation, without signing tenants before the pandemic drained downtown demand.The partnership defied the public health crisis. The building has been among Chicago’s best-performing of the pandemic, landing tenants such as biotech startup Hazel Technologies across 50,000 square feet as well as real estate tech company VTS, which leased 36,000. It’s now 87 percent leased. Hazel’s buildout of its lab and office space was just completed by Skender Construction, and its needs for lab space helped motivate the developers to alter their plans to include features required by life sciences and research and development teams.Tishman and Goodman just scored a $26.1 million loan on the property from Wells Fargo, a sign of its strong performance and ability to carry more debt after obtaining an $81.4 million construction loan in 2019.Valor’s exit from the Mag Mile is the latest tenant loss for Chicago’s Hearn, the firm that owns 875 North Michigan. One of its largest tenants, software firm SMS Assist, exited 85,000 square feet in the skyscraper six months ago when it moved to the Prudential Plaza complex at 130 East Randolph Street. The former Hancock Center’s landlord is in the midst of adjusting much of its office space for medical office tenants, rebranding it as the Mag Mile Medical Pavilion to market to doctors and hospitals that might want clinics in the building.Four new medical office leases totaling 35,000 square feet are being completed on the Mag Mile landmark, and the landlord may dedicate even more space within the tower to medical users than the 125,000 square feet planned now, Hearn President and CEO Steve Hearn told Crain’s. “We’ve had a very strong response,” Hearn said.Robert Sevim of Savills negotiated the Valor Equity lease on behalf of the firm, while Tishman’s Adam Mitchell and Ellen May oversee leasing at the Fulton Market building.[Crain’s] — Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",320 North Sangamon Street,Valor Equity," Partners, an early backer of Elon Musk ventures, is moving its Chicago offices to a Tishman Speyer-owned building in the Fulton Market district from the Magnificent Mile.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/06/02/valor-equity-leases-tishman-fulton-market-building-ditches-hancock/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Valor Equity</a> Partners, an early backer of Elon Musk ventures, is moving its Chicago offices to a Tishman Speyer-owned building in the Fulton Market district from the Magnificent Mile.","320 North Sangamon Street Chicago, IL","320 N Sangamon St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.887304, -87.6513303, 0.0)",41.887304,-87.6513303,0.0,2022

His wife, Mae, and mother, Teresa, signed the deed for the home, paying $5,500.Capone did not return to the home after getting out of prison in 1939, moving instead to Florida, where he lived until dying in 1947.

01:00 PM","After years of major downtown office deals, investor activity in the sector has virtually gone dark.","[""Investment sales of Downtown office properties have cooled, hitting a 20-year low (Credit: iStock)After years of major downtown office deals, investor activity in the sector has virtually gone dark.Investment sales of office buildings in the central business district dropped to a 20-year-low this year, according to a new report from MB Real Estate. Through two quarters, only seven office buildings totaling less than 1 million square feet have traded, the report said.The lack of investor activity comes despite a surge of available properties in the central business district. In May, 22 office buildings were being marketed for sale, likely the most available at one time during this economic cycle, experts told The Real Deal. Currently, there are 16 buildings on the market, with five others under contract, according to MBRE.The downtown office market had a particularly quiet second quarter, with only one building trading: the $22 million sale of 19 South LaSalle Street, which was bought by local investor Ruben Espinoza. Four other buildings went under contract in the second quarter, according to MBRE. Six office building sales closed in the first quarter.The quiet investor market, plus the surplus of available properties, can be chalked up to changing dynamics in the Chicago office market and changing political headwinds, experts said.For one, a rash of new office developments has increased the competition for tenants. Over 3.5 million square feet of downtown office space was delivered in the last two years, with 2.7 million more square feet expected to come online this year, according to MBRE. The vacancy rate for the Downtown office market stood at 12.5 percent at the end of the second quarter.Some of the city’s biggest office tenants, including BMO Harris and Bank of America, will leave the Central Loop for new office buildings. The large vacancies that will be created by those moves dampened investor appetite for some properties.But the single biggest factor hurting the office investor market in Chicago is the uncertainty over future commercial property taxes, said Kevin Purcell, president of Leasing and Management Services for MBRE.“The uncertainty involving real estate taxes is causing a lot of people to think twice about investing,” Purcell said.New Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi is working to overhaul the property tax system that he said unfairly penalizes homeowners in favor of commercial landlords. Some commercial properties, including apartment buildings in Evanston, have already seen big tax increases. Downtown properties will be reassessed in 2021.Investor activity will likely be at a minimum until there is more of an idea of what taxes could look like in the future, Purcell said.“Pushing more of the burden onto commercial assets, that will have a detrimental effect going forward,” he said.The lack of recent deals does not mean investors have completely tuned out Chicago, Purcell said. Job creation and corporate relocations to the city remain strong, both good indicators for the office market.Guidance on the future of real estate taxes — and the continued strong absorption and lease signings — will likely lead to a return of the investment sales market, Purcell said.“When you see pricing on the coasts, Chicago still represents a value,” Purcell said. “There’s strong interest. The real estate taxes become the problem.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",22 million sale of 19 South LaSalle Street,After years of major," downtown office deals, investor activity in the sector has virtually gone dark.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/07/22/downtown-office-investment-sales-activity-hits-20-year-low-report/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">After years of major</a> downtown office deals, investor activity in the sector has virtually gone dark.","22 million sale of 19 South LaSalle Street Chicago, IL","19 South LaSalle Street, 19 S La Salle St, Chicago, IL 60602, USA","(41.8813955, -87.63186259999999, 0.0)",41.8813955,-87.63186259999999,0.0,2019

The only other local building with homes that high is the St. Regis, where a duplex condo on the 92nd and 93rd floors is listed for $18.5 million.“The view is breathtaking, and every day it’s something different,” Danielle Richter said. With east- and south-facing walls of windows, “we see the whole lake and the whole skyline.”The couple decided to sell their sky-high Chicago home after splitting their time between the city and New York, where Glenn is based as CFO of International Flavors and Fragrances. The condo, a combination of two separate units, has an L-shaped main area with sections for the living room, kitchen, media room and dining room.“People have their affinity for lake or city views,” Danielle Richter said. “But we don’t have to decide because we have both.”The flooring throughout the home is travertine, a nod to the building’s mid-20th century origin. The media room, at one end of the L-shape, can be separated from the rest of the home with a movable wall that retracts into the ceiling.The kitchen is decorated with white and mirrored surfaces, including the extra-thick slab of quartzite used for the island. Wall-height antique mirrors also “reflect the lake and the sky” in the kitchen.The primary bedroom suite, which includes a sitting area and a fireplace, was built in the space that used to be a separate studio apartment. In addition, the condo’s library also has a wall of shelves that can slide open to reveal a Murphy bed and a full bathroom attached.The condo will be listed on an agents-only network soon and will hit the multiple-listing service on June 22.[CCB] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",75 North Michigan Avenue,A rare 92-floor, condo with walls of windows overlooking Chicago and Lake Michigan is hitting the market.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/06/08/rare-92nd-floor-condo-in-former-hancock-tower-asks-4-5m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A rare 92-floor</a> condo with walls of windows overlooking Chicago and Lake Michigan is hitting the market.","75 North Michigan Avenue Chicago, IL","75 Michigan Ave, Chicago, IL 60601, USA","(41.88160389999999, -87.6241014, 0.0)",41.88160389999999,-87.6241014,0.0,2022

The West Loop, River North and North Michigan Avenue submarkets averaged the sharpest rent spikes, all posting year-over-year gains of more than a dollar per square foot.But the rent numbers hide the widening popularity of tenant concession packages landlords are offering to fill their buildings, which drag down net effective rents, Colliers International senior vice president Corby Marx said.“We’ve been seeing landlords in (class) B or B-plus buildings having to get really aggressive in fighting over that class of tenants,” Marx said. “Tenants are less willing to pay new-construction rental rates, so I thought these numbers would be ticking down a bit further.”The sharply higher tenant demand for class-A office buildings is pushing class-B landlords to shell out for major renovations, Marx added.About 139,000 square feet of Downtown office space were absorbed into the market last quarter, a positive but significantly slower figure than the 662,000 square feet Colliers measured during the second quarter.Rents and absorption were both boosted by WeWork’s pair of new leases totaling more than 200,000 square feet in River North this fall. The coworking giant’s expansions into 330 North Wabash Avenue and 515 North State Street accounted for the bulk of River North’s positive net absorption last quarter and helped shave the neighborhood’s vacancy rate from 9.1 percent to 7.6 percent.Big names like Facebook,\xa0Salesforce and CIBC\xa0are shepherding a pack of new tech and finance tenants to “buoy the overall market” for office space while other firms are shrinking or consolidating their footprints, Marx said.Landlords took a hit when W.W. Grainger and Holland & Knight both shrank their Chicago footprints last quarter, weighing down rents and cutting net absorption across the map.A CBRE report earlier this month measured a jump in the third quarter Downtown vacancy rate to 13.3 percent from 13 percent the previous quarter\xa0and 12.9 percent during the first quarter of 2018.Newmark Knight Frank, meanwhile, found that citywide office rents hit record highs last quarter.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",515 North State Street,Downtown office," rents remained flat and absorption slowed in the third quarter, signaling the environment may be tipping in favor of tenants.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/10/22/downtown-office-rents-stuck-absorption-slows-in-lackluster-q3-report/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Downtown office</a> rents remained flat and absorption slowed in the third quarter, signaling the environment may be tipping in favor of tenants.","515 North State Street Chicago, IL","515 N State St, Chicago, IL 60654, USA","(41.8914211, -87.6273487, 0.0)",41.8914211,-87.6273487,0.0,2018

That makes it one of the most expensive deconversions in Chicago.The deal to sell all 449 units in the South Loop complex at 800 Wells Street came months after the owners balked when Marc Realty abruptly lowered its offer for the building, according to the Chicago Tribune.Marc Realty had sought to buy the complex since early 2016, and in December the sides agreed to a $100 million sale. In May, Marc Realty and partner Wolcott Group lowered their offering price to $89 million, saying they’d discovered costly repairs that would have to be made.Owners rejected that price, and Marc Realty came back with a revised offer of $90.5 million that was accepted Aug. 28, the owners’ attorney Kelly Elmore told the Tribune. The deal was approved by 78 percent of owners, just above the 75 percent required under Illinois law to force a bulk sale.Marc Realty will add another $1 million if all sale documents are in order within the next three months, Elmore said.The deal would be the second-highest price in Chicago for a deconversion, behind the pending $112 million sale of the 391-unit building at 1400 N. Lake Shore Drive to New York-based ESG Kullen.The most expensive deconversion by per-unit price would be a deal in the works for JMB Realty Corp. to pay $36 million for a 68-unit condo tower at 110 East Delaware in the Gold Coast, which works out to more than $529,000 per unit. Most deconversions average in the $200,000s per unit.Owners at 110 East Delaware still have to approve the deal, brokered by CBRE’s Sam Haddadin.

Providing the loan was Angelo Gordon’s mortgage investment trust, property records show.The new loan comes less than two years after Sterling Bay took out a five-year, $41 million loan from Mesa West for the Talbott Hotel. That loan came in late 2017, shortly after Sterling Bay unveiled a $20 million renovation of the hotel that added 29 rooms.Sterling Bay acquired the hotel in 2015 as part of a joint venture that included Conlon & Co., actor John Cusack, retired hockey player Chris Chelios, restaurateur Bill Rancic and billionaire hotel investor John Pritzker, Crain’s reported at the time. The venture bought the hotel for $51 million, the paper reported.The Talbott Hotel has 179 rooms and was built in 1927. A representative from Sterling Bay did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Sterling Bay is less known for its hotel investments than its major development projects, many of them in Fulton Market. The Lincoln Yards developer earlier this month unveiled plans for two new Fulton Market towers, one to be used as apartments and one as office space. The firm has also recently put up for sale its Fulton Market headquarters, seeking $200 million for the property.Sterling Bay also recently received initial city approval for its plans to construct a 46-story tower on North Michigan Avenue that would house 289 residential units, a hotel and ground-floor commercial space.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",20 East Delaware Place,Two years after it," renovated and refinanced the property, Sterling Bay has taken out a new loan on its Gold Coast hotel.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/07/31/sterling-bay-takes-on-new-debt-at-renovated-talbott-hotel-in-gold-coast/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Two years after it</a> renovated and refinanced the property, Sterling Bay has taken out a new loan on its Gold Coast hotel.","20 East Delaware Place Chicago, IL","20 E Delaware Pl, Chicago, IL 60611, USA","(41.8994463, -87.6274692, 0.0)",41.8994463,-87.6274692,0.0,2019

The application didn’t say whether the project is an apartment or condo building, and Shapack didn’t return calls seeking comment. If it’s apartments, the firm will have to set aside 20 percent of the units for affordable housing.Jeff Shapack, who leads the firm, bought the 27,000-square-foot parcel for $8.5 million in 2018. His company has built or redeveloped properties including the 182-key Hoxton Hotel, a 29-story residential building dubbed The Parker, and the 84,700-square-foot WeWork office building. The firm has at least nine projects totaling 960,000 square feet that are either completed or proposed, according to CoStar.Last month, Shapack filed a zoning application to the City Council to replace a 156,000-square-foot facility at 170 North Green Street with a building of 275 apartments, office space, and 150 hotel rooms. The tallest portion of the building will rise at the corner of Lake and Peoria streets, while the rest would be about 14 stories high.Fulton Market was largely immune to the pandemic as developers bought the last remaining parcels to develop them into Class A buildings.

Patton.The CEO of 548 Development, which has led projects city officials viewed favorably, said he has acquired property in the 3800 block of West Chicago Avenue with plans to include adjacent vacant city-owned land in a 60-unit housing redevelopment with a ground-floor grocery store, the Sun-Times reported. Project costs would be $33 million.While terms of Patton’s purchase in the West Humboldt Park neighborhood have not yet been disclosed in public records, the property containing single-story industrial buildings is bookended by vacant city parcels and last changed hands for $300,000 in 2019, when its current owner, Denis Vulich, bought it.The new mixed-use housing project will use solar panels to produce energy and include triple-pane windows to improve insulation, which will help make it the city’s largest “passive housing” structure, Patton told the Sun-Times, referring to housing designs maximizing energy efficiency.He wants its residents to have electric bills that are half the cost of comparable buildings and to cut the need for natural gas.“We’re solving … multiple community issues here,” he told the outlet. “It will be affordable, sustainable housing,” and he plans to have minority-owned contractors lead the project. “We’ve been very intentional about that,” he said.Patton’s foray into development began with rehabs of small apartment buildings a few years ago, and, as a Black entrepreneur, he has emphasized hiring minority-led contractors. He has obtained financing from sources other than banks that are less willing to invest in communities of color, and minority-owned firms Milhouse Engineering & Construction and Powers & Sons Construction will lead general contracting duties on the Chicago Avenue project, should it move forward.Chicago’s top planning official Maurice Cox has called Patton “an up and comer,” according to the Sun-Times.The Chicago Avenue site is along a business corridor Mayor Lori Lightfoot is aiming to improve through the Invest South/West initiative, a program meant to bring economic development to areas that have been ignored by investors.It usually involves developers making competing bids for blighted or underdeveloped property that owners have agreed to sell, and the city picks a winner. Patton has been awarded three other parcels through the Invest South/West program, his largest being the 21-acre former Copenhagen chewing tobacco plant where 548 Development is working with Related Midwest to build solar-powered warehousing.The project still requires approval from the city for a zoning change to move forward, and Patton is asking the city for $8 million in tax increment financing, which allows local governments to put property tax revenues generated by new development toward covering the costs of the improvements. The tax increment financing also still has to be approved by the city.Patton plans to break ground in the fall and open the project in 2024.[Sun-Times] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",3831 W Chicago Avenue,Chicago might have a, soft spot for A.J.

In the city and suburbs, some companies with expiring leases have downsized in moves or renewals, sometimes by as much as a quarter of the space they rented pre-pandemic.It is unclear where Fubo Gaming will head next. A spokeswoman for the company told Crain’s that Fubo Gaming “continues to be committed to locating its headquarters in Chicago.”Sublease offerings are drawing tenants looking for savings by renting at discounted rates from a tenant that has downsized or left a lease early rather than directly from a landlord at full price. A sublease offering at 515 North State Street is being considered by publicly traded cannabis company Verano Holdings, while marketing software company Braze subleased 50,000 square feet at 1 North State Street from another software firm Showpad early this year.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1 North Dearborn Street,Chicago’s third-hand, market is gaining some office supply.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/03/29/subleasing-a-sublease-quick-exit-by-chicago-sportsbook-adds-to-office-oversupply/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Chicago’s third-hand</a> market is gaining some office supply.","1 North Dearborn Street Chicago, IL","1 N Dearborn St, Chicago, IL 60602, USA","(41.8823576, -87.6291667, 0.0)",41.8823576,-87.6291667,0.0,2022

The projects are expected to include more than 215 residential units and 40,000 square feet of commercial space on vacant or underutilized sites, according to Crain’s.“One of my highest priorities is bringing catalytic investments to our South and West Side communities, which have gone far too long without revitalization,” Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement. “These new projects will allow us to do that and represent an important collaboration between our city departments and the communities we serve.”Lawndale RedefinedUnited Yards is the most ambitious $51.5 million multi-use project. A joint venture of Celadon Partners and the Blackwood Group seeks to redevelop a vacant, city-owned lot at 1515 W. 47th St. with a 50-unit affordable apartment building. Additional phases will also redevelop a vacant, four-story building at 4701 S.

The announcement of $67 million in investment proposals for the developments in Austin, Auburn Gresham and Englewood neighborhoods came in early March. The mayor’s three-year program Invest South/West Initiative plans to invest $750 million in developments across 10 neighborhoods on the South and West sides.In March, Lightfoot also proposed an overhaul of Chicago’s Affordable Ordinance. She called for doubling the amount of required affordable units in new construction, which opponents said it will discourage development.The city will review the proposed developments with the Plan Commission and the City Council.

An above-ground parking garage would be built immediately to the east to service the entire development.The first phase would also create a tree-lined pedestrian “slipway” leading into the site from Southport Avenue and a partial extension of Kingsbury Street. Scott Duncan, a partner at lead architecture firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, said Kingsbury would be a “shared street” like Argyle Street in Uptown, but a diagram of the road showed distinct sidewalks and unprotected bike lanes.“It’s important to be able to create a destination on day one, and create a sense of neighborhood immediately by defining the streetscape,” Duncan said. “At this point, the site is so empty that putting a single building there wouldn’t really achieve that.”Planners also shaved a combined 100 stories off the heights of buildings across the development since the previous version of the proposal, including lowering its tallest building from 800 feet to 650 feet. But principal Keating Crown said Thursday the site still would be built to accommodate up to 5,000 residents and 23,000 permanent jobs, the same benchmarks the company set in July.Sarah Astheimer, a principal of the landscape architecture firm James Corner Field Operations, showed lush renderings of the seven publicly-accessible parks and plazas being proposed under the expanded 21-acre collection of open spaces.The north section of Lincoln Yards would include a “foundry playground” with tube slides that mimic the Finkl Steel foundry, a “furnace garden” with open firepits, a “great lawn” facing the river and three overlook decks allowing people to step down to the water.Plans for the south section of the site include two soccer fields and a baseball field just north of the 20,000-seat stadium where a United Soccer League expansion team would play.Sterling Bay and city officials have both pointed to a proposed “transitway” between Downtown and Lincoln Yards as a key to managing the heavy traffic that would accompany a professional sports venue. But few details have been released on the proposed route, including which agency would operate it.“Overlook decks” over the North Branch of the Chicago RiverAlderman Brian Hopkins (2nd), who earlier this year moved to block City Council discussion of the proposal until it earned his approval, said he was noncommittal on the newest version of Sterling Bay’s plan but said that “there seems to be something close to consensus for something like” it.The alderman also rebuffed a resident’s request to hold his decision until next year’s mayoral election, saying he would not “intentionally slow it down for no good reason.”Earlier this month, city planners proposed creating a new tax increment financing district they said could raise up to $800 million to help fund public infrastructure improvements around Lincoln Yards.Erin Lavin Cabonargi, Sterling Bay’s former director of development who presented Sterling Bay’s plan during the July meeting, has since left the company to run her own development and consulting firms.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1515 West Webster Avenue,Sterling Bay," executives presented their updated pitch Thursday night for the 53-acre Lincoln Yards super-development, previewing a pair of office buildings and a network of green spaces designed to win over neighbors pushing for more parkland.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/11/30/sterling-bay-unveils-first-office-building-designs-in-lincoln-yards/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Sterling Bay</a> executives presented their updated pitch Thursday night for the 53-acre Lincoln Yards super-development, previewing a pair of office buildings and a network of green spaces designed to win over neighbors pushing for more parkland.","1515 West Webster Avenue Chicago, IL","1515 W Webster Ave, Chicago, IL 60614, USA","(41.92105160000001, -87.6665125, 0.0)",41.92105160000001,-87.6665125,0.0,2018

Martin Luther King Jr. moved into an apartment on Hamlin Avenue to highlight the squalid conditions African-Americans were living in all over the country. More than a half-century later, observers both in and outside Chicago still hold up North Lawndale as an example of everything wrong with American cities.Lawndale was the opening case study in Ta-Nehisi Coates’ 2014 “A Case for Reparations,” and newspaper headlines daily report how gun violence and opioid addiction are ravaging the neighborhood’s residents.Despite it all, North Lawndale is sitting on assets that real estate professionals say make a comeback inevitable, if not foreseeable. The area’s 1890s heyday left it with one of the highest concentrations of historic greystone buildings in the city, and a two-mile L-shaped boulevard carves a lush green path to the 173-acre Douglas Park.It’s one of just a few neighborhoods outside Downtown that’s accessible by two CTA rail lines, and it’s home to the 1,700-seat Central Park Theatre, one of Chicago’s most grandiose Vaudeville-era venues. Some buyers have begun to take notice, with home prices appearing to jolt in 2018 after years of flatlining.Today, the combination of creeping interest in adjacent neighborhoods and an accelerating revitalization effort around Sears’ former Homan Square headquarters is mapping out a hopeful future for North Lawndale.In the beginningThe eastern half of North Lawndale was annexed into Chicago in 1869, immediately becoming a home for Bohemian immigrants. Everything west of current-day Pulaski Road, an area known as “K-Town” for its alliterative street names, followed 20 years later, earning a reputation as a mini-metropolis of Czech workers and their families.The neighborhood’s early-20th century ascendance can be tracked through the dozens of ornate houses of worship that still line its streets: Baroque-style Central European Catholic churches were joined by synagogues starting in the 1920s, and Southern Baptist congregations began setting up inside both kinds of buildings after World War II. By 1960, nearly 125,000 people lived in the 11-square-mile area roughly bounded by Western Avenue, Ogden Avenue, Cicero Avenue and Taylor Street.But almost as soon as African-Americans began settling there, the politics of White Flight drove the neighborhood’s wealthier residents to the suburbs, hurried along by “panic-peddler” real estate investors who encouraged homeowners to sell low and fast.The 1968 race riots that scorched the West Side after King’s assassination kicked off a domino effect of big businesses abandoning North Lawndale, most significantly Sears, which shuttered its Homan Square campus in 1974. The neighborhood’s population and wealth have been in freefall ever since.Signs of changeResidents in the northeast corner of the neighborhood saw a turning point starting in 1989, when developer Charles Shaw drew up a redevelopment plan for the 14-story tower and surrounding brick office buildings that used to be Sears’ company headquarters.Homan Square Community CenterSince then, the Homan Square Community Center reopened the 112-year-old tower, which is now home to a hodgepodge of nonprofits and community groups. The Shaw Technological and Learning Center opened in the company’s former power plant building, and last year Mercy Housing Lakefront completed a $65 million redevelopment with 181 affordable apartments in the company’s former mail-order plant.In 2015, the late-summer music festival Riot Fest moved to Douglas Park, pleasing surrounding business owners and introducing thousands of young music fans to the neighborhood.The view from Nichols TowerIn 2016, the leaders of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago decided to focus their “community engagement” efforts exclusively on North Lawndale, and they opened an office in the redeveloped Homan Square tower, now called the Nichols Tower. The school is piloting a five-year project called The Oaks of North Lawndale, modeled after a similar effort in Germany, aiming to plant up to 7,000 trees in the neighborhood by 2023.Also in 2016, the North Lawndale Community Coordinating Council and the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning began working on North Lawndale’s first comprehensive development plan in decades. A seven-chapter draft of the plan, released earlier this year, suggests chartering homeowner groups and launching a marketing push to attract outside investors, among a raft of other recommendations.TransportationNorth Lawndale is hugged by the Blue Line near its northern boundary and the Pink Line at the south, where the Central Park station drops visitors in a growing commercial district anchored by the Lawndale Christian Health Center and a Lou Malnati’s pizzeria.At one time a nexus for a half-dozen streetcar lines, the neighborhood now sees buses run every day along Roosevelt Road, Central Park Avenue, Pulaski Road, 16th Street, Kedzie Avenue and Cermak Road.Separated bike lanes along Central Park Avenue, Independence Boulevard and Douglas Boulevard give cyclists a continuous, if bare-bones, path through the neighborhood.Residential take“I grew up in Logan Square 30 years ago, and it felt kind of like what Lawndale is now — an impoverished community, but one that still had a little bit of everything,” said Moe Pacheco, an Oak Park-based broker with Baird & Warner who sells single-family homes and two-flats in North Lawndale. “It’s become a diverse community with some restaurants and grocery stores, but it hasn’t gentrified. The real estate value in Lawndale hasn’t boomed in the way that it has in neighboring areas like East Garfield Park and Tri-Taylor, which is interesting because it has more amenities and less vacant land than Garfield Park. There’s this misconception that it’s crime-ridden and you have to dodge bullets, but other than construction workers getting their tools stolen, I haven’t run into a lot of [brokers or contractors] who deal with violent crime.”Unity ParkCommercial take“It’s a unique, somewhat thinly-traded market,” said Niko Voutsinas, a Redfin broker who represents buyers of multifamily buildings on the West Side. “For investors who are comfortable with the business model, which is largely Section 8-oriented, it can work. What’s a little frustrating from an agent’s perspective is how little transparency there is in marketing — often it’s either a flip of a flip and the seller knows nothing about it, or it’s a landlord who’s worn out by their tenant and wants to disclose as little as possible. But the risk is baked into the prices, and you can get a steal of deal if you’re comfortable taking it on.

Lake Park Ave., Chicago (Getty, Google Maps)Preservationists are pushing to landmark a Chicago home that legendary blues singer Muddy Waters bought in the 1950s.The group includes city officials and a Waters descendent who owns the North Kenwood home that has fallen into disrepair, according to Crain’s. Local Alderman Sofia King plans to host a virtual community meeting on the proposal in early June, in hopes of getting the proposal to the City Council sometime this year.The home at 4339 S. Lake Park Avenue — called a two-flat — is vacant and has seen better days. Waters’ great-granddaughter Chandra Cooper owns the property. She is raising funds to turn it into the Muddy Waters Mojo Museum; “Got My Mojo Workin’” was one of the singer’s best-known songs.Waters, whose real name was McKinley Morganfield, was born in Mississippi sometime between 1913 and 1915 — dates differ. He spent the first few decades of his life there before moving to Chicago in the early 1940s.He bought the Lake Park Avenue home in 1954 near the height of his fame, and lived there for about 20 years, according to Crain’s. The property passed onto family members after he died in 1983, and has been with the family since.The National Trust for Historic Preservation and Landmarks Illinois have awarded grants toward restoring the property. If landmarked, it would be the second home of a prominent Black historical figure to be designated in the city this year. In January, the Woodlawn building where Emmitt Till once lived, at 6427 S. St. Lawrence Avenue, was landmarked. Till’s 1955 murder in Mississippi at the hands of two white men was a catalyst for the civil rights movement.[Crain’s] — Dennis LynchAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",4339 S.

Neighbors and preservationists had been outraged when the congregation had to leave to make room for condos.“I am deeply committed to preserving the historic Epworth Church building,” Osterman said on Facebook. “I am working with the city of Chicago’s Commission on Chicago Landmarks to landmark Epworth and ensure it will not be demolished.”The church at 5253 North Kenmore Avenue was built with the help of noted architect Frederick B. Townsend. It expanded in the 1930s when a community house was added to accommodate the growing congregation.The church, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, was classified as “orange-rated” under the city’s historic survey, meaning it has “architectural or historic significance in its community.” That meant the demolition requests were subject to a 90-day delay for city officials to decide if it would be appropriate to tear down the structure.The demolition request “flies in the face of what the community wants,” Osterman said.Plans for the redevelopment haven’t been released and the owner hasn’t made any public comments about the project. Osterman said he hasn’t seen the final plans.The Epworth site is already zoned for residential use and has served as a homeless shelter for decades for Cornerstone Community Outreach. Osterman said he’s working with the organization to find a new location for the shelter.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",5253 North Kenmore Avenue,Local opposition, forced a condo developer to shelve plans to demolish a 131-year-old church in Chicago’s suburban Edgewater.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/05/20/church-1-condo-0-1891-building-spared-for-now/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Local opposition</a> forced a condo developer to shelve plans to demolish a 131-year-old church in Chicago’s suburban Edgewater.","5253 North Kenmore Avenue Chicago, IL","5253 N Kenmore Ave, Chicago, IL 60640, USA","(41.977957, -87.65623980000001, 0.0)",41.977957,-87.65623980000001,0.0,2022

It includes a pool and a private beach on Lake Michigan. The home is listed at $6 million, but it won’t be clear if the sellers took a price cut until the deal closes.Jena Radnay, an agent with @properties Christie’s International Real Estate is representing the sellers, who are not identified in public records. She did not respond to a request for comment. Radnay is also the listing agent for the $8 million listing directly next door. The five-bedroom, seven-bathroom modernist home, which has 130 feet of frontage on Lake Michigan, last sold for $5.1 million in 2019.Radnay said in the listing that both properties are available to purchase so a buyer could “combine both lots to make one grand private lakefront two-acre estate.”The home next door is still listed as active on public listing sites, meaning the two will likely have different buyers.The properties join several other ultra high end listings in Glencoe, as the priciest segment of Chicagoland’s housing market is proving most resilient to the broader real estate downturn. Across Chicago and its suburbs, the luxury market continues to have plenty of deals, though many sellers had to take price cuts.The neighboring mansions aren’t the only high-priced properties in the village–and certainly not the most expensive. Glencoe’s priciest homes on the market, at 505 and 595 Longwood Avenue, were both listed through a private network for $14 million each earlier this year, and the property at 595 Longwood has since been publicly marketed.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",333 Surfside Place,A $6 million Glencoe, mansion is the latest luxury home to come under contract and is bucking recent trends with how quickly it found a buyer.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/11/15/6m-glencoe-mansion-goes-under-contract-after-four-days-on-market/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A $6 million Glencoe</a> mansion is the latest luxury home to come under contract and is bucking recent trends with how quickly it found a buyer.","333 Surfside Place Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2022

Ventas’ net operating income was $466.5 million, up 1.1 percent year over year. That came despite its senior housing portfolio seeing same-store net NOI decrease 2.2 percent year over year, to $157.7 million.Ventas Chairman and CEO Debra Cafaro said the senior housing industry continues to see a “mismatch” in deliveries and demand, thanks to increasing supply that’s hit the market recently.“We continue to feel the effects in our senior housing business in elevated openings” of new facilities, Cafaro said during the earnings call.Industry wide, a flood of new senior housing inventory has caused occupancy rates to drop to 88 percent, a 20 basis point decline year-over-year.Ventas officials were hopeful that slowing construction starts will boost their senior housing portfolio. Starts in the first quarter were at the lowest level since the third quarter of 2012, Cafaro said. That’s coupled with the aging of the Baby Boomer generation, which should increase demand increase in the coming years, she said.“As a result of these positive trends … the supply-demand equation will flip in our favor after we work through” current supply, Cafaro said.Ventas is marketing for sale 20 of its senior housing facilities, and expects to net $120 million from the sales, officials said.The stalling of the senior housing market was made up for by Ventas’ investments in research facilities, Cafaro said.Earlier this year, Ventas announced a $1.5 billion investment pipeline into research and innovation facilities, starting with a $77 million development at Arizona State University. In April, Ventas paid $128 million to acquire a research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, between Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Rents at the facility have grown more than 10 percent per year since 2015, according to Ventas.Ventas also signed Yale to a 25-year, 250,000-square-foot lease at its New Haven, Connecticut facility. The university’s school of medicine, which is now Ventas’ largest research and innovation tenant, is replacing Alexion Pharmaceuticals. Alexion paid a termination fee to exit the lease, a move that helped Ventas’ first quarter performance, the company said.Net operating income from its medical and research holdings increased by 3.8 percent in the first quarter year over year.Ventas will begin the rest of its $1.5 billion research and innovation pipeline within the next 15 months, Cafaro said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",77 million development at Arizona St,Despite the senior," housing market still dealing with a surge of new supply, Ventas posted a strong start to 2019 thanks to its investments in other sectors, including medical and research facilities.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/04/26/ventas-investments-in-research-facilities-pay-off-as-senior-housing-market-stalls/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Despite the senior</a> housing market still dealing with a surge of new supply, Ventas posted a strong start to 2019 thanks to its investments in other sectors, including medical and research facilities.","77 million development at Arizona St Chicago, IL","Information Center, Edward H.

A 40-unit row of townhomes at 10509 South Michigan Avenue in Roseland was the sole South Side property to change hands in the sale.Neighborhood Housing Services bought all the properties during the 1990s and built or renovated them with help from a patchwork of federal and local affordable housing tax credits. But as debts mounted over the decades, the buildings faced potential foreclosure before Villa Capital offered to pick them up in a privately-funded purchase, Villa principal Erik Hubbard said.The City Council last year forgave a series of loans the city had extended to NHS, and the nonprofit paid a $2.1 million settlement to the city in return. The agreement also stipulated Villa would buy the units, spend $3 million on building upgrades and keep the apartments affordable to renters who earn roughly half the city’s area median income.The sale comes on the heels of a new report from DePaul University’s Institute of Housing Studies showing a dwindling supply of affordable apartments all over the city, especially on the West Side. The number of affordable units in the Humboldt Park/Garfield Park submarket dropped by 5.3 percent between 2012 and 2017, and the number fell by 6.2 percent in Austin and Belmont Cragin during the same period, according to the report.David Goss of Interra Realty, which brokered the sale, said Villa’s takeover of the properties could help stem some of the forces squeezing low-income renters on the South and West Sides. Villa had already been managing the properties since 2015.“There’s not necessarily a lack of affordable housing in these neighborhoods, so much as there is a lack of quality affordable housing,” Goss said. “So for a respected operator like Villa to come in with a commitment to put money into the properties, to keep them clean and safe all while keeping them affordable, it’s a win-win for everybody.”Hubbard and co-founder John Pagone launched Villa Capital in 2006. The Pilsen-based firm owned or managed more than 2,500 units around the city as recently as 2014, but sold them all starting the following year.In the 14-building crop of NHS-owned apartments, Villa “saw an opportunity to find a core asset that allows us to get back into the game and develop a portfolio,” Hubbard said.Villa plans to raise rents over time, but won’t charge beyond sliding-scale income caps set by the city based each unit’s size and location.“Our investment thesis is that, over the long term, there is a continued need for affordable housing in Chicago,” Hubbard said. “So there will continue to be a supply-demand balance that works for us.”By shedding its multifamily properties, NHS pivots back to its main suite of education, lending and consulting programs for homebuyers.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",3525 West Van Buren Street,Neighborhood Housing, Services of Chicago is cashing out of its apartment ownership business.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/04/25/villa-capital-buys-289-unit-affordable-housing-portfolio/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Neighborhood Housing</a> Services of Chicago is cashing out of its apartment ownership business.","3525 West Van Buren Street Chicago, IL","3525 W Van Buren St, Chicago, IL 60624, USA","(41.875145, -87.71391349999999, 0.0)",41.875145,-87.71391349999999,0.0,2019

The site is zoned for office, research and industrial uses.BP spokesperson Michael Abendhoff said the company expects to maintain the roughly 1,000 employees on the campus. But it has gradually moved hundreds of employees from its Naperville campus to Downtown Chicago over the past decade, most recently in 2016 when it shuffled about 200 jobs to its office at 30 South Wacker Drive, according to Crain’s.The large abandoned corporate campuses include the former GE Healthcare property in Barrington and the former Motorola Solutions headquarters in Schaumburg. But Schaumburg officials are looking at ways to convert the Motorola property into a large mixed-use development, and New Jersey-based Somerset Development is eyeing the former AT&T campus in Hoffman Estates for a similar overhaul.Franklin Partners, meanwhile, bought the former OfficeMax headquarters in Naperville, with plans to revamp the 350,000-square-foot property and lease it in smaller pieces.\xa0[Crain’s] — John O’BrienAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",150 Warrenville Road,BP is looking to," sell a large portion of its Naperville campus, the latest large chunk of suburban office space to be vacated.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/06/29/bp-looking-to-sell-majority-of-sprawling-naperville-campus/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">BP is looking to</a> sell a large portion of its Naperville campus, the latest large chunk of suburban office space to be vacated.","150 Warrenville Road Chicago, IL","150 Warrenville Rd, Naperville, IL 60563, USA","(41.8090413, -88.1506067, 0.0)",41.8090413,-88.1506067,0.0,2018

It’s the chain’s second most-profitable location and is expected to post $123 million in sales this year, according to JLL. Sales are up 5 percent so far this year compared with the same period in 2019, Crain’s reported.The Cook County Assessor’s office valued the property at $46 million. It’s unknown, however, when Neiman Marcus’s lease ends — critical information that will determine how much the buyer will pay for the property. A longer lease will prove more lucrative by giving the owner more time to collect rent.It’s also unclear whether a buyer can tear down the property to develop a new hotel or a residential building, Crain’s reported.UBS bought the Neiman Marcus store and office space in 1998 for $104 million. It wasn’t until 2020 that UBS split up the retail and office space. The offices aren’t on the market,, according to JLL’s listing.Retail on the Mag Mile has suffered during the pandemic. The vacancy rate climbed to 26 percent this year from 15 percent from 2019, Crain’s reported, citing Cushman & Wakefield.

These seven properties and eight others previously belonged to the Rev. Leon Finney’s nonprofit management company Woodlawn Community Development, which filed for bankruptcy in October 2018 amid mounting debt and allegations of fraud.“The city wanted to make sure it could ensure the fate and affordability of the lots, consistent with the fair and equitable development of the neighborhood,” Department of Housing spokesman Don Terry said in an email.When the city approached Community Initiatives about acquiring the interest in the properties, it didn’t specifically mention real estate pressure from the Obama Presidential Center, but “it’s no secret there’s a desire to try to have some influence over the planning process and what’s happening with vacant land in Woodlawn,” director Jonah Hess told Crain’s.Despite its unclear construction timeline, the Obama Presidential Center is already drawn out-of-town investors to nearby neighborhoods, including Woodlawn. This activity is prompting gentrification concerns among housing advocates and residents who worry it will encourage home prices to skyrocket. The Real Deal previously reported that the Obama Presidential Center has attracted multifamily investors from across the U.S. to buy land in Woodlawn.About 30 aldermen support an ordinance that would allow for the creation of a community benefits agreement for the Obama Presidential Center.The auctioned-off properties would become part of the city’s Troubled Buildings Initiative in which turns vacant and abandoned structures into affordable housing.

They said the planned parking lot also doesn’t support the city’s goals to prioritize public transit over personal vehicles.According to city officials, Martin and Community Builders haven’t made the requested changes to their plans or communicated the cause of the delay to residents. One official said Martin, instead, led “an extensive process that was divorced from the reality of what the city would support.”Martin said that while the issue came up before the project was chosen to be considered for tax credits, he thought there would be more wiggle room moving forward.“It’s one thing to share policy preferences; it’s another thing to say, ‘This is not going to happen after a certain point unless X, Y and Z are changed,’” Martin said. “I was not told, especially in writing, prior to the December announcement, that parking was a nonstarter in any way. … I think that this [current design] is a fair compromise.”Housing Commissioner Marisa Novara said the purpose of these affordable housing developments is supposed to be to “reduce parking, increase density and maximize affordability.”[BCC] — Victoria Pruitt\xa0\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",4715 North Western Avenue,Plans for an, affordable housing development in the heart of Lincoln Square have stalled as the developer battles with city officials over parking.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/04/14/affordable-housing-project-in-lincoln-square-delayed-due-to-battle-over-parking/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Plans for an</a> affordable housing development in the heart of Lincoln Square have stalled as the developer battles with city officials over parking.","4715 North Western Avenue Chicago, IL","4715 N Western Ave, Chicago, IL 60625, USA","(41.966865, -87.688619, 0.0)",41.966865,-87.688619,0.0,2022

Walton Street would offer 25 boutique hotel rooms at a time when experts question whether the hospitality market — another booming play for developers — can support the growing number of hotels in the area.Despite energetic downtown development, hotel room prices dropped to an average $259 per night in June, down from $278 in June last year. Occupancy rates also declined 2 percentage points since last year, The Real Deal reported last week.With 13 floors and 25 units, the Harry Weese-designed landmark would be operated by an independent company to offer luxury, corporate suites for extended stays, Crain’s reported.The plans for the hotel are “very preliminary,” Wise, owner and chairman of BRAD Management, told Crain’s.Condo deconversion has become a popular investment choice in Chicago, with rentals in high demand. Deconversion adds the logistical burden of securing approval from three fourths of a building’s current condo owners, but apartment buildings have proved lucrative enough to draw investors, TRD previously reported.

Construction began in July and the project is expected to be completed in the summer of 2024, said Sterling Bay spokeswoman Julie Goudie.The only announced tenant for the building so far is anchor Boston Consulting Group, which closed a deal to occupy about 200,000 square feet. Goudie said Sterling Bay is in advanced talks with other possible tenants. The building will have a total of 490,000 rentable square feet, according to its website.The project is moving forward in a bifurcated office market as downsizing tenants seek newer, amenity-rich buildings. Class A and trophy offices accounted for 90 percent of new leases in the second quarter, according to JLL, with business concentrated in the West Loop. Fulton Market is the fastest-growing urban office market in the U.S.Construction on Sterling Bay’s first multifamily project in Fulton Market is also underway. Along with Denver real estate private equity firm Ascentris, the group landed an $81.8 million construction loan from Chicago-based CIBC Bank USA for a 30-story, 2828-unit apartment building and more than 2,600 square feet of retail space at 160 North Morgan Street.The firm’s biggest ongoing project in Chicago is Lincoln Yards, a 53-acre, $6 billion mixed-use megadevelopment on former industrial land along the North Branch of the Chicago River that will include residential, retail and office space; hotels and restaurants; a life sciences research center; a soccer stadium; a six-acre park and an expansion of The 606 Trail.Sterling Bay’s previous major projects include Google’s headquarters at 1K Fulton, the 159-key Ace Hotel at 311 North Morgan Street, and the 575,000-square-foot McDonald’s global headquarters at 110 North Carpenter Street. The Chicago firm also has a footprint in Miami, with a 298,000-square-foot creative office and retail building in the Wynwood neighborhood.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",360 North Green Street (St,Sterling Bay secured," $206 million of financing for a mixed-use office project in Chicago’s Fulton Market, which it broke ground on earlier this month.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/07/28/sterling-bay-gets-206m-of-financing-for-fulton-market-office-project/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Sterling Bay secured</a> $206 million of financing for a mixed-use office project in Chicago’s Fulton Market, which it broke ground on earlier this month.","360 North Green Street (St Chicago, IL","360 N Green St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8886373, -87.6488244, 0.0)",41.8886373,-87.6488244,0.0,2022

The state announced plans to auction off the 23.4-acre riverfront property back in August.The Chicago-based company plans to demolish the old grain silos, which were declared useless in 2005, and build a new corporate headquarters in its place. MAT’s owner, Michael Tadin Jr., said the property will also include infrastructure that will serve its trucking fleet, which currently operates out of Stockyards Industrial Park in the Back of the Yards and includes waste hauling and construction vehicles.Work to prepare the site will likely take a year before the firm can even start planning the redevelopment, Taldin said.The deal contributes to Gov. J.B. Prtizker’s overall plan to sell off properties in the state’s real estate portfolio that are either too old or too expensive to maintain. In a higher profile deal, it already unloaded a downtown property when Google bought the James R. Thompson Center for $105 million this summer. Officials said they estimate that sale will save taxpayers nearly $1 billion over the course of 30 years in maintenance of the dilapidated building set to be overhauled for the tech firm.The Damen Silos property, located at 2900 South Damen Avenue along the Stevenson Expressway, was previously used to mix road-construction materials for the Illinois Department of Transportation. The almost century-old site was also the backdrop for scenes in the 2014 film “Transformers: Age of Extinction.”MAT also helped develop the 633,000-square-foot Marina Crossings warehouse project in nearby McKinley Park.Minimum bids of $3.25 million for the Damen Silos property were due by Oct. 19 and Illinois’ Central Management Services received four. MAT was selected as the winner with a bid more than double the floor.

(Google Maps)A businessman’s effort to curb eminent domain laws across the country ended Friday when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear his case involving a 15-year lawsuit against Chicago.On the last day of its term, the high court refused to hear Fred Eychaner’s case, which stemmed from the city’s 2005 decision to hand his River West property over to Blommer Chocolate Co.Blommer wanted to expand its candy-making factory and needed Eychaner’s vacant parcel at 460-468 N. Jefferson Street. Blommer had offered $825,000 for the property that at the time was surrounded mostly by former meat-packing warehouses.When the two failed to reach an agreement, the city swept in with its power of eminent domain and seized the property for Blommer, arguing it “may become a blighted area.”Eychaner, who founded Newsweb printing company in Lincoln Park, sued the city in 2006, charging that allegations of speculative decay abused the “public use” requirement.In 2019, he was awarded $7.1 million for the property, which now sits on the edge of bustling Fulton Market. But he wanted the high court to overturn a controversial 2005 ruling, Kelo v. City of New London, that allowed governments to take over property in a push to revitalize an area.Three judges were willing to hear it — Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — but a fourth was needed for it to get on the agenda.In his three-page dissenting opinion, Thomas called the 2005 decision a “mistake” that did a “disservice” to the Constitution. He also noted Chicago “decided to use the coercive power of the government to give the company a valuable parcel of not-yet-blighted-land.”Blommer, whose sweet chocolatey smells have drifted over the city for 80 years, is now owned by Fuji Oil Holdings.

Coppola (Macerich, The Magnificent Mile)Retail landlord Macerich has left Chicago’s Magnificent Mile.Macerich sold its 50 percent stake in The Shops at North Bridge building for $21 million, a fraction of the $515 million that it and partner the Alaska Permanent Fund, paid in 2008, Crain’s reported. The deal was for the 670,000 square foot property at 520 North Michigan Avenue as well as its 50 percent stake in a Wabash Avenue building, bought by the Alaska fund.The transaction could mean the North Bridge building’s owner is underwater on the $375 million mortgage. The sale price may represent only the price for the Wabash parcel, which doesn’t have debt, Crain’s reported. In that scenario, the Alaska fund would have paid nothing for North Bridge itself, as there may be no equity in it with its mortgage.The partnership was still able to extract money from the property since its purchase, even as the Magnificent Mile was hit hard during the pandemic. The partners refinanced in 2016, using some of the money to repay a $189 million loan and keeping the difference, reflecting the mall’s increase in value from 2008.Retailers have been vacating the Mag Mile, including Forever 21, which left 42,000 square feet along North Michigan Avenue before the pandemic. In some cases, landlords are struggling to replace them and building owners have tried to create smaller spaces for retailers. The North Michigan Avenue retail vacancy rate rose to 26 percent in 2021 from 5.3 percent in 2017, Crain’s reported, citing Cushman & Wakefield.New retail tenants are still seeking mall space. Leap, a Chicago startup that provides brick-and-mortar space for e-commerce brands, helped fill first-floor stores recently left empty by Sephora, Lucky Brand and Alex and Ani. The stores, totaling about 8,400 square feet, have been leased to Frank & Oak, United by Blue and Good Life, a Leap spokesman told Crain’s.North Bridge’s occupancy rate was 79.5 percent at the end of 2020, down from 86.3 percent in 2019, Crain’s reported, citing SEC filings.With the sale, Macerich reduced its assets in the Chicago area to just one Rosemont property, the 537,000-square-foot Fashion Outlets of Chicago shopping center, the outlet reported.“It definitely fits within their narrative of reducing urban locations,” Alexander Goldfarb, managing director and senior analyst at Piper Sandler in New York, told Crain’s.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",520 North Michigan Avenue,Retail landlord, Macerich has left Chicago’s Magnificent Mile.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/02/22/macerich-sells-50-stake-in-mag-mile-mall-for-21m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Retail landlord</a> Macerich has left Chicago’s Magnificent Mile.","520 North Michigan Avenue Chicago, IL","520 N Michigan Ave, Chicago, IL 60611, USA","(41.8915257, -87.6248853, 0.0)",41.8915257,-87.6248853,0.0,2022

Two months later, he scaled back his plans to include a seven-story, 72-unit building with ground-floor retail.The Chicago Plan Commission approved the scaled-back plans Thursday.Moyer is also redeveloping the landmark theater itself, planning to spend $70 million to convert the building into a 5,000 capacity entertainment venue, 16,000 square feet of retail, a 50-room hotel and 14 affordable housing units.The troubled concert venue shuttered in 2013 and Moyer bought it in 2015 for $16 million.“It was the wild west over there,” Alderman Joe Moreno (1st) said of the theater’s previous management. “This gem needs a lot of polishing.”The design for the residential building is not yet finalized and is still going through a city review process, city officials said Thursday.The city’s Community Development Commission in June approved using a total of $10.4 million in TIF funds for the overall project, according to reports. The residential building would include 30 percent affordable units and, 80 percent of the retail space will be occupied by locally-owned vendors, Moreno said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2135 North Milwaukee Avenue,Developer Michael, Moyer won city approval Thursday to add a residential building to his planned redevelopment of Logan Square’s Congress Theater.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/12/20/developer-gets-city-ok-to-add-residential-tower-to-congress-theater-redevelopment/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Developer Michael</a> Moyer won city approval Thursday to add a residential building to his planned redevelopment of Logan Square’s Congress Theater.","2135 North Milwaukee Avenue Chicago, IL","2135 N Milwaukee Ave, Chicago, IL 60647, USA","(41.92049009999999, -87.6922488, 0.0)",41.92049009999999,-87.6922488,0.0,2018

The 2.3-acre development will include studio units as well as one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments. There will also be 10 two-story row houses with rooftop terraces along the riverfront. The low-rise apartment building will also have a rooftop terrace on the third floor for its residents.The city’s chief management officer, Alex Alexandrou, compared the project to Chicago’s River North area, and told the outlet that the city was going to be “creative and inventive” about developing the new neighborhood.Windfall Group, which is currently developing the Pacifica Square shopping center on the far East Side, has developments across the country using the Pacifica branding.Pacifica Riverview, at 309 North River Street, is being billed as a transit-oriented development due to the nearby bike trails and its proximity to the transportation center. Because of this designation, the development only has to have 1.5 parking spaces for each unit. Aurora city planner Tracey Vacek said development officials are closely monitoring the downtown parking situation as more developments rise and will likely seek funding for an official parking study in 2023.— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",309 N River Street,Downtown Aurora, could be getting an alluring makeover.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/10/18/windfall-group-gains-support-for-190-unit-resi-development-in-aurora/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Downtown Aurora</a> could be getting an alluring makeover.","309 N River Street Chicago, IL","N River Rd, Chicago, IL, USA","(41.9537822, -87.8566642, 0.0)",41.9537822,-87.8566642,0.0,2022

We saw some lower productivity as we were expanding rather quickly,” Brian Olsavsky said on the call. “We also saw some costs were moving — buying more inventory and moving inventory around in our network to have it be closer to customers.”Chicago’s industrial sector has been particularly hot, with developers showing no inclination to slow down. Some 18 projects totaling 4.7 million square feet of industrial space came online in the second quarter, according to a report from Colliers International. That’s the most new space delivered in a single quarter since the end of 2017. The same report found that more than 12 million square feet of space would be delivered by the end of the year.Since 2013, 227 speculative industrial projects totaling 61 million square feet have been delivered. More than 68 percent of that space has been leased.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",3639 Howard Street,It sure looks like, Amazon has inked one of the biggest industrial deals in Edens corridor this year.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/09/04/amazon-with-an-insatiable-appetite-for-warehouse-space-appears-to-make-big-play-in-skokie/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">It sure looks like</a> Amazon has inked one of the biggest industrial deals in Edens corridor this year.","3639 Howard Street Chicago, IL","3639 Howard St, Skokie, IL 60076, USA","(42.0161206, -87.7190427, 0.0)",42.0161206,-87.7190427,0.0,2019

It’s owned by a retired couple, the investor Tom Harter and his wife Brenda, who planned to move to Florida after living in Naperville for more than 40 years, according to published reports. Lauren Dayton with Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty is the listing agent on the property.Jameson Sotheby’s Lauren Dayton (Sotheby’s International)Lauren Dayton with Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty is the listing agent on the property.It’s likely among the suburb’s most expensive single-family listings ever. Last fall, a 15,450-square-foot home on Van Buren Avenue near downtown Naperville was listed for just below $15 million. At the time, that was more than double the next-highest county listing of just below $7 million.In August, DuPage County’s priciest home sales ranged from $2.5 million for a newly-constructed six-bedroom to $4 million for a five-bedroom built in 1922 that last sold for $3.2 million in 2020, with most in the western suburb of Hinsdale.The Van Buren Avenue listing was removed in May. Both properties spent months on the market despite a surge in high-end buyers in the Chicago area this year.Midway through the year, 55 homes in Chicago had sold for $4 million or more in 2022, and have since surpassed last year’s record 101 homes that met that threshold. This year’s figure has at least 113 to set a new all-time high.Still, it’s possible that growing fears of a recession could rattle buyers and sellers, slowing an overheated real estate market. Plus, the single-family homes that command eight-figure prices in the Chicago area are concentrated on the North Shore’s suburbs, much closer to or on Lake Michigan’s shoreline.Yet one nearby high-end sale at a price well above much of the rest of the area’s luxury market closed earlier this year in an off-market deal in the western suburbs. In Hinsdale, the estate of Frederick Krehbiel, the late electronics company founder and nephew of a former White Sox owner, sold an 11,000-square-foot home for $7.5 million in a May.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1112 Shamrock Court,After more than a," year of being shopped, one of Naperville’s priciest home listings of all time hasn’t budged on its ask, even after coming off the market for more than two months and returning.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/10/19/naperville-mansion-back-on-the-market-for-10-5m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">After more than a</a> year of being shopped, one of Naperville’s priciest home listings of all time hasn’t budged on its ask, even after coming off the market for more than two months and returning.","1112 Shamrock Court Chicago, IL","Shamrock Ct, Lisle Township, IL 60540, USA","(41.7550598, -88.0964952, 0.0)",41.7550598,-88.0964952,0.0,2022

Now, the Los Angeles-based mall owner has hired JLL to market the property at 1610 Deerfield Road, whose 50,000-square-foot Toys R Us store closed two years ago after the retailer went bankrupt, Crain’s reported. The mall is now 64 percent vacant.A new developer could demolish the existing buildings on the 7.6-acre property and construct up to 381 residential units, according to Crain’s, citing JLL’s marketing material.Balboa was formed in 2011 and has acquired over 3 million square feet of retail assets across 18 states, according to its website.The move comes at a time when retail continues to get pummeled. A new report from Coresight Research showed as many as 25,000 retail stores may close this year because of the pandemic, with a majority closing in shopping malls. That number would dwarf the prior record of 9,800 retail closures set in 2019, according to the report. Already, 15 national retailers have elected not to pay May’s rent, according to a separate report from Datex Property Solutions. And Macerich, which owns 47 shopping malls across the U.S., said it collected about 25 percent of rent owed by tenants in April, and a similar number as of mid-May.Simon Property Group, the nation’s largest mall owner, sued The Gap earlier this month for $66 million in unpaid rent across its properties and this week exited a $3.6 billion deal to acquire mall operator Taubman.Locally, Simon also skipped its $1.3 million May payment on the $257 million mortgage for Gurnee Mills mall; and a KKR venture with Pacific Retail Capital Partners missed its $333,000 payment on a $107 million mortgage for Yorktown Center mall.

Both it and a 7,100-square-foot Gap Kids location at 1740 North Sheffield Avenue will not reopen, according to the outlet.The pandemic has pummeled the already wounded retailer. In April, the Gap stopped paying rent on its more than 2,700 stores under various brands nationwide. Brookfield has been among the landlords that have sued the Gap for non-payment of rent. In July, the Gap responded, arguing in a lawsuit filed in Cook County Court that its leases with Brookfield should be modified or terminated. The Gap claimed coronavirus-related restrictions made the core purpose of those leases “illegal, impossible, and impracticable.” The retailer has used a similar argument with other landlords.In late October, Gap Inc. announced it would be exiting malls and closing 350 of its stores — 220 of its namesake Gap shops, and 130 Banana Republic outposts — by early 2024. The company has said 80 percent of its remaining stores will be in off-mall locations. The move came as the Gap has attempted to reinvent itself, focusing predominantly on outlets and e-commerce.Macy’s has followed a similar playbook. The recent decision to shutter its 170,000-square-foot store at Water Tower Place was months in the making. Macy’s is also moving to smaller stores along with larger fulfillment centers for online shoppers.In addition to the two locations that will not reopen, the Gap previously announced it would shutter its 28,000-square-foot store at 555 North Michigan Avenue, also along the Mag Mile. That will close later this month, Crain’s reported.A spokesperson for the company said it was “looking thoughtfully at our real estate to support the best path forward.” [Crain’s] — Alexi FriedmanAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1740 North Sheffield Avenue,The Gap will," permanently close its store at Water Tower Place on the Magnificent Mile, with the announcement coming days after Macy’s said it would exit its flagship location at the same Brookfield Property Partners-owned mall.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/01/08/gap-will-exit-brookfields-water-tower-place-joining-macys/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Gap will</a> permanently close its store at Water Tower Place on the Magnificent Mile, with the announcement coming days after Macy’s said it would exit its flagship location at the same Brookfield Property Partners-owned mall.","1740 North Sheffield Avenue Chicago, IL","1740 N Sheffield Ave, Chicago, IL 60614, USA","(41.9128557, -87.65385309999999, 0.0)",41.9128557,-87.65385309999999,0.0,2021

The business is currently overseen by Chicago Blackhawks Chairman Rocky Wirtz and includes real estate holdings on Chicago’s North Side, the United Center and an office tower in New East Side.With occupancies and rents on the rise for suburban apartments, owners have been able to sell similar properties for sizable profits.The portfolio sale, which hasn’t officially closed yet, was a rare opportunity for an investor to buy a lot of properties within a small area in a single transaction.The properties included in the sale are a 41-unit building at 605-617 Hinman Avenue, a 39-unit property at 1000-1010 Hinman Avenue, a 40-unit building at 800-810 Michigan Avenue, an 18-unit property at 929-935 Michigan Avenue and a 26-unit building at 910-916 Judson Avenue.North Park plans to invest a total of $42.2 million in the properties, including renovations. It plans to put about $1.1 million in equity into the buildings and raise $10 million through CrowdStreet, a crowdfunding platform hired to seek investors for the deal. North Park will borrow about $31.1 million for the rest of the capital.North Park, which specializes in buying multifamily properties in need of renovations to improve them and increase rents, owns more than 1,100 apartments in and around the Chicago metro.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",16 Judson and 1000-10 Hinman Ave,"The Wirtz family,"," which hasn’t sold any property in recent memory, is selling its entire apartment portfolio in Evanston.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/04/wirtz-family-sells-entire-evanston-apartment-portfolio-for-35m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Wirtz family,</a> which hasn’t sold any property in recent memory, is selling its entire apartment portfolio in Evanston.","16 Judson and 1000-10 Hinman Ave Chicago, IL","1000-10 Hinman Ave, Evanston, IL 60202, USA","(42.0360336, -87.67875629999999, 0.0)",42.0360336,-87.67875629999999,0.0,2022

This will save a three-bedroom 2,750-square-foot unit about $9,600 a year. Homeowners in the building such as Michael Rosenblub, who is also a Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices KoenigRubloff Realty Group agent, told Crain’s he’s hoping “this could jump-start sales” with the six listings he has at the building units he represents.Units in the building, which has $28 million in reserves, have sat stale on the market. Crain’s found that 12 condos at the building at 835 North Michigan Ave. which sold this year spent an average of 202 days on the market.With the exception of some pricey new condo towers, it has been a tough year for the residential market. Home sales earlier this year fell by almost 10 percent in the Chicago metro area and fell by 13 percent in Chicago itself, according to the RE/MAX Chicago Housing Report.But it hasn’t been all that bad for the Mag Mile condo building. Earlier this year, co-founder of Vivid Seats Eric Vassilatos wanted to combine six units in the tower to assemble a 14,000-square-foot luxury condo. This is similar to what Oprah did in the 1990s with her 9,600-square-foot space from four condos in the building. She sold it in 2015 to Centaur Interiors in 2015 and have sold off the units for a combined total of over $10 million.

About 60 percent is used by Morningstar, setting the landlord up for a test amid the health crisisMorningstar “always undertakes a rigorous real estate evaluation process when we approach the end of an office lease term,” spokeswoman Stephanie Lerdall told Crain’s in a statement. “For our space in Chicago, our evaluation of options—including our existing location—includes criteria we believe is essential to developing the Morningstar employee experience of the future.” She said the “evaluation is not yet complete.”A shift to Marshall Field would be a win for Brookfield Properties, the Toronto-based developer that Crain’s says has renovated parts of the landmark building into offices.The Marshall Field building last month landed online admission ticket broker Vivid Seats as a tenant across 48,000 square feet on the ninth floor, TRD reported.A move would also be a positive sign for downtown properties, where commercial vacancies have surged amid the pandemic and the transition to remote work.Morningstar has also considered moving to Fulton Market and anchoring a new project in an area that has defied the city’s record vacancies by gaining tenant commitments over the last year, Crain’s reported.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",37 building at 22 Washington Street,Morningstar may be, on the move in Chicago.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/02/10/morningstar-looking-at-move-from-block-37-to-marshall-field-building/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Morningstar may be</a> on the move in Chicago.","37 building at 22 Washington Street Chicago, IL","22 W Washington St, Chicago, IL 60602, USA","(41.8833404, -87.62872109999999, 0.0)",41.8833404,-87.62872109999999,0.0,2022

The move comes two months after parent company Starwood Capital Group lost control of a seven-property regional mall portfolio.The Chicago property is the nearly 1 million-square-foot Louis Joliet Mall. Starwood last made a payment on its $85 million CMBS loan in March, and is over 90 days past due. The loan went into special servicing in May.According to the latest report from Trepp, Chicago-based Starwood Retail is in negotiations for a deed in lieu of foreclosure or a foreclosure sale.It has been a rough couple of years for the Joliet Mall, which is about 40 miles southwest of Chicago. One of its anchors, Carson’s, closed in 2018 and a year later, the Sears there shut down. The 40-year-old mall’s surviving anchor retailers, JCPenney and Macy’s, are facing severe problems of their own.The mall was last appraised at $131.8 million in 2012, when Starwood Retail acquired it and the Chicago Ridge Mall as part of a larger deal. Barclays provided the $85 million loan in 2012, records show.The Joliet Mall loan is part of CMBX 6, a mortgage derivative index that is heavily exposed to debt tied to retail and mall loans. It has become a popular way for investors such as Carl Icahn to short regional shopping malls.Starwood declined to comment through a spokesperson.As the pandemic has stretched into months, more owners have sought to give up on struggling malls, especially those with CMBS debt that is tricky to restructure because of covenants the servicers have with bondholders. Brookfield Properties is seeking to hand over the keys on a $90 million CMBS loan on its mall in Florence, Kentucky, while Namdar Realty has requested a deed in lieu of foreclosure for a $33 million loan backing a mall in Saginaw Township, Michigan, according to Trepp.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1 Hotels)St,Starwood Retail," Partners is giving up on one of its suburban Chicago malls, handing over the keys to its lender after first defaulting on a loan payment in the spring.

Chicago’s retail vacancy rate has been rising and chains like Sears and Barneys have felt the blow.Barneys New York had a Gold Coast location one block north of the now-closed Marc Jacobs store. But when the franchise filed for bankruptcy in August last year, the store closed its doors as well.The closing of Marc Jacobs leaves 2,700 square foot of retail space up for grabs on the ground floor of the Waldorf Astoria in Chicago. Some are optimistic about filling the space such as Chris Conlon, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Acadia Realty Trust. Conlon told Crain’s that his firm has experienced “robust” interest in the location from other retailers.“The Rush and Walton intersection has really emerged over the past three to five years to be a dominant retail quadrant within the Gold Coast,” he said to Crain’s. “It’s been endorsed by a lot of great domestic and international retailers that perform very well.”His firm paid $44 million in 2014 for the retail space in the Waldorf.

News of the New York firm’s plan to buy the 40-story building from Manulife John Hancock for $310 million surfaced in September.The deal on the 36-year-old tower officially closed last week, according to Cook County records.Roughly 70 percent of the Blackstone loan went to the acquisition, with the remaining 30 percent — $93 million — earmarked for improvements, said 601W Principal Mark Karasick.The building is nearly 25 percent vacant, well above the average vacancy rate for Downtown and up from nearly 15 percent when Manulife bought it in 2015.“We’ve got a lot of leasing to do,” he said.601W plans a number of changes to tenant amenities, including an updated lounge and conference center. The biggest and most expensive project will be replacing the tinted glass that is part of the Helmut Jahn-designed facade, which Karasick said would likely be unpopular with potential tenants.“We’re going to make it more light-friendly,” he added.601W has embarked on similar facelifts at other Chicago properties, including Prudential Plaza, which it sold earlier this year to Chicago developer Sterling Bay for $680 million.601W is also in the middle of a $185 million overhaul at the Aon Center that includes plans for an exterior elevator and observatory.Its biggest reclamation project in Chicago is the ongoing conversion of the hulking, long-vacant Old Main Post Office into 2.8 million square feet of new office space.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1 South Wacker Drive,601W Companies," secured a $310 million loan for its acquisition and planned overhaul of 1 South Wacker, The Real Deal has learned.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/12/18/601w-companies-lands-310m-loan-for-1-south-wacker-purchase-renovation/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">601W Companies</a> secured a $310 million loan for its acquisition and planned overhaul of 1 South Wacker, The Real Deal has learned.","1 South Wacker Drive Chicago, IL","One South Wacker, 1 S Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL 60606, USA","(41.8815195, -87.635987, 0.0)",41.8815195,-87.635987,0.0,2018

The buyer is a wealthy Swiss investor whose name hasn’t been disclosed in public records.Dean’s company bought the building in 2015 for $14.5 million, the same year that Google opened its Midwest headquarters and set off a wave of commercial redevelopment that sent property values soaring in the former meatpacking district. Metonic didn’t respond to a request for comment.The six-story property includes 40 surface-level parking spaces, providing its new owner potential to redevelop the asset and add rentable space.The Swiss buyer paid $357 per square foot, only a bit more than a Spanish investor paid to the northeast of Fulton Market. That investor, whose identity has similarly been shielded from public records, paid $14.4 million, or $351 per square foot, in a sale-leaseback of the office lofts at 311 West Walton Street occupied by marketing firm AgencyEA, in the Near North Side.The Fulton Market building isn’t fully occupied like the Near North Side building. A listing shows a space slightly larger than 10,000 square feet is available for lease, giving the Swiss investor a chance to land a tenant and generate more rental revenue than the property yields now.The Jefferson Street building was built in 1938 and was well-known as the Schwinn Bicycle Company headquarters, with the company using the name Arnold, Schwinn, & Co. at the time, according to the lease listing.Keely Polczynski and Blake Johnson of CBRE represented Metonic in the sale.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",217 North Jefferson Street,A foreign buyer paid," more than $350 per square foot for Chicago loft offices in Fulton Market, the second time this summer that an overseas investor hit that mark.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/08/swiss-buyer-drops-21m-on-fulton-market-offices/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A foreign buyer paid</a> more than $350 per square foot for Chicago loft offices in Fulton Market, the second time this summer that an overseas investor hit that mark.","217 North Jefferson Street Chicago, IL","217 N Jefferson St, Chicago, IL 60661, USA","(41.886343, -87.6424273, 0.0)",41.886343,-87.6424273,0.0,2022

The Art Van store had occupied the 71,400-square-foot building built in 1996, just east of a Target in the same shopping center.It’s the latest example of a Chicago-area big box building landing leases with legacy retailers that have been consolidating their real estate for years and changing their business models to match them to smaller spaces. Earlier this month, Macy’s leased to refill a former Carson’s that closed in 2020 in a two-story, 120,000-square-foot store in the southern suburb of Evergreen Park.It’s unclear whether Kohl’s is taking the entire building or a portion. A CBRE commercial leasing team was marketing the former Art Van space as potentially divisible into three 24,000-square-foot blocks. Neither Kohl’s nor Hubbard Street returned requests for comment.Hubbard Street’s purchase of the property in December marked its latest slide in value. Arizona’s STORE Capital had paid $12.3 million for it before Art Van closed and terminated its lease, which had about 17 years remaining as of 2019, according to a former LoopNet listing marketing the property for sale.The Schaumburg shopping strip also hosts a Dollar Tree and International Fresh Market and has Raising Cane’s chicken and Jersey Mike’s sandwich restaurants in outlot buildings.

Wabash Avenue (Credit: Google Maps; CMK)One of Chicago’s most active developers just snagged a development site in the South Loop for just under $6 million.CMK Companies purchased a parking lot at 1400 S. Wabash Avenue from American Landmark Properties last month, according to Crain’s. American Landmark Properties received approval four years ago to construct a 296-unit apartment building on the property.The lot sits across the street from CMK’s 261-unit apartment building on S. Wabash, called the Coeval.It’s unclear why American Landmark Properties never developed the property. The company purchased the lot for $5.8 million in 2017 and commissioned Lucien Lagrange to create a design.Similarly, it’s unclear what CMK plans to do with the site, though the developer has built scores of rental projects across the city, according to Crain’s.With a recession likely, such projects will test the abilities of developers. Lenders were more than eager to provide loans for apartment towers during the boom years. That likely won’t be the case in the years to come.\xa0 [Crain’s] — James KleimannAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1400 S.

It includes five private terraces, direct elevator access to a private on-floor lobby, and features both city and lake views, a theater room, a wine cellar, and amenities such as a humidor room, a screening room, a spa and year-round pool, maid and room service, and a four-car private garage.25 East Superior Street (Zillow)The 52-story Fordham Building at 25 East Superior Street was completed in 2003 and in River North. The listing is a rarity in the building, where other units for sale range from $385,000 to $2.7 million. Tim Salm with Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty is representing the listing and did not respond to a request for comment.It’s been a complicated time to sell and buy condos in Chicago. Two of the priciest sales to ever happen in the metro — the $20.6 penthouse sale at the St. Regis and the $20 million penthouse sale at Trump Tower — have shown the strength at the top of the condo market. But overall condo sales have lagged behind single-family home sales in a year where the pandemic has delayed return to office plans and more buyers are seeking larger spaces.The St. Regis sale closed last week — showing the strength at the top of the Chicago market even as a likely recession looms. Rising interest rates don’t hit buyers in this segment of the market often because they rarely borrow for their acquisitions nd instead pay cash.The listing joins 27 other publicly listed condos at about $7 million or above in Chicago. At the top of the market there are several major listings, including two condos at Park Tower listed by Ken Griffin at $15 million and $13.5 million, and at the Waldorf Astoria one condo is seeking $15 million and another is asking $12.5 million.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",25 East Superior Street,A penthouse in River, North is seeking nearly $7 million in a market that’s been challenging for some — but not all — condos across Chicago.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/09/26/river-north-penthouse-seeks-7-million/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A penthouse in River</a> North is seeking nearly $7 million in a market that’s been challenging for some — but not all — condos across Chicago.","25 East Superior Street Chicago, IL","25 E Superior St, Chicago, IL 60611, USA","(41.8954074, -87.6272288, 0.0)",41.8954074,-87.6272288,0.0,2022

The 5,700-square-foot condo has four bedrooms, five bathrooms and two balconies.The sale follows a slew of recently closed deals at the tower, including one at $6 million and two at almost $9 million each. It’s also the third priciest sale in Chicao this year, only bested by the $20 million sale at the Trump International Hotel & Tower and a $17.4 million sale at No. 9 Walton.Laura England, an agent with Compass, represented the buyers, who are not yet identified in public records.“What I loved about it is that it’s lakeshore east, it’s this really cool pocket that is kind of hidden and tucked away, but close to everything,” England said.The privacy and views attracted the buyers, who England said initially considered the building for several investment property units. She said the price tag didn’t include finishes and estimates the buyers will move in after another year of construction finishing the apartment.The sale is the 55th in the Chicago area at or above $4 million this year. The pace of luxury home sales would put 2022 ahead of 2021, when a record-setting 101 homes sold in the same price range.The buyers put the property under contract in January 2021. Leila Zammatta of Magellan Realty represented the developer.Formerly the Wanda Vista Tower, the St. Regis Chicago is a 101-story tower completed in 2020. Located at 363 E Wacker Dr, it is the city’s third tallest building. The building’s chief architect is Jeanne Gang, head of Studio Gang Architects.The St. Regis has some competition within the luxury new development market. Tribune Tower and One Chicago are both closing deals on units as all three projects are near completion and delivery of units to buyers.England said the St. Regis and Tribune Tower offer buyers two dramatically different options at the top of the market, with the St. Regis offering something sleek and modern, while the Tribune building is steeped in history and in the heart of the city.Several other major sales should be coming to the tower soon. The tower’s agent has 11 units listed as “pending” on public listing sites, including three units over $10 million — one of which, listed at $18.5 million — would be among the priciest sales in Chicago this year, should it close at that price.Contact Miranda Davis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n Condo sale tops $6M at Chicago’s St. Regis \n St. Regis condo sells for almost $9M \n Latest St. Regis condo sale is highest priced yetAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",363 E Wacker Dr,A $9.2 million sale, at the St. Regis tower is the highest priced deal to close at the development and the third-highest sale this year in the Chicago area.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/06/14/priciest-chicago-st-regis-sale-top-9m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A $9.2 million sale</a> at the St. Regis tower is the highest priced deal to close at the development and the third-highest sale this year in the Chicago area.","363 E Wacker Dr Chicago, IL","363 E Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL 60601, USA","(41.8874508, -87.61745979999999, 0.0)",41.8874508,-87.61745979999999,0.0,2022

And the $12.5 million loan on the three-story property at 240 N. Ashland Avenue recently transferred to a Miami-based special servicer, according to Crain’s.Denny, whose company Peppercorn owns about 25 properties in the West Loop and the city’s Near West Side, told Crain’s that he wasn’t worried about losing the property to a default.But if tenants at several other properties don’t pay rent in the next few months, he’ll face a serious cash crunch. “We’re preparing for a situation where the demand is so much less that it might be a challenge to carry the buildings for a prolonged period of time,” Denny, who has embraced the moniker “The King of the West Loop,” told the outlet. “That, in my opinion, warranted getting to know the special servicer and getting their opinion.”Denny’s situation could be a preview of what’s to come for many owners of commercial property in Chicago, as the economic shutdown continues to depress rental collection rates, while mortgage payments pile up, and the prospect of finding new tenants remains slim.Peppercorn bought the building in 2008 for $13 million and took a $12.5 million loan out in 2015, which was bundled with other loans as part of a commercial mortgage-backed security. Denny tried to sell the property in 2018 as an Opportunity Zone play, but found no takers.

It came on the market for $4.75 million in October and was under contract within 62 days, Crain’s reported.On average, houses priced at $2 million or more take a year to sell in the Barrington area, according to Redfin. A 22,000-square-foot mansion has languished on the market since it was priced at $17 million in September 2007.The last time a home in the area sold for at least $4 million was in March 2019, when a 20,500-square-foot house went for nearly $4.5 million about five years after it was initially listed.Other suburban luxury markets have had a hard time unloading mansions, as potential buyers move toward the downsizing and luxury inventory in Downtown Chicago.Michael Jordan’s massive compound in Highland Park, for example, still hasn’t sold since he first listed it in 2012. Since then, the price has been reduced from $29 million to nearly $15 million.In Burr Ridge, the asking price for a 30,000-square-foot-plus house once listed for $25 million has dropped to $5 million since it was relisted for nearly $11 million in 2016.

All eight buildings are scheduled to be completed by September.A Redfin listing advertises a three-bedroom, 3,100-square-foot condo at 1370 West Walton for $829,900.“This is a very special project to us because we believe that Noble Square is the next upcoming neighborhood,” Lisek wrote in an email. “We see this neighborhood becoming the next ‘hot neighborhood to be in.’”The $87 million mortgage from LoanCorp Capital is nearly seven times the nearly $13 million in total estimated construction costs registered in buildings department records for the eight properties. Lisek did not comment on what the loan proceeds will be used for.The site is one block from the Augusta Avenue exit off the expressway. It sits about a half-mile each from the Division CTA Blue Line station in Wicker Park and the Chicago station in River West.The new condos will face competition from Stas Development, which is converting the St. Boniface Catholic Church into condos one block south at 1358 West Chestnut Street.Noah lists a portfolio of nearly 100 single-family homes and 50 multifamily properties scattered across the city’s Northwest Side, especially in the Wicker Park and Ukrainian Village neighborhoods.

The pitch: early investors have the most to gain.The approach paid off for the Chicago firm, which started investing in the neighborhood in 2004. Its newest condominium project, 72 four-bedroom luxury townhomes at 311 S. Racine Avenue, sold even before construction was completed, demonstrating the area’s resilience, according to Belgravia CEO Jon McCulloch.It’s an anomaly in Chicago’s overall condo market, where units sit on the market longer and sell for lower prices than single-family homes. The West Loop is different: Home to tech companies like Google, it’s attracting both residents and commercial tenants. Some 9,000 West Loop apartments have been proposed or are in the planning stages, although rising rates may scupper some of them.Many potential buyers in the area are young families looking for larger homes, McCulloch said. The condos range from 2,160 to 3,157 square feet and have either three or four bedrooms, and include 12 four-bedroom penthouses with rooftop terraces – up from five based on demand. Prices range from $850,000 to $2.1 million. The four-bedroom condos are performing so well that the company’s next project, CAX, will have both four- and five-bedroom floor plans.Because Belgravia is offering high-end homes that aren’t priced at the top of the market, the company has had to be creative about where it builds. “When you’re kind of in more of the high mid-market space you have to find ways to push boundaries,” he said, choosing locations outside the typical boundaries of a neighborhood.McCulloch said Belgravia is evaluating where to turn next and is scouting locations on the fringe of the West Loop where they expect development to follow.The almost-completed S. Racine project, dubbed CA6, is the sixth condominium project the firm has completed in the area. Belgravia expects the first residents to move in this summer.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",311 S.

Now you get inquiries all the time.”Chicago office broker Matt Pistorio got his groove back on Goose Island right before the pandemic. He’s spent the past three years as a principal at developer R2 Companies, telling anyone who will listen that he can help turn the gritty industrial area once known as “Little Hell” into a thriving, diverse neighborhood.“You’d have to beg for people to go over there,” said Pistorio, who joined R2 from the brokerage Telos Group, which he co-founded in 2012. “Now you get inquiries about Goose Island all the time.”Debates have raged for decades over whether the factories and warehouses on the 160-acre landmass on the Chicago River should be replaced by multifamily housing for the wealthier people who started trickling to the city’s Near North Side in the 1980s.Now, more than three decades after then-Mayor Richard Daley pushed through its zoning as a Planned Manufacturing District, the city is about to find out whether the artificial island has outgrown that designation.Several big projects are poised to transform its southern tip. Canadian developer Onni Group is close to breaking ground on thousands of apartments that will be walking distance to River West, where Bally’s is building a $1.6 billion casino and entertainment complex.Chicago’s biggest industrial real estate players are also circling, pouring almost $200 million into the island where FedEx and Amazon and candy maker Mars, with its made-in-Chicago Wrigley’s brand, have hubs. About half that investment came from Prologis, the nation’s largest owner of industrial real estate, which bought a 340,000-square-foot warehouse at 930 West Evergreen Avenue. The property is fully leased to a logistics venture of Related Companies and Greenfield Partners, as well as a division of Mars, which broke ground this year on a $40 million research and development facility adjacent to its offices.“You have access to all the major neighborhoods and you’re close to Interstate 90,” said Jason St. John, founding partner of Greenstone Partners, a commercial brokerage whose headquarters is on the island. “That’s why Prologis did what they did with buying this site. Goose Island is a prime example of last-mile logistics, super-urban infill real estate.”Proximity to the highway doesn’t necessarily mean easy access, though. Once considered a shortcut for both north-south and east-west drivers via Halsted and Division streets, respectively, some motorists avoid Goose Island altogether due to bottlenecks. The island lacks an “L” train station, leaving public transportation to city buses that refuel on the cracked pavement of a weedy North Branch parking lot. Amenities are also scarce: There are no bars and the island’s single restaurant is the 49-year-old Goose Island Shrimp House.Goose Island is an odd place, typically associated more with the beer brand bearing its name than the island itself, which was created by William Ogden in the 1850s when he dug a canal that gave a stretch of the Chicago River a second branch and separated the island from Old Town, Cabrini-Green and the rest of the Near North Side.Named for the waterfowl kept by Irish immigrants, it was the site of power plants, a train yard and grain elevators, and began losing the residents who worked at its factories at the end of the 19th century.But its long-established industrial vibe is starting to change. R2 is turning the former Morton Salt Shed property into a 4,000-seat live performance venue. On an August evening, music from performers tuning up for a nighttime show wafted through the streets, softening the fading sun that illuminated its brick industrial structures.Workers still flowed through the streets as shifts changed at Mars, FedEx and Amazon, and the island’s recent deals are nothing if not industrial. James Martell’s Logistics Property Company paid $55 million for vacant land at 1237 West Division Street, a site just across the river that, like the Salt Shed, is referred to as “Goose Island-ish.” The developer plans the city’s first two-story warehouse on the site, a 600,000-square-foot facility.Much of the development is being driven by R2, a specialist in adaptive reuse of aging industrial buildings whose CEO, Matt Garrison, said in 2015 that he’d buy the entire island if he could. The firm has transformed properties such as 1315 North Branch Street into creative office lofts that were fully leased during the pandemic as many other Chicago buildings lost tenants and, according to Pistorio, still attract employees for in-person work. Citywide, the number of workers in offices last month was just 40 percent of pre-pandemic levels, Kastle Systems data show.The island’s industrial roots won’t disappear any time soon, even as developers march onward with plans to use old buildings for other commercial uses and try to erect new ones. It’s an approach that Pistorio said will distinguish the island’s evolution from projects such as Lincoln Yards and The 78, where Sterling Bay and Related Midwest are trying to build entirely new neighborhoods from the ground up.“It will be an eclectic mix of industrial, office and retail, which sets it up to make it a really interesting district. It will be unique. It won’t be contrived. It will be an authentic neighborhood,” Pistorio said.“It’s not a foregone conclusion”R2 is far from the only — or biggest — real estate player to have moved in on the isolated neighborhood. Houston’s Hines, which bought 1315 North Branch from R2 this year for $47 million, plans to redevelop a one-story structure into a 275,000-square-foot, six-story timber office building at Division and Cherry streets. Dubbed T3, Hines hasn’t inked a pre-lease, blaming pandemic interruptions. Reused existing buildings, by contrast, have scored deals because they’re cheaper than ground-up developments and can offer lower rents than in hot spots like Fulton Market.Not all have succeeded. The 180,000-square-foot former home of culinary school Kendall College, Goose Island’s most visible building from its southern end and a candidate for adaptive reuse, sits vacant. Kendall bought out the rest of its lease , which had options to extend through 2028, from owner W.P. Carey Group following the school’s 2019 move to Michigan Avenue.Even brokers like Colliers’ Mike Senner, who’s marketing a development site owned by Lakeview Realty that could become 77,000 square feet of office and light industrial space, isn’t sold on the island’s future as an office hub — even though it could lift the value of Lakeview’s nearby properties.“It’s not a foregone conclusion,” Senner said.Rising rents for industrial real estate and the growing need for last-mile logistics space diminish the reward associated with converting more old buildings into offices, Senner said. R2 might have made just as much money flipping 1315 North Branch without turning it into offices, and could have instead “hung gas unit heaters, sealed the floors and leased it to industrial users,” he said.Optimists say real estate and infrastructure projects will help the island’s transformation. While it’s unlikely to host upscale eateries such as the Restaurant Row establishments on Randolph Street close to Fulton Market workers, at least one is coming.Hogsalt Hospitality, which runs high-end restaurants in Chicago and New York, is working with R2 to redevelop a building and vacant land along the river known as the Goose Island Boatyard. They hope to turn the 3.5-acre former boat storage facility into an entertainment and dining destination. The city, meantime, aims to expand Division across Goose Island into a four-lane road, which may relieve traffic.Hines, led in Chicago by Will Renner and Brian Atkinson, insists there’s no need for tenants to demand easy access to retail, saying the rise of food delivery services puts a variety of options at the other end of a cell phone. They also noted that Crate & Barrel’s sister company, CB2, moved to 1315 North Branch from Fulton Market three years ago.“It’s easy to get to. It’s low-friction office space,” Renner said.For all that, Hines hasn’t put a whole lot of resources toward getting T3 off the ground. It hasn’t bought the property: Instead, it struck a deal with the family that owns it to build if it draws an office tenant, allowing Hines to sit out the project until the market improves. Hines said interest from prospective tenants has picked up this year.Pistorio remains on the hunt for opportunities, even as he acknowledges that ground-up success will be limited. He struck an agreement with W.P. Carey, the owner of the former Kendall College building, to handle leasing and plans to bring it to market soon.“You have incredible ceiling heights, and goofy spaces with garage doors — it’s not traditional office,” Pistorio said, before using a metaphor to differentiate adapted spaces from typical modern offices.“If you have a bunch of suburban tuna cans on Goose Island, it’s probably not leasing right now.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",930 West Evergreen Avenue,Chicago office," broker Matt Pistorio got his groove back on Goose Island right before the pandemic.

It bought them from the Comforte family, whose late patriarch, Victor Comforte, started Chicago’s Climatemp heating and cooling business in 1950 and ran it for decades from Fulton Market.Separately, Trammell Crow paid $23.4 million to a venture of Shapack — an early pioneer of Fulton Market — for a property at 1150 West Carroll. Less is known about the buyer’s plans for the site than the former Comforte property next door.Fulton Market property values have surged since it became a high-end office hub providing tenants an alternative to the Loop and riverfront towers. The development wave was spurred in large part by Google and McDonald’s decisions to put their workplaces in the neighborhood last decade, as the fast-food chain moved its headquarters from the suburbs. Since then, developers such as Shapack — who this spring explored a sale of 167 North Green, which could crush Chicago’s per square foot sales record if it’s bought — have turned the former meatpacking district into a live-work-play destination, adding luxury hotels to the area as well.Trammell isn’t new to the neighborhood, either. It built the life sciences lab-oriented Fulton Labs project, a pair of buildings at 400 North Aberdeen and 1375 West Fulton streets that, combined, hold more than 700,000 square feet of rentable offices and labs.The Texas firm last year gained city approval for a 410-foot, 26-story mixed-use office and commercial building at the May Street parcel, which will contain 180 parking spaces and 650,000 square feet of offices, along with 15,000 square feet of ground-floor retail. To the north at 1112 Carroll, Trammell is moving toward breaking ground on a 370-foot tall, 33-story residential building with 377 units, 90 parking spaces and ground-floor commercial space.The $550 million project was initially conceived as two office towers. Then Trammell converted the building on 1112 West Carroll to residential use after Chicago’s Plan Commission allowed such developments north of Lake Street last year.Immediately to the west, at 1150 West Carroll, Shapack is more than doubling an investment he made three years ago with his sale to Trammell, public records show. He bought the property, which includes a 37,000-square-foot industrial building on a 43,000-square-foot lot, for $11.3 million.How Trammell plans to use the property it bought from Shapack and when it might make a proposal to redevelop it are unclear.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",315 North May Street,Trammell Crow," dropped $100 million on Fulton Market development sites where it’s had two towers in the works for more than a year and to set up its next project, handing a profit to Jeff Shapack, one of the neighborhood’s biggest real estate players.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/15/shapack-cashes-in-as-trammell-crow-drops-100m-in-fulton-market/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Trammell Crow</a> dropped $100 million on Fulton Market development sites where it’s had two towers in the works for more than a year and to set up its next project, handing a profit to Jeff Shapack, one of the neighborhood’s biggest real estate players.","315 North May Street Chicago, IL","315 N May St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8872301, -87.65507459999999, 0.0)",41.8872301,-87.65507459999999,0.0,2022

It came after 101 houses selling for at least that price last year, almost double the 51 that hit that mark in 2019.Smith and his wife, Denise Matthews-Smith, bought their seven-bedroom home on Starr Lane in Winnetka for $3.55 million in 2014. Smith, who retired in July after a 30-year career with the aerospace company, served as interim CEO after Boeing fired Dennis Muilenberg in 2019 after two 737 Max planes crashed, killing 346.Single-family home values rose 11.6% in November from the year-earlier month, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices report cited by Crain’s. That continues a streak of double digit increases that started in June. It’s the third-longest such streak dating back to the 1980s. The longest ended in August 2006.The figures show how much low interest rates and pandemic-era shifts in housing needs have bolstered the market. In the 12 months before the onset of the pandemic, Chicago-area home prices never rose more than 2 percent in a month. In the preceding five months, the increase was less than 1 percent, according to Crain’s.Nationwide, home prices rose 18.8% in November, after four months when the figure was over 19%. The series of double-digit increases kicked in earlier nationwide than in Chicago, Crain’s reported.Chicago’s price growth remained near the bottom of the list of major U.S. metropolitan areas, where it has been for much of the past four years. Only in two of the top 20 biggest metro areas did prices rise more slowly than Chicago: Washington, D.C., at 11 percent and Minneapolis, at 11.2 percent.[Crain’s] – Harrison ConneryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1045 Starr Lane,Chicago’s luxury, residential market is off to a strong start to the year.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/01/26/new-year-same-hot-luxury-residential-market-in-chicago/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Chicago’s luxury</a> residential market is off to a strong start to the year.","1045 Starr Lane Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2022

The couple bought the unit as raw space when the historic former hotel building was converted to condos in the 2000s and embarked on a two-and-a-half-year buildout resulting in an ultra-sleek, modernist interior, said listing agent Mark Icuss of Compass.“It’s one of the most striking homes I’ve ever been in,” he said. “While modern, it’s very warm.”One of two penthouse units in the Ambassador West, the Taner’s 6,000-square-foot home has five bedrooms, five bathrooms, a 1,000-square-foot outdoor terrace and a custom spiral staircase covered in Vienetian plaster. Three parking spots in a heated garage are included with the unit. The listing went live on Wednesday.Britt Taner handled the interior design — she owns a design firm, according to a feature on the pop-art-adorned home in Luxe. Her husband, Kerim Taner, owns an investment firm. The unit was lightly lived in, Icuss said, as the couple spends time between multiple other properties.If the unit trades at its near-$8 million asking price, it would be the second priciest home sale of the year, trailing only an $11.3 million buy in No. 9 Walton. Icuss said the sale could be one of the top three priciest sales of the year, depending on how listings like the $13.5 million unit at 840 North Lake Shore Drive fare on the current market.After a banner year for the luxury market in 2018, this year’s market has slowed considerably with sales of $1 million or more dropping 22 percent year over year. The drop is even more pronounced in the Downtown condo market.The popularity of new high-end developments like JDL Development’s No. 9 Walton and Related Midwest’s One Bennett Park have hurt the market for older luxury condo units, market experts have previously told The Real Deal.While some luxury condo listings are languishing, Icuss said the owners’ extensive renovation of the unit will be of benefit to the listing, as it will require no overhauling by a new owner.The Ambassador’s other penthouse sold previously for $7 million, but it required a multimillion-dollar rehab, Icuss said.“It definitely stands out against a lot of old, dated condo inventory out there,” Icuss said. “There’s a market for a product that is turn-key, move-in ready.

No asking price is listed for the property, which totals 646,000 square feet of buildings developed in the 1970s.Like other companies long headquartered in suburban Chicago, Baxter wants to modernize its workplace to keep employees interested in coming into offices after working from home during the pandemic. Many of the company’s employees have chosen hybrid work schedules consisting of some days in the office and some working from home, a spokesman for the company told Crain’s.The move to sell the property marks the latest large swath of corporate offices in the Chicago suburbs to hit the market with loads of redevelopment potential. Last year, Allstate put its 232-acre headquarters in Northbrook on the market and made a $232 million deal to sell it to Nevada industrial developer Dermody Properties. That company plans to demolish the office buildings and build 3.2 million square feet of warehousing.JLL is also emphasizing the redevelopment prospects of Baxter’s property. Industrial developers are increasingly on the hunt for land since rents in that sector have exploded in the Chicago area and across the nation.Suburban Chicago offices, meanwhile, have been falling out of favor for years, and have been prevented from recovering by the pandemic.Suburban office vacancies sit at a record-high of 26 percent with 25 million square feet of unleased space across the suburbs, according to the brokerage Cresa.

But like many other older suburban homes, it had a hard time moving in today’s housing market.“The feedback was it’s such a special house, but there were areas that were just not considered’ in previous renovations, McCurry said.After the home failed to find a buyer, homeowners Susan Shipper-Smith and Ted Smith decided to pull the listing and continue renovating it, including upgrading the bedrooms, McCurry said.“Once you vacate a property, all the blemishes come out,” he said. “They took it off and prepared it for the market.”The Avery Coonley Playhouse was constructed in 1912 as a schoolhouse. The name “playhouse” comes from the school’s mission of education through theater and other performing arts; its grand hall contained a stage.Industrialist Avery Coonley and wife Queene Ferry Avery had the school built on their estate, which featured a mansion designed by Wright and other structures. When the family moved to Washington, D.C. in 1917, the playhouse was turned into a mansion.Turning the school into a home has been a work in progress ever since, McCurry said. The current owners have labored for years to make it more livable, including turning what was essentially a storage area into a family room.The home contained some of the Wright’s most celebrated window designs, including school-appropriate stained-glass balloons, confetti and flags. Many of the original windows were sold off, with some hanging in museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The Smiths have worked to replace this windows with reworkings of the Wright designs.“The replacements are museum-grade, too,” McCurry said. “They sought out the best makers they could.”Despite the renovations, the home hits the market this week with a $50,000 price cut over its previous listing, and is now asking $750,000. Accepting price cuts is not uncommon in the higher-end suburban market, which is dealing with an abundance of inventory and a lack of younger buyers, who are putting off buying or choosing to live in the city.Not even historic homes are spared. The Wright-designed home on the Coonley estate sold in February for $1.2 million, after eight years on the market and an original listing price of $2.9 million, Crain’s reported at the time. In early 2018, a Glencoe home designed by Wright sold for $752,000 after being listed at $800,000.Despite the slumping market, McCurry said the playhouse should fare well. Most available homes don’t have the history and significance of the Smiths’ listing, he said.“It shows really well now,” McCurry said. “A buyer will be able to own a piece of history, and also be able to live there.”The listing went live on a private network Wednesday and will hit the MLS by Friday, he said..All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",350 Fairbank Road,A Frank Lloyd," Wright-designed schoolhouse-turned-mansion is returning to the market, this time with a price cut and some newly finished renovations.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/07/24/frank-lloyd-wright-designed-school-turned-mansion-returns-to-market/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A Frank Lloyd</a> Wright-designed schoolhouse-turned-mansion is returning to the market, this time with a price cut and some newly finished renovations.","350 Fairbank Road Chicago, IL","350 Fairbank Rd, Riverside, IL 60546, USA","(41.8192432, -87.8283032, 0.0)",41.8192432,-87.8283032,0.0,2019

12:49 PM",There’s a gold rush in Chicago’s Bronzeville neighborhood.,"[""4559 S Prairie Ave (Zillow)There’s a gold rush in Chicago’s Bronzeville neighborhood.More new houses sold in the South Side community, a historically significant area for the city’s Black community, than any other neighborhood last year, Crain’s reported. That’s due to an influx of residents looking for affordability they can’t find elsewhere without sacrificing access to the city’s downtown and lakefront.But the way in which the neighborhood is gentrifying may not push out many current residents and could become a model for other areas.“It’s one of the last places in Chicago where you can get a new, 4,000-square-foot house for under $1 million,” Michaela Gordon, an @properties agent who sold a new, 3,600-square-foot house for $815,000 on 42nd Street in December, told Crain’s. “It has a variety of quintessential old Chicago architecture, and you’re not displacing anyone.”The median home price in Bronzeville last year was over $550,000, Crain’s reported, citing Chicago Association of Realtors data. That’s higher than some North Side neighborhoods like Avondale and Portage Park. The city-wide median is $318,000.What makes Bronzeville’s transition different from other places in Chicago where gentrification displaced longtime residents, such as Pilsen and the 606 trail area, is that the neighborhood has thousands of vacant lots caused by years of disinvestment, according to Crain’s. Developers who once viewed them as eyesores that depressed home values in the area are now rushing to develop them. That’s lifting the area’s housing and income profile without driving residents away.Bronzeville had more than 3,000 vacant lots at the start of the century. Many of those have been redeveloped since 2017, with more than 250 houses sold for $500,000 or more, according to Crain’s.The pandemic may be helping homes sell in the neighborhood, which has been slow to attract amenities like the restaurants and cafes that usually pop up in a hot housing market.“You don’t expect to walk down the street for coffee, for dinner,” Sheila Dantzler, a Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty agent, told Crain’s. “You expect to be home, in your house or in your yard.”More high-end development is on the way. A set of five homes priced in the $950,000-range will come on the market later this year. Coldwell Banker Paulette Edwards, who has experience selling homes in Bronzeville, told Crain’s she is “absolutely confident” the demand is there.With prices rising so quickly, some prospective buyers are already priced out of the neighborhood. Dantzler said Fuller Park, to Bronzeville’s west, could be the next place to attract affordable new development.“A lot of people who could afford Bronzeville two years ago at $600,000 can’t afford it now at over $700,000,” Dantzler told Crain’s. “The prices have gone up so high in a short time frame.”\n“Read\n\n\n\nMixed use development to bring housing and retail to Bronzeville\nBronzeville investors hope to capitalize on megaproject at Michael Reese site\nBrothers decide against Bronzeville deconversion[Crain’s] – Harrison ConneryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",4559 S Prairie Ave,There’s a gold rush, in Chicago’s Bronzeville neighborhood.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/01/19/why-bronzevilles-gentrification-may-become-a-model-for-other-chicago-neighborhoods/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">There’s a gold rush</a> in Chicago’s Bronzeville neighborhood.","4559 S Prairie Ave Chicago, IL","4559 S Prairie Ave, Chicago, IL 60653, USA","(41.811305, -87.61921, 0.0)",41.811305,-87.61921,0.0,2022

DePaul College Prep, which has an alliance with DePaul University, relocated last year to a new 17-acre campus in nearby Roscoe Village.The development, which connects to the Riverview Bridge adjacent to the new DePaul College Prep campus, also includes 391 parking spaces and 3,000 square feet of retail space.The report also noted the plans come ahead of a new law that will raise the numbers of affordable housing units developers will be required to include in apartment projects that goes into effect Oct. 1.

Fulton St. (Loopnet)Fulton Street Cos. is living up to its name.The Chicago developer is buying four loft office buildings in the Fulton Market neighborhood for $34 million, its fifth project in the area, according to Crain’s. The seller is Woodbury, N.Y.-based CLK Properties.Fulton Street earlier this month unveiled plans for a 1.5-million-square-foot mixed-use project along the 1200 block of West Fulton, with offices, lab space and a large gym. It’s also finishing work on a 150,000-square-foot building at 1045 W. Fulton St., preparing to break ground on a 34-story building at 1201 W. Fulton St. and recently sold a redeveloped property at 1100 W. Fulton St.Fulton Street Founder and CEO Alex Najem has a personal connection to the four loft properties, totaling 77,000 square feet: he worked at Cedar Street, another Chicago developer, when it sold the buildings at Aberdeen and Fulton streets to the CLK venture in 2015. The property also includes a surface parking lot.The buildings today have a mix of small tenants and blocks of vacant space, giving Fulton Street some in-place revenue as well as an opportunity to lease up or reposition the properties with new types of uses, according to Crain’s.CLK’s local portfolio is mostly made up of residential properties. It purchased three of the office buildings from CLK in a $27 million portfolio deal with Cedar Street in April 2015 and the fourth for $7.7 million in December of that year, according to Crain’s, citing Cook County records and data from research firm Real Capital Analytics.[Crain’s] – Harrison ConneryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1101 W.

Michigan Avenue in Downtown ChicagoGoldman Sachs has pulled funding from Chicago’s largest active condominium project, the $470 million tower at 1000 S. Michigan Avenue.The construction lender has put the 74-story tower on ice until it assesses the real estate market’s strength in September, the Chicago Tribune reported.The bank is “concerned about economic stability of the market at this particular time due to recent events,” said Francis Greenburger, whose firm Time Equities is co-developing the Helmut Jahn-designed tower alongside New York-based JK Equities and Oak Capitals.In June, Crain’s reported that construction work on 1000M’s foundation had stopped, apparently the first high-rise to fall victim to the economic uncertainty caused by Covid-19. The developers issued a statement at the time that claimed construction had stopped due to safety concerns, not financial issues.Goldman Sachs covered the cost of the first phase of the foundation but hasn’t released funds to continue working, Greenburger told the Tribune. It’s unclear how much has been spent on the 840-foot tower, though the developers are exploring other means of financing the construction before the September review.Greenburger told the Tribune that 101 of 421 units were in contract, with buyers having put 10 percent down. Those buyers are being offered half of their deposits back, though Greenburger told the newspaper that many declined.Several other notable projects in Chicago have been delayed because of Covid-19, which has sent Chicago’s unemployment rate soaring. At least 450,000 workers in the Chicago metro area have lost their jobs in the last year, according to statistics from the Illinois Bureau of Labor. Construction of Uber’s office space in the Old Post Office development has been delayed, as has the planned observatory at the Aon Center.Greenburger and his partners bought the condo site for $17.2 million in 2016. Some of the units were reconfigured last year into micro-units to spur sales. Prices range from $476,000 for studios to $8.5 million for the penthouse.

01:15 PM","When insurance brokerage Aon Corporation moved its global corporate headquarters from Chicago to London in 2012, it was seen as a “symbolic blow” to the city’s office market.","[""Aon Center (Google Maps)When insurance brokerage Aon Corporation moved its global corporate headquarters from Chicago to London in 2012, it was seen as a “symbolic blow” to the city’s office market.But Aon would keep its American headquarters at 200 East Randolph Street, and retain naming rights for the 83-story office tower known as the Aon Center. The building, Chicago’s third tallest, is also the headquarters for major companies like commercial brokerage JLL, public relations firm Edelman, and food conglomerate Kraft Heinz.New York-based 601W Companies bought the tower from Piedmont Office Realty Trust for $713 million in 2015, and received approval for an $185 million overhaul of the property in 2018 — including plans for a “thrill ride” on the observation deck that will dangle passengers over the edge of the roof in a glass-bottomed enclosure.Months before the Chicago Plan Commission approved that renovation, 601W secured a $678 million refinancing of the property, of which $400 million was securitized in a single-asset CMBS transaction named JPMCC 2018-AON. Documents associated with that deal provide an inside look at the tower’s finances.As of May 2018, the 1.75 million-square-foot property was 88 percent leased to 52 tenants, with five of the top 10 using the building as either their global or American headquarters.Aon is still the top tenant with 15 percent of rentable space, while big four accounting firm KPMG is the second with more than 300,000 square feet. KPMG first moved to the Aon Center in 2009, and has since expanded its lease several times — most recently adding a floor for a big data-centric “Ignition Center” in 2019. The fifth-largest tenant, Edelman, was reported last year to be in talks to leave Aon Center for Sterling Bay’s 111 North Canal Street, but that deal did not close.On average, tenants at the Aon Center pay base rent in the low $20s per square foot. The priciest major lease at the building is for insurance company Kemper Corporation, which moved its headquarters to the property in 2018 and pays about $25 per square foot.Occupancy at the tower has risen above 90 percent since the refinancing, as insurance company Health Care Services Corporation inked a 65,000-square-foot lease across two floors in early 2019.601W, led by Michael Silberberg and Mark Karasick, is also the owner of the Old Post Office building which opened its doors to tenants last fall, following two decades out of service and an $800 million overhaul.The company recently pulled off the biggest single-asset acquisition since the pandemic began, paying $952.5 million for SL Green’s 410 Tenth Avenue, an Amazon-anchored office building in Manhattan’s Hudson Yards neighborhood. The hefty price tag was widely viewed as a positive signal for New York’s investment sales market, which has had a dearth of deals in recent months.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",200 East Randolph Street,When insurance," brokerage Aon Corporation moved its global corporate headquarters from Chicago to London in 2012, it was seen as a “symbolic blow” to the city’s office market.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2020/11/11/heres-what-tenants-pay-at-601w-cos-aon-center/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">When insurance</a> brokerage Aon Corporation moved its global corporate headquarters from Chicago to London in 2012, it was seen as a “symbolic blow” to the city’s office market.","200 East Randolph Street Chicago, IL","200 E Randolph St, Chicago, IL 60601, USA","(41.884798, -87.62124589999999, 0.0)",41.884798,-87.62124589999999,0.0,2020

12:27 PM","Chicago’s two-, three- and four-flat buildings are dwindling amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and with it renters are losing a staple of the city’s affordable housing market.","[""(iStock)Chicago’s two-, three- and four-flat buildings are dwindling amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and with it renters are losing a staple of the city’s affordable housing market.A recent study from the American Bar Foundation and the University of Illinois Chicago found that some smaller building landlords — who had previously been flexible and accommodating for renters struggling to make ends meet — were tightening rental requirements or considering selling their buildings altogether, the Chicago Tribune reports.The study found that independently-owned rental properties make up a substantial portion of the non-subsidized affordable housing market in the city. Historically, those landlords have accommodated tenants by limiting rent increases and offering flexibility on late payments, according to the study.The researchers interviewed 51 Chicago landlords with small properties. Ten of those interviewed said they would raise rents and further screen tenants.“When landlords take these shifts to more rigid approaches, they end up passing the risks of this crisis, the financial crisis, onto tenants,” researcher Allison Suppan Helmuth told the Chicago Tribune.The most recent report matches a 2021 study from the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University that showed Chicago’s two-, three- and four-flats were disappearing and are typically replaced with a single-family residence or an empty lot, not additional rental housing, according to the Tribune.“This sector of the rental market is really important because: one, it is more affordable, and two, there’s an understanding, somewhat supported by previous research, that landlords have these more flexible, lenient, tenant-friendly practices in this sector,” researcher Anna Reosti said.Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, a nonprofit homeownership organization, is concerned with the study’s findings. The organization has been partnering with other community organizations to preserve and renovate two- and four-flats across Chicago.Experts recommend formalizing a lease, which can help both tenants and landlords. Landlords told the researchers clearer guidance about rental assistance and stronger mortgage protections would have helped, the study found.[Chicago Tribune] — Miranda DavisContact Miranda Davis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n Chicago finances mixed-use affordable housing project led by nonprofit for blind \n City to buy largest vacant land in Pilsen, provide 280+ affordable housing units \n Developers plan mixed-income complex in Chicago’s BronzevilleAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2021 study from the Institute for Housing St,"Chicago’s two-,"," three- and four-flat buildings are dwindling amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and with it renters are losing a staple of the city’s affordable housing market.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/03/07/chicago-is-losing-its-two-three-and-four-flat-rental-buildings-adding-to-affordable-housing-shortage/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Chicago’s two-,</a> three- and four-flat buildings are dwindling amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and with it renters are losing a staple of the city’s affordable housing market.","2021 study from the Institute for Housing St Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2022

Latsko said he has been working with the city’s Committee on Design on a plan for the building to rise nearly 40 stories. It will include more than 500 apartment units “with loads of green space,” Latsko said.It’s another glass high-rise planned for Fulton Market, a neighborhood with a fast-growing office supply that has experienced a surge in its residential development in the pipeline of late. Latsko initially pitched his project as a 33-story office tower but pivoted to apartments amid the pandemic.The Guinness brewery and taproom is projected to open by St. Patrick’s Day of next year. It follows the Irish beer company’s first location stateside in Maryland. The business signed a multi-year lease for the 15,000-square-foot space, which Latsko also owns.The project’s apartment units add to the West Loop’s residential development boom. The area had more than 9,000 units planned or under construction – more than the rest of downtown Chicago neighborhoods combined – as of March. Much of that development is in Fulton Market, where both apartments and offices are in demand.27th Ward Alderman Walter Burnett’s decision to lift a ban on residential zoning in Fulton Market in April 2021 preceded many of those proposals.Another recently announced project for Fulton Market is emerging developer Joy Jordan’s 17-story mixed-use tower on Sangamon Street, a glass and metal-paneled building that will include office and retail space. That project will be located directly across from the Guinness brewery.Construction on Sterling Bay’s first multifamily project in Fulton Market is also underway at 160 North Morgan Street, where the firm is building a 30-story, 282-unit apartment and more than 2,600 square feet of retail space. The firm cited Fulton Market’s pipeline of incoming corporate headquarters and the need for more multifamily options for a young, modern workforce as the factors that supported the project.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",375 North Morgan Street,Chicago developer, Fred Latsko unveiled a rendering of the apartment tower on tap to accompany the nation’s second Guinness brewery planned for Fulton Market.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/09/20/376100/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Chicago developer</a> Fred Latsko unveiled a rendering of the apartment tower on tap to accompany the nation’s second Guinness brewery planned for Fulton Market.","375 North Morgan Street Chicago, IL","375 N Morgan St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8888452, -87.65209999999999, 0.0)",41.8888452,-87.65209999999999,0.0,2022

Vi will move from its current location at Irvine Company’s 71 South Wacker Drive to the skyscraper at 233 South Wacker Drive early next year.The new lease comes as Blackstone Group continues work on its $668 million redevelopment of the historic Chicago skyscraper. New amenities in the building will include a 30,000-square-foot fitness center, a cafe and lounge on the 33rd floor and a food hall. The building’s renovated lobby was unveiled to the public this week.Vi Chief Financial Officer Gary Smith said in a statement the Willis Tower improvements will help the firm recruit and retain employees.“The building, as well as the highly desired Loop location, is exactly what we were looking for in our new space,” he said.The new lease continues a hot streak for Blackstone, which bought the Willis Tower for $1.3 billion in 2015, the most expensive office transaction outside of New York City.Earlier this year, United Airlines announced it would remain at the Willis Tower until at least 2023. Taking more than 850,000-square-feet in the tower, United is the largest single-space, private office tenant in the city.In December, electronics manufacturer Molex inked a 20,000-square-foot lease in the Willis Tower, bringing its occupancy to 94 percent.

The other unit, which has been on the market since January with an asking price of $5.65 million, didn’t retain many of the historical details and essentially got a new interior entirely.The 16,000-square-foot home was built by Emily Ryerson and her three children after they fled the Titanic in a lifeboat while traveling home for the funeral of another son, a Yale student who had been killed in a car accident. Her husband, Arthur Ryerson, was among about 1,500 people who lost their lives.The Ryerson mansion is one of several Georgian row homes that Adler and Dangler designed near the 2700 North Lakeview Avenue property.The mansion, which hasn’t been a residential property since 1946, housed the addiction recovery and mental health facility Thresholds since 1975.While most of the interior had been divided into small, dormitory-style rooms and the living room had been used as a basketball court, many features survived years of rough living.[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","2700 North Lakeview Avenue (Encyclopedia Titanica, VHT St",Let’s hope the buyer, doesn’t have a sinking feeling.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/12/15/condo-in-titanic-survivors-mansion-hits-market-for-almost-8m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Let’s hope the buyer</a> doesn’t have a sinking feeling.","2700 North Lakeview Avenue (Encyclopedia Titanica, VHT St Chicago, IL","2700 N Lakeview Ave, Chicago, IL 60614, USA","(41.93139679999999, -87.6398188, 0.0)",41.93139679999999,-87.6398188,0.0,2021

The affordable units will cost about $52 million.“The tax savings help to partially offset the cost of the affordable component of the project, making it possible to provide these units, but by no means results in a financial windfall,” said Liz Butler, the zoning attorney for the project.Mayor Lori Lightfoot introduced the tax ordinance, the first to give tax incentives to developers building multi-family projects in “low-affordability communities” or areas where 40 percent or less of the total housing units are affordable. A 2019 analysis found that only 20 percent of housing in the O’Hare area is affordable for households earning 60 percent of the local median income.Approval of the Glenstar project broke the city’s longstanding tradition of letting the local alderperson have final say over developments in their wards. Alderman Anthony Napolitano, whose district includes the area, wanted to build a commercial development instead. He denied that he opposed the project because of the affordable housing.At a committee meeting before the City Council, Napolitano said the decision to approve the development against his wishes tells residents that their voices won’t be heard. Mayor Lightfoot says housing is at the heart of the city’s segregation and the new development will help workers at O’Hare Airport.“This is a time to not just think about your own interests; it’s time to think about the city’s interests,” Lightfoot said. “It’s critical for us to make a statement about affordability and where it can be located.”[BCC] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",8723 West Higgins Road,Glenstar Properties, scored a $23.5 million tax break on a 297-unit project near just east of O’Hare Airport that was approved this year after it was first presented in 2016.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/05/10/glenstar-scores-24m-tax-break-for-ohare-affordable-housing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Glenstar Properties</a> scored a $23.5 million tax break on a 297-unit project near just east of O’Hare Airport that was approved this year after it was first presented in 2016.","8723 West Higgins Road Chicago, IL","8723 W Higgins Rd, Park Ridge, IL 60068, USA","(41.9870469, -87.8445251, 0.0)",41.9870469,-87.8445251,0.0,2022

The building opened last year.At the time it opened last summer, Vista on the Park was one of few ground-up apartment developments to take shape in rapidly-gentrifying Humboldt Park, where home prices have skyrocketed since 2017. The building’s paneled design and rooftop amenities mimic the parade of new high-end apartment developments rising along the Milwaukee Avenue corridor to the east and north.Each unit also includes a private balcony and in-unit laundry, according to Kyle Stengle, senior director of Marcus & Millichap’s multifamily and mixed-use group. The amenities, combined with more spacious apartments than are found in most comparable new apartment buildings, helped fill the building within months of its opening, he said.The building includes one- and two-bedroom apartments measuring between 875 and 1,310 square feet, with rents ranging from $1,931 to $3,605 per month.Senne paid $915,000 in 2015 to buy the property from investor Neil Freeman, according to Cook County property records. Two years later, while construction was underway on the six-story residential complex, Senne secured a $7.7 million loan on the property from Park Ridge Community Bank.In order to bring the development in line with the city’s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, Senne also built a small apartment building with a trio of three-bedroom units at 1411 North Fairfield Avenue, about a half-mile away. Those apartments rent at $1,270 per month and are being marketed for sale together with the North Avenue property, according to the brochure.The site lies inside the city’s Milwaukee affordability pilot zone, where any new residential proposal needs to set aside 15 percent of its units as affordable in order to secure zoning approval. Since Senne began construction before the pilot zone went into effect in November 2017, his proposal did not trigger the requirements.Stengle and Austin Weisenbeck of Marcus & Millichap also brokered the sale of Senne’s Maynard mixed-use building at 2934 North Milwaukee Avenue in 2015. CLK Properties ultimately bought that property for $6.1 million in 2015, property records show.In both cases, the breadth of banks willing to offer financing at relatively low interest rates presented a “good opportunity to sell the asset,” Stengle said.Vista on the Park is about two blocks east of the 207-acre Humboldt Park and two blocks south of the 606 Trail, where property values have spiked especially hard. Local Alderman Roberto Maldonado (26th) recently introduced a series of ordinances to downzone properties near the trail as a way of slowing the frenzy of new development, but the measures reportedly stalled in the City Council on Wednesday.Senne did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2635 West North Avenue,Broker-developer, Bill Senne is ready to cash out on a new mixed-use complex he completed in Humboldt Park last year.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/07/24/humboldt-park-apartment-mid-rise-listed-for-15m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Broker-developer</a> Bill Senne is ready to cash out on a new mixed-use complex he completed in Humboldt Park last year.","2635 West North Avenue Chicago, IL","2635 W North Ave, Chicago, IL 60647, USA","(41.9101065, -87.6935661, 0.0)",41.9101065,-87.6935661,0.0,2019

Onan appears to be the seller based on prior reporting in the Lake County News-Sun. A news release about the deal stating that Kiser Group’s senior director Matt Halper and director Danny Mantis represented the seller did not identify Onan.“The unique thing about this deal is it’s a bulk condo deal rather than the far more common condo deconversion,” Halper said in a statement.Though condo deconversions have been on the upswing since 2015, steadily transforming much of Illinois’ condo stock into rentals, the owner of the majority of the units did not want to market the sale as a deconversion despite owning more than the 75 percent required under state law, according to Kiser.All of the units included in the sale are currently rented to tenants, giving the property an in-place cap rate of 6.3 percent, the brokerage said.Mantis cited the strength of the far north suburban market and said the area has been seeing strong investor interest from outside Waukegan in recent years.“The buyer of this property comes into a situation with several options,” he said in a statement. “They will have the opportunity to continue to operate the condo chunk as the seller has and organically raise rents and also will have the opportunity to acquire additional units over time.”The condo building is among the newest housing stock in the area.Joseph Rominski, an attorney representing Onan, told the Lake County News-Sun in May the condo units had been slow to sell a decade ago so the Onan family began renting them out. Onan reportedly found a buyer for the 58 units last year, but a conditional use permit not allowing the rental of units caused the sale to be delayed.Some individual condo owners in the building objected to allowing the units to be rented, fearing that the building would become an all-rental community and displace owners if the property was sold.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",3370 West Brooke Avenue,The developer of a, Waukegan condo building sold more than three-quarters of the building’s units for $4.1 million.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/09/09/developer-jim-onan-sells-waukegan-condos-in-4m-bulk-sale/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The developer of a</a> Waukegan condo building sold more than three-quarters of the building’s units for $4.1 million.","3370 West Brooke Avenue Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2022

The global restaurant chain finalized its corporate relocation to Fulton Market from suburban Oak Brook earlier this year.Companies with suburban headquarters like Caterpillar, Sears Holding Corp. and Allstate have all launched satellite offices Downtown as a way to interest a younger demographic of employees who have increasingly moved back into the city.Demand for Downtown office space has risen sharply this decade, jumping from an average of $31.69 per square foot in 2010 to $39.41 this year, according to commercial real estate firm CBRE.McDonald’s and Google’s new corporate offices in Fulton Market have inspired hundreds of millions of dollars in office development in the West Loop, as other businesses look to follow their lead.Last month, Shapack Partners leased furniture manufacturer Knoll to three floors inside the developer’s new 70,000-square-foot office building at 811 West Fulton Street.And more recently, Mark Goodman & Associates unveiled a proposal for a 12-story office building around the corner from the Google and McDonald’s offices.And prolific Fulton Market Developer Sterling Bay plans 1.7 million square feet of new office space in four new buildings on Green and Morgan Streets.Chicago remains in the running for Amazon’s HQ2, which could bring up to 50,000 high-skilled tech jobs wherever it lands.

It showed yet more evidence of Cook County’s rapidly-falling stock of apartments that are affordable to middle- and low-income renters — a trend driven in large part by a purge of walk-up rental buildings.But it also found a decline in high-income renters, a sharp reversal from previous years and an apparent rebuke of everything real estate pros say they’ve noticed about the city’s demographic and economic shifts.For the first time in at least a decade, the county saw a decline in the number of renter households that earn more than 120 percent of area median income, or about $82,000. The number fell from 187,230 in 2016 to 170,381 in 2017, the last year analyzed, a decline of roughly 9 percent.The number of high-income renters is still far above where it was before the 2008 housing crisis, which drove tens of thousands of Chicago-area residents all across the income spectrum away from homeownership. But the 2017 data could show that trend is finally starting to turn, with a slight increase in the number of owner-occupied households across the county. That figure had steadily dropped from 2007 to 2015.“We’re seeing a shift in the demographic groups that have been key drivers of rental demand during the recovery, which is high-income renters and millennials,” said Sarah Duda, deputy director of the institute and the study’s lead author. “Higher-income households have a lot more choice, and they’re more mobile, so they may be taking that opportunity to switch to homeownership.”The report used Census data and other public records to calculate renter demand. In addition to the reduction in high-income renters, it also showed a decline in renters age 55 and younger, with an especially sharp drop in the 25-34 age group.Duda cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from a single year’s results, saying the loss of younger and well-to-do renters would only “raise an alert” if it spills over into future years.But the shift “doesn’t surprise” Charlton Hamer, senior vice president of affordable housing developer The Habitat Companies.“Going back to the late aughts, we’ve seen this increase in the younger, educated population graduating from Big Ten schools and then gravitating toward Chicago,” Hamer said. “But as that group gets older, a lot of them are either buying infill single-family homes [in the city] or moving to inner-ring suburbs.”Another factor could be that younger well-to-do renters are simply doubling up and sharing higher-end apartments, reducing the number of rental households even while the number of actual renters continues to rise, according to Aaron Galvin, CEO of Luxury Living, which handles leasing for a number of high-end properties.“We’re seeing more couples renting a lot of the one-bedrooms in these newer buildings, which tend to have smaller unit sizes,” Galvin said. “So these apartments are getting smaller, but still commanding a high price point.”And if the city is seeing a dip in demand among big-spending renters, no one told the landlords who keep hiking rents, Galvin added. Rents are approaching $4 per square foot, and one-bedrooms are event renting for $3,000 in some newer buildings, after four years in which a combined 20,000 high-end apartments were added near the city core, according to data compiled by Luxury Living.Nearly half of Luxury Living’s clients come from outside the city, mirroring a heavy influx of coastal residents being drawn Downtown by high-salary jobs.Other luxury apartment brokers are seeing demand grow, too. Downtown Apartment Company, the rental division of Downtown Realty Company, saw a 22 percent hike in closings during the first quarter this year compared to 2018, managing broker Ben Creamer said. That followed a 13 percent rise between 2017 and 2018.“We’re maybe seeing an uptick on the buyer side with some older millennials, but I think rental demand is as strong as it’s ever been,” Creamer said.He added the growing glut of high-end apartments, especially around the South Loop with new developments like Essex on the Park and NEMA Chicago, is pushing luxury management companies and offer generous concessions in some parts of the city.The incentives may be strong enough to keep a major slice of well-do-to residents out of the buying market.And luxury resi brokers like Janice Corley, owner of RE/MAX Premier, have noticed. The suddenly wide availability of high-rise rentals is luring away many older spenders who would otherwise be looking for houses, Corley said.“It seems like baby boomers all decided to sell their [suburban] homes at the same time” and flock to ritzy Downtown apartments, Corley said. “And now that millennials are getting married and having kids, they’re not replacing the boomers. They’re staying in the city.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",111 West Maple Street,The DePaul," University Institute for Housing Studies’ recent State of Rental Housing report confirmed bleak, if unsurprising, trends from the past several years.

That will let the Chicago-based developer raze the existing taxi stand and build a drive-thru restaurant in its place. It would be the chain’s third location in the city. The bulk of the 90,000-square-foot site will be dedicated to a 128-vehicle parking lot. The plan was first presented during a public meeting in November.The entire project is set to cost around $15 million, according to GW principal Mitch Goltz. The restaurant will be built with a “prohibition-style” brick facade, evoking early 20th-century Chicago architecture, Goltz said. GW Properties has yet to purchase the land, and it still needs the Zoning Board of Appeals to approve a special-use permit for a drive-thru. Goltz said he hopes to complete the building in time for the restaurant to open by the end 2019.The site is in the alderman’s ward, meaning the project requires his consent to move forward.

He recently revealed an updated design of an apartment tower of more than 500 units at Fulton Market’s 375 North Morgan Street that will rise on the western portion of on the site of the Guinness brewery and taproom that’s being built.Pamela Rueve and Michael Mandera of Jameson Sotheby’s International Realty were the listing agents for the house. The buyer has not been identified yet. Latkso said the house took a long time to sell. He first listed it in 2018 for $2.9 million and later slashed its price to $2.25 million before another reduction to $2 million in September last year.While Chicago’s pace of luxury home trades has been rapid this year, sellers have frequently had to cut their initial asking prices to make deals.Latsko bought the Astor Street home built in 1887 through a land trust, and he and his family didn’t live in the home.When Latsko bought the Astor Street mansion, he said he planned to use it if and when his family wanted to downsize from their current home, the landmarked 9,768-square-foot Francis J. Dewes mansion in Lincoln Park. He had listed that Gothic-revival style house for sale in 2011 for $9.9 million, though it never sold. He bought it for $1.3 million. Latsko still owns another Gold Coast property that his family can use if they ultimately decide to move.The three-story Astor Street house sits on a 71-foot-wide lot at the corner of North Astor and East Scott streets, a block south of the Goudy Square Playground Park, and served as the main residence of Chicago’s French consul in the 1960s.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1236 N Astor St,Chicago developer, Fred Latsko is slimming down on mansions as he’s teed up a Fulton Market apartment tower as his next project.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/10/07/chicago-developer-fred-latsko-sells-gold-coast-mansion-for-2m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Chicago developer</a> Fred Latsko is slimming down on mansions as he’s teed up a Fulton Market apartment tower as his next project.","1236 N Astor St Chicago, IL","1236 N Astor St, Chicago, IL 60610, USA","(41.9050229, -87.62731509999999, 0.0)",41.9050229,-87.62731509999999,0.0,2022

The three-bedroom, 4,250-square-foot unit hit the market on Feb. 4 and went under contract two days later, according to Zillow.If the deal had closed, it would have marked the second-priciest residential sale in the city and the most expensive condo sale in Lincoln Park this year. The largest residential sale was the six-bedroom, 8,400-square-foot mansion at 1837 North Orchard Street, which sold for $8.7 million on Feb. 4. The priciest condo sale this year was in the same Lincoln Park tower, a 35th-floor unit in February; the buyer paid $5.8 million for the 4,700-square-foot, four-bedroom home.The seller of a penthouse unit at Lincoln Park is James Gearen, head of investment firm Gearen Holdings in Minneapolis and Chicago, and former executive of Chicago commercial real estate firm Zeller Realty. Gearen bought the space in December 2015 for $2.35 million and commissioned architect Kevin Toukoumidis of Dspace Studio to finish it. Garen’s condo features 12-foot ceilings, oversized white oak flooring, and two balconies that offer expansive views of the park, the lake, and the skyline.The unit, one of two penthouses in the building, was originally offered as a single 12,500-square-foot condo at about $13 million. When the space remained unsold after a few years, the developers split it into two units and Gearan bought it three years after the building was complete in 2012.At least seven single-family houses and condo units sold in the city for $4 million or more this year as of Feb. 23, setting the stage for another strong luxury residential market. This compares with only one sold in the city during the same period last year and more than 100 homes sold for $4 million-plus in 2021.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1837 North Orchard Street,A contract for a," penthouse unit at a Lincoln Park tower, which would’ve marked the second-priciest residential sale in Chicago this year, is expected to fall through, putting the apartment back on the market, The Real Deal learned.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/02/23/chicagos-second-priciest-residential-sale-this-year-falling-through/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A contract for a</a> penthouse unit at a Lincoln Park tower, which would’ve marked the second-priciest residential sale in Chicago this year, is expected to fall through, putting the apartment back on the market, The Real Deal learned.","1837 North Orchard Street Chicago, IL","1837 N Orchard St, Chicago, IL 60614, USA","(41.9149924, -87.6457614, 0.0)",41.9149924,-87.6457614,0.0,2022

The Cook County Circuit Court is expected to appoint real estate services firm Transwestern as the receiver next week.Chicago offices have suffered as people stayed home in the past year. The business district’s vacancy rate climbed to 17.9 percent in the third quarter, according to JLL, which expects the rate to rise as more sublease space becomes vacant.The 44-story Civic Opera House was struggling to fill the building even before the pandemic. Law firm Cassiday Schade exited its 60,000 square feet of offices in 2018.The pandemic also took a hit on two of its largest tenants, co-working providers Bond Collective and TeamWorking at TechNexus, which took up about 14 percent of the building. Smaller tenants also failed to pay rent, according to a statement by the owners.A February appraisal of the building valued it at $165 million, a 25 percent cut from $220 million in 2015, when the owners of the building refinanced with the current $164 million loan, according to data collected by Bloomberg and cited by Crain’s.601W and Berkeley are still renegotiating terms of the building’s mortgage with Rialto Capital, a special servicer that monitors the loan on behalf of investors in commercial mortgage-backed securities, Crain’s said.601W owns an office tower at 1 South Wacker Drive and is redeveloping a Northern Trust property at 801 South Canal Street into a multi-tenant office building.

The sale closed on September 30 and was reported on public listing sites Monday.The buyers haven’t been identified in public records. Connie Atterbury and Karen Schwartz, both of Dream Town Realty, brokered the deal, representing both the buyers and sellers.Driehaus was the chief investment office and chairman at Driehaus Capital Management.

According to Cook County Property records, the property was transferred to a trust in Inese’s name only. It’s unclear if the two were married at the time of his death.Mansions are a rarity in the Gold Coast, where ultra-luxury apartments and condos are more standard, making them difficult to price, and large drops between asking prices and final sales prices have been common.

The HNA Group affiliate, which is also the owner of a 44-story Park Avenue skyscraper in New York, filed for bankruptcy last year.HNA blamed SL Green, the property manager at 245 Park Avenue and New York’s largest office landlord, for the bankruptcy filing, saying the firm failed to secure a new anchor tenant at the property to replace Major League Baseball, whose lease expired on Oct. 31, 2021.Attorneys for SL Green objected to HNA’s reorganization plan, arguing the proposed transfer of the Chicago property was part of a fraudulent conveyance scheme to thwart SL Green, which has been trying to collect on a $185 million judgment it won against HNA Group in July.An attorney listed as the HNA affiliate’s representation in court records didn’t return a request for comment. HNA Group did not return a request for comment.The judgment stemmed from an arbitrator’s finding that HNA breached a contract related to SL Green’s investment in 245 Park Avenue. SL Green acquired the property last month.In the latest ruling, Judge Mary Walrath said she doubted whether HNA had proposed the transfer of the Chicago building in good faith and “could not in good conscience” approve it, adding that allowing the transfer would harm the SL Green affiliate seeking to collect on the previous judgment.Matthew Stein, who argued the objection on behalf of SL Green, called HNA’s proposed reorganization “a blatant last-minute attempt by HNA to transfer assets without consideration to hinder SL Green’s collection efforts.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",181 West Madison Street (181 West Madison Street,A U.S. bankruptcy," court judge roundly rejected an HNA Group affiliate’s reorganization attempt involving a Loop skyscraper, handing SL Green a victory in the dispute between the two firms.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/11/04/sl-green-wins-rejection-against-hna-transfer-of-loop-tower/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A U.S. bankruptcy</a> court judge roundly rejected an HNA Group affiliate’s reorganization attempt involving a Loop skyscraper, handing SL Green a victory in the dispute between the two firms.","181 West Madison Street (181 West Madison Street Chicago, IL","181 W Madison St, Chicago, IL 60602, USA","(41.8817441, -87.63353980000001, 0.0)",41.8817441,-87.63353980000001,0.0,2022

05:13 PM","A convicted Chicago real estate scammer’s former lawyer wants to hold onto condos he received from the client as payment in 2007, and is suing the banks trying to foreclose on them, claiming they are doing so fraudulently.","[""420 West Grand Avenue and 951 East Hyde Park Boulevard (River North Condos, Apartments)A convicted Chicago real estate scammer’s former lawyer wants to hold onto condos he received from the client as payment in 2007, and is suing the banks trying to foreclose on them, claiming they are doing so fraudulently.Rufus Cook, the former lawyer, and Robert Anthony Bryant, previously a client of Cook’s who served prison time in a scheme involving tax-delinquent real estate, filed a lawsuit late last month in Illinois federal court naming HSBC Bank, Bank of America, Citi, a Cook County judge and a slew of lawyers for the banks as defendants.Cook claims the defendants have no right to foreclose on his properties because they failed to keep adequate mortgage records. He says he’s getting robbed of due process in foreclosure proceedings that are still pending after 10 years of legal back-and-forth, and wants $2 million to cover damages he’s suffered, including attorneys’ fees, and to “punish defendants and deter such future violations,” according to court documents.“What this case is about is, among other things, the fraud the banks independently began committing in 2011 and 2012 when each fraudulently claimed to own a property it didn’t own,” Cook said in an email.Each of the defendant banks either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.Cook’s interest in the Chicago properties at the center of the federal lawsuit — condos at 951 East Hyde Park Boulevard and 420 West Grand Avenue, which also includes ground-floor commercial space — stems in part from his representation of Bryant. The former client was imprisoned from 2011 to 2015 after a federal judge found he defrauded more than 40 victims in a $1.4 million plot selling worthless documents pertaining to tax-delinquent real estate auctioned by Cook County, according to the Chicago Tribune. Bryant’s investors were unable to take titles with the papers and he rarely issued them refunds, prosecutors said at the time.Cook was told by federal officials he was being investigated as part of the scheme, too. Although there is no record of him being charged, Cook was disciplined in 2013 for representing both buyers and the seller in a transaction in which he had a personal interest, according to the Illinois State Bar Association.Bank of America is attempting to foreclose on one of the properties — which is listed for sale for $1.95 million by broker John Munson, who said he represents a trustee on a loan tied to the property and received offers but none at the price needed over the more than yearlong period it’s been marketed.“There is interest in this property, just not at the number they need,” Munson said.An auction was held for the property Feb. 25 and it fetched a $1.8 million bid, according to records of the Judicial Sales Corporation, which conducts most foreclosures sales in Cook County. Cook’s suit seeks to prevent a closing.Bank of America has indicated it holds claim to the property after a mortgage originally made to Bryant was transferred to the bank by another lender. Cook claims that Citi never had ownership of the mortgage and couldn’t have transferred it to Bank of America.Cook’s other property, a Hyde Park condo and commercial space, is being foreclosed on by HSBC, which he says is unable to prove it acquired the mortgage from the original lender on the property.In 2011, four years after the original lender’s bankruptcy, HSBC claimed to own the property records and sued Cook. The property is set for a sale March 30, according to the lawsuit, which claims that HSBC “still after over 14 years, [has] never having produced the negotiated note or a valid mortgage.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",420 West Grand Avenue,A convicted Chicago," real estate scammer’s former lawyer wants to hold onto condos he received from the client as payment in 2007, and is suing the banks trying to foreclose on them, claiming they are doing so fraudulently.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/03/04/chicago-real-estate-scammer-former-lawyer-allege-foreclosure-theft-against-big-banks/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A convicted Chicago</a> real estate scammer’s former lawyer wants to hold onto condos he received from the client as payment in 2007, and is suing the banks trying to foreclose on them, claiming they are doing so fraudulently.","420 West Grand Avenue Chicago, IL","420 W Grand Ave, Chicago, IL 60654, USA","(41.8917921, -87.6392637, 0.0)",41.8917921,-87.6392637,0.0,2022

It was respectively bought and sold by limited liability companies Mohawk Partners II and Mohawk Partners.The home has long been the residence of Anne Dias, the philanthropist, investor and ex-wife of Griffin. Yet its owners are not clear from public records since the property changed hands in July, and the home was previously purchased by an LLC for $8.35 million in February 2016. The couple divorced in 2015.The July deal was an apparent off-market transaction, and the brokers weren’t disclosed, so the fact it’s for sale again so quickly shows it could have remained in the family with the last deal.Emily Sachs Wong with @properties Christie’s International Real Estate and Susan Miner of Premier Relocation are representing the seller. Miner is also representing the listing for Ken Griffin’s Park Tower penthouse.Sachs Wong said she and Miner were not involved in the previous transaction in July, and so are unable to comment on the timing of the listing.“The seller is offering this fantastic home for sale in a market at a great price with very little similar inventory,” she said.It’s unclear why the home is seeking $500,000 less than its July sale price. Before this home’s July sale, the last deal for a Lincoln Park home for more than $10 million came in December, when an 8,000-square-foot home on North Burling Street fetched $12.5 million.Dias is the CEO of New York City-based Aragon Global Management, which she founded in 2001.Griffin, the CEO of hedge fund Citadel, announced in June that he was relocating the firm to Miami in light of Chicago’s issues with crime. In July, he listed his two full-floor penthouse condominiums in Park Tower on Michigan Avenue. The 66th- and 67th-floor units are asking $13.25 million and $15.75 million, respectively.Griffin listed four high-priced condos earlier this year as well, and one of those has found a buyer. The five-bedroom 7,400-square-foot condo unit on the 37th floor of the Waldorf Astoria was listed for $11.5 million. It’s unknown whether the deal will close at that price, which would mark a loss from the $13.3 million Griffin bought it for in 2014.Contact Miranda Davis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n Lincoln Park home fetches $10M, sets 2022 area record \n Kellogg CEO sells Lincoln Park home for $6.2M \n Chicago Bulls’ Vucevic drops $5M on Lincoln Park homeAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2026 N Mohawk St,A Lincoln Park," mansion with ties to billionaire Ken Griffin’s ex-wife is back on the market three months after its last sale — for $500,000 less than the price it just snagged.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/10/10/mansion-of-ken-griffins-ex-wife-hits-market-after-10m-july-sale/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A Lincoln Park</a> mansion with ties to billionaire Ken Griffin’s ex-wife is back on the market three months after its last sale — for $500,000 less than the price it just snagged.","2026 N Mohawk St Chicago, IL","2026 N Mohawk St, Chicago, IL 60614, USA","(41.91915789999999, -87.64280409999999, 0.0)",41.91915789999999,-87.64280409999999,0.0,2022

It is the only one of five $3 million-plus listings on a two-block stretch of Ashland to find a buyer since the first home was listed, according to the report.The seller was Marcia Coleman and the buyers were not yet identified in public records. Robert Swindal of @properties had the listing.Four other houses between 909 and 1000 Ashland started out with asking prices over $3 million in the past couple years, and all had to cut their asking prices below that threshold, according to Crain’s. None has found a buyer.Swindal said the languishing listings reflect buyers who don’t want to spend big money maintaining large houses — and soaring property taxes. The home he sold at 914 Ashland had a tax bill of more than $51,000 last year, up more than 30 percent from a decade earlier.Sales of $1 million-plus homes in the Chicago area grew by 1.4 percent last year, a dramatic drop from the 10 percent growth in sales of $1 million-and-up homes recorded in 2017, according to Crain’s.

The firm is under contract to buy the site from NRG Energy.A surge in the construction of Chicago-area data centers ballooned the industry’s regional vacancy rate from 2 percent to 11 percent last year. Pushed by growing demand for cloud-computing storage, developers built almost 57 megawatts of capacity — enough to power more than 16,000 homes — around the metro area in the first eight months of 2018, according to CBRE data.In addition to the data center project at the Fisk plant site, Hilco is redeveloping the former Crawford Coal Plant in Little Village into a 1 million-square-foot logistics complex.Both the Crawford and Fisk plants closed in 2012 after years of opposition from community groups and environmental activists. But the EPA is considering letting the Fisk plant use its “peaker” diesel generators during periods of high demands, according to Block Club.

Scores of firms have done the same over the last year across the city, including most recently Uber, which said it would look to sublease 150,000 square feet at 601W Companies’ Old Post Office; and rail car provider TTX, which put up 100,000 square feet of space at its West Loop headquarters.Groupon has hired CBRE to market all of the approximately 300,000 square feet at its HQ, in which the company’s name is emblazoned on the building. Its lease lasts at least through January 2024, according to the report. The company, which also subleases some space to a tech firm led by Groupon co-founder Brad Keywell, said it intended to “maintain an office on whichever floor isn’t subleased,” a spokesperson said.That follows a similar move last month in New York by Yelp and PricewaterhouseCoopers.

The sale and buyers haven’t appeared in Cook County records yet, but the deal showed up on public listing networks this week.Details on the property are slim, though at the time Mack bought the unit, it was reported to be a three-bedroom across half of a floor in the ultra-luxury building developed by JDL, which completed the 68-unit building in 2019. Mack’s former condo was equipped with a 14-foot kitchen island, a primary suite with a sitting area and wet bar and a 750-foot covered terrace with hot tub.Mack was far from the only high-profile professional athlete to have lived in the building. No. 9 Walton has drawn purchases by Jason Heyward, who just finished up his seventh and final season as a Cubs outfielder, as well as Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews of Blackhawks fame. Heyward and Toews sold their units for $7.2 million and $7 million, respectively, but Kane still owns his $6.4 million condo in the building.Ken Griffin, the financial chief and founder of Citadel who is moving his family and company to Miami because of Chicago’s crime rate, owns the top four floors of the building at 9 West Walton Street. Griffin, who spent $58 million for the floors in 2017, never finished the units. Ahead of his move, Griffin listed one of the No. 9 Walton units — a 7,085-square-foot unfinished unit on the 35th floor — for $14 million. It’s not yet known what he plans to do with the remaining three floors.The $6.9 million sale is the 31st Chicago-area home to sell for $6 million or more so far in 2022. In all of 2021, there were 32 sales at this level.JDL is in the midst of building its 812-unit One Chicago apartment project at 1 West Chicago Avenue. It will then turn to completing its multi-building North Union megadevelopment plan that will replace a portion of the Moody Bible Institute at Division and Wells streets in River North with multifamily housing.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",9 West Walton Street,Khalil Mack forced, his final turnover in Chicago — of high-end real estate.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/10/04/former-bear-khalil-mack-sells-gold-coast-condo-for-7m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Khalil Mack forced</a> his final turnover in Chicago — of high-end real estate.","9 West Walton Street Chicago, IL","9 W Walton St, Chicago, IL 60610, USA","(41.8998155, -87.62876759999999, 0.0)",41.8998155,-87.62876759999999,0.0,2022

Doctors in the building would serve both residents and outside patients, Ponte told Crain’s.She estimated the project would cost $500 million to $600 million.While most senior-housing developers in the Chicago-area have located their projects in the suburbs or outlying city neighborhoods, the Ponte project would look to get in on the broader demand for Downtown rentals that has led to an ongoing apartment boom in the central business district.

Green St. to the city’s Department of Planning and Development, according to Crain’s. A DPD committee is set to review the proposal on April 13.Chicago-based Golub and Des Plaines-based GSP aren’t entering the hottest part of the West Loop, the Fulton Market District. The site is further west of FMD and is occupied by a parking lot and several smaller buildings. Neither company responded to requests for comment from Crain’s.The development is one of many currently proposed or in the planning process in the West Loop. Before this project, there were over 9,000 apartments planned for the area. Many of those are near or within Fulton Market, an area of the city that has seen exponential growth in office and multifamily developments since 2017. It’s unclear how many of these projects will come to fruition, especially as mortgage rates increase.Designed by Chicago-based Goettsch Partners, the building would be 404 feet tall, making it the tallest building in a two-block radius, according to Crain’s. It would include a three-story base with a 128-parking spot garage.Golub is known for its developments in Streeterville, the Loop and South Loop, and the firm’s biggest project is the Tribune Tower condo redevelopment.

That’s about what landlord American Realty Advisors sought for the 520,000-square-foot complex at 1000 W. Fulton Market when it listed the property in late April.The price is also about 20 percent over what ARA paid Sterling Bay for the 10-story building in 2016. That’s a hefty return in a city office market whose first quarter vacancy rate climbed to a 15-year high. Google occupies 387,000 square feet in the nearly fully-leased building.In the other deal, Deka Immobilien is paying roughly $170 million for Sterling Bay’s 210 N. Carpenter Street complex. Google inked its lease for 132,000 square feet at the 200,000-square-foot building before construction completed in 2019.It marks Deka’s second big office buy in Chicago in a year.

A Burlington Coat Factory store taking up about 65,000 square feet is set to vacate and be replaced by clothing retailer Forman Mills, according to CBRE brokers assigned to leasing and selling the property.The Marshfield property doesn’t include the Jewel Osco grocery store and Blue Cross Blue Shield Community Center at its south end, which are owned separately and sold last year for $20 million to New York’s Beitel Group. Yet grocery stores and the consumer traffic they attract has appealed to retailers who want to locate nearby, boosting property values and investor demand.“Most of these shopping centers have performed well through the pandemic,” said CBRE’s Christian Williams, who represented PGIM, an arm of Prudential Financial, in the sale. “It has brought retail back into the forefront as an asset class. People to some degree have refocused on retail and said, ‘Hey it survived the evolution of e-commerce over the past decade and the pandemic.’”Grocery-anchored centers accounted for more than a third of retail transaction volumes in the first quarter across the nation this year, a spillover of last year’s record pace of deals for the asset class, according to JLL. Last year’s record totaled 735 trades of grocery-anchored assets, 13 more than a previous high set in 2014. Companies spent more than $13.3 billion on the properties, the largest share of any retail property type for a third year and the second-most in recorded history.As shopping center prices rise, profit margins have narrowed along with cap rates, a measure of the rental income a property generates compared with its purchase price, which dropped half a percentage point from from 2019 levels, JLL said this year.It’s the second grocery-anchored retail property that Williams’ team has closed in the range of $30 million in the last several weeks. He helped broker a deal for about that on behalf of the Sterling Organization in its sale of the 146,000-square-foot Hoffman Plaza in suburban Hoffman Estates to AmCap.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",11730 South Marshfield Avenue,Investor appetite, for Chicago’s grocery-anchored shopping centers is still booming even after trading volume for the asset class hit a record last year.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/03/allied-plunks-down-30m-for-south-side-shopping-center/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Investor appetite</a> for Chicago’s grocery-anchored shopping centers is still booming even after trading volume for the asset class hit a record last year.","11730 South Marshfield Avenue Chicago, IL","11730 S Marshfield Ave, Chicago, IL 60643, USA","(41.6802421, -87.66460000000001, 0.0)",41.6802421,-87.66460000000001,0.0,2022

Tsoumpas spent $25.2 million on the property in 2018, making the recent deal a 40 percent increase in value for the 74,800-square-foot store.Grocery stores nationwide have experienced boosts to their value as they’ve traded at higher velocity than usual in the past two years. In suburban Glenview, Arizona’s Nottinghill Gate Tucson paid Chicago’s Inland Real Estate $17.7 million for the 64,000-square-foot Jewel-Osco grocery store at 1340 Patriot Boulevard. The purchase marked a 42 percent increase in value over the $12.5 million it sold for in 2017. In addition, public records show that San Diego-based REIT Realty Income, paid New York’s Melohn Properties $52.4 million for a 65,500-square-foot Mariano’s store at 1625 South Clark Street in the Near South Side. The sellers bought the property in 2014 for $40.5 million.The Kroger chain-owned Mariano’s has a lease in the Crystal Lake property that will expire in 17 years. The store generates $1.48 million in net operating income.The buyer was insulated from rising interest rates. An existing mortgage against the property was inherited through the deal, meaning the buyer didn’t have to take out a new loan at a higher rate. The assumable mortgage increased the price, as the loan has a rate of 4.45 percent, whereas a new one would likely come with an interest above 6 percent, said Jason Meier of brokerage Stan Johnson, which arranged the deal.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",105 Northwest Highway (St,New York investor," Michael Tsoumpas sold a suburban Chicago Mariano’s supermarket for almost $36 million, reflecting the area’s strong grocery market and the premium prices the tenant’s brand has fetched owners on other real estate deals this year.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/10/11/ny-investor-sells-suburban-chicago-grocery-for-40-profit/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">New York investor</a> Michael Tsoumpas sold a suburban Chicago Mariano’s supermarket for almost $36 million, reflecting the area’s strong grocery market and the premium prices the tenant’s brand has fetched owners on other real estate deals this year.","105 Northwest Highway (St Chicago, IL","Parking lot, 105 N Northwest Hwy, Park Ridge, IL 60068, USA","(42.0101435, -87.82753439999999, 0.0)",42.0101435,-87.82753439999999,0.0,2022

Susan Miner, founder of Premier Relocation, Inc., is representing the sellers and didn’t respond to a request for comment.Interiors (Redfin)The listing joins the top end of the ultra luxury market in Chicago, with few other homes at that price point. The 7,500-square-foot full-floor penthouse unit on the 65th floor at One Bennett Park in Streeterville is now the highest-priced condo on the market, asking just over $15 million.Built in 2009, the Waldorf Astoria building includes condos on the upper floors and a hotel on the lower portion. Condo owners in the 60-story get access to the hotel’s amenities through a fee in their association assessments. Those include 24-hour security, room service, access to the spa, indoor pool, fitness center and Pilates studio.Interiors (Redfin)Condo sales have had a challenging year in Chicago. Despite several notable sales, such as the record-setting $20 million deal at Trump Tower in March, the condo market lags behind Chicago’s single-family market on several data points. Condos spend more time on the market, on average, than detached single-family homes. In the first three months of the year, Chicago houses sold after an average of 61 days on the market while condos sold in an average of 99 days.At a time when home prices are rising fast, in Chicago’s suburbs and in most city neighborhoods, the downtown condo market is a weak spot.In the first two months of the year, the median price of attached homes (condos and townhouses) sold in the city dipped 1.4 percent from a year earlier, according to CAR data, while for single-family homes, the median price rose 5.4 percent.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",11 E Walton Street,A $15M condo touted, last June as a sign the downtown condo market is coming back has returned — six months after it was taken off listing sites.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/05/13/waldorf-astoria-penthouse-asking-15m-comes-back-on-the-market/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A $15M condo touted</a> last June as a sign the downtown condo market is coming back has returned — six months after it was taken off listing sites.","11 E Walton Street Chicago, IL","11 E Walton St, Chicago, IL 60611, USA","(41.899701, -87.6276042, 0.0)",41.899701,-87.6276042,0.0,2022

Derek Kaptanoglu of Essex Realty Group represented the seller and buyer.“The property has been meticulously maintained by the same owner for the last 25 years,” Kaptanoglu told the Business Journal. “The suburban multifamily markets should remain extremely competitive for the remainder of 2022 as we continue to experience a major lack of inventory and large investor demand for well-located suburban properties.”The building, which is 100 percent occupied, has eight one-bedrooms and two two-bedrooms. It also has on-site laundry facilities and 10 parking spaces.Further north, Chicago investment firm Morningside USA sold the Stewart School Lofts apartments for $23 million. The firm bought the former school in a controversial deal in 2015.

There is a 33.5 percent increase from this time last year with properties under contract, showing strong demand.“According to local Compass agents, multiple offers and offers with few to no contingencies are still common in many areas yet buyers are willing to exercise more patience than they were at this time last year,” Stribling-Kivlan said.The new report comes after a similar January report that showed Chicago’s hot housing market was likely to continue.Pent-up demand continues to outweigh new supply, driving competition and price growth that will continue to give sellers an advantage. After steep declines in the inventory of homes available in 2020 and 2021, 44 percent of the agents expect supply to improve. Of the total, 39 percent said it will stay the same while 18 percent responded that inventory will decrease.According to that report, local realtors expect demand for homes seen during the pandemic to spill over into 2022, preventing a substantial increase of homes from accumulating on the market. This led 66 percent of respondents to predict that 2022 will continue to favor sellers.vRead more\n\n Chicago’s housing market frenzy seen continuing in 2022 \n Chicago’s on-market housing inventory at record low \n Chicago’s hot housing market scaring off first-time buyersAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",5 percent during the same period.St,Chicago had an," increase in year over year home sales for January 2022, in contrast to the national average decrease of 2.3 percent, according to a report from Compass, a national real estate brokerage company.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/03/14/chicago-housing-market-ahead-of-national-trends/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Chicago had an</a> increase in year over year home sales for January 2022, in contrast to the national average decrease of 2.3 percent, according to a report from Compass, a national real estate brokerage company.","5 percent during the same period.St Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2022

Michigan Ave. in Streeterville also includes a redevelopment of Tribune Tower, which is underway and stands next to the skyscraper site. That involves turning the 36-story former newspaper headquarters into a luxury condo development. Golub and CIM have planned 162 condo units, ranging from $700,000 to $7.6 million at the historic property.For the 113-story Tribune Tower East, plans call for 439 rental units, 125 condos and 200 hotel rooms. Below street level would be just under 11,000 square feet of retail space and 430 parking spaces accessible from lower-level streets.Zoning allows for 1.6 million square feet on the full site. CIM and Golub’s plans call for about 2 million square feet, and they plan to “buy” permission for the extra space by paying about $14 million into a commercial development fund.The project has been criticized by local residents for its scope and what they say will be the added congestion to the surrounding area. A revised version of the project addressed residents’ concerns, the developers said.\nThe tower would displace Trump Tower — 1,389 feet — as the city’s second tallest, and would rank behind only the Willis Tower, which rises 1,451 feet.

Little progress has been made on the 25,000-square-foot space between the purchase and this week, when Griffin announced his move, and it would cost about $25 million to make it livable.Walton developer Jim Letchinger and Coldwell Banker agent Chezi Rafaeli told the outlet that they’re concerned Griffin’s exit will hurt the luxury housing market in Chicago — specifically the building itself, which is also home to Chicago Cubs right fielder Jason Heyward, Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews and former Ferrara Candy CEO Todd Siwak.“Ken Griffin did contribute tremendously to the feeling of exclusivity,” Rafaeli told the outlet. “The magnitude of the price of his penthouse made them feel comfortable spending $11 million or $12 million on condos there.”Still, the fact that the space isn’t complete may work in its favor, because it may be easier to sell as individual floors rather than one large unit, Rafaeli said. Each floor could support its own kitchen and bathrooms, making it more feasible to split.The first and second floors would probably be marketed individually and the third and fourth floors would be offered as a duplex with the pool and rooftop, Letchinger said. Demand is high, Rafaeli said. One condo that wasn’t listed publicly sold for $17.4 million and Letchinger sold his own condo there for $9 million.Griffin, the state’s wealthiest resident, cited Chicago’s high crime rate among reasons for his departure.[CCB] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",12 million on condos there.”St,Citadel’s Ken," Griffin, the hedge fund billionaire who’s moving his family and business to Florida from Chicago, has a little unfinished business on the Gold Coast: A penthouse that he bought for a record $58 million.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/06/24/whats-next-for-ken-griffins-unfinished-58m-gold-coast-penthouse/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Citadel’s Ken</a> Griffin, the hedge fund billionaire who’s moving his family and business to Florida from Chicago, has a little unfinished business on the Gold Coast: A penthouse that he bought for a record $58 million.","12 million on condos there.”St Chicago, IL","US-12, Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8339297, -87.8741205, 0.0)",41.8339297,-87.8741205,0.0,2022

According to the proposal, most of the apartments will have balconies and the building will have a coworking lounge, fitness center and rooftop outdoor pool and deck.Luxury Living Founder and CEO Aaron Galvin said apartment demand has changed since the beginning of the pandemic. “We have seen a shift in renter demand asking for more one-bedroom and den spaces and paying premiums for units with private outdoor space,” Galvin said.Mavrek has developed multiple low-rise multifamily projects in Chicago, but this new project will represent Mavrek’s first highrise development in the central business district.[CCB] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",535 North St. Clair Street,A joint venture led," by Mavrek Development is planning a 21-story apartment building for a corner lot in Streeterville, just one block from the Magnificent Mile.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/04/18/mavrek-development-plans-21-story-highrise-apartment-building-for-streeterville/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A joint venture led</a> by Mavrek Development is planning a 21-story apartment building for a corner lot in Streeterville, just one block from the Magnificent Mile.","535 North St. Clair Street Chicago, IL","535 N St Clair St, Chicago, IL 60611, USA","(41.8919731, -87.6221473, 0.0)",41.8919731,-87.6221473,0.0,2022

Only four public listings are priced higher, including Michael Jordan’s $14.8 million Highland Park mansion and the $15.1 million penthouse at One Bennett Park. Should the home sell at $14 million, it would appear to be a record for Kenilworth.Inside of 501 Sheridan Road in Kenilworth, IL (Zillow)The home includes two lots on Lake Michigan shoreline, one of which currently houses a sculpture garden. The home is being sold by a trust established by the late owners of the house, who were not identified by public records. Though it has Lake Michigan Shoreline, it lacks a beach. The property has a multi-tiered walkway with a lower deck above boulders that line the water’s edge.Nancy Nugent, the Sotheby’s agent representing the estate selling the home, said the property was built in the 1960s and hasn’t been on the market since the 1970s. The home was shopped on the private market last October, but did not find a buyer at the time.Inside of 501 Sheridan Road in Kenilworth, IL (Zillow)Nugent said the five-bedroom, six-bathroom house is significant because it’s rare to find double lots on the lake in Kenilworth — a highly sought after suburb given its relative smaller size and appealing school district.Inside of 501 Sheridan Road in Kenilworth, IL (Zillow)“There’s some features of the town that have a very big draw for families coming to the north shore, both from the city and from other locations,” Nugent said.The home also offers buyers a blank slate to add any amenities they want, such as a sports court, golf simulator or pool.“Everyone wants their own private oasis,” she said. “Post-covid people like to have their own space, and that gives you the opportunity to do that.”Kenilworth has few other properties that compare, with no other listings over $5.5 million. No homes in recent years have fetched that price in the suburb, with the highest sale last year topping out at $11.8 million.Contact Miranda Davis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n Here are Chicago’s most expensive zip codes \n Lakefront mansion in Kenilworth is being shopped privately for record $14M \n North Shore lakefront mansion built by famed architect lists for $6.8MAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",501 Sheridan Road,A lakefront mansion, in Kenilworth is on the market with a hefty $14 million price tag.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/04/22/kenilworth-mansion-hits-the-market-at-rare-14m-asking-price/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A lakefront mansion</a> in Kenilworth is on the market with a hefty $14 million price tag.","501 Sheridan Road Chicago, IL","N Sheridan Rd, Chicago, IL, USA","(41.9781272, -87.6550313, 0.0)",41.9781272,-87.6550313,0.0,2022

The second floor will house a speakeasy-style bar and a pizza restaurant with a rock `n’ roll theme.Des Plaines hopes the theater will prompt more businesses to open up in the area. “It’s really about economic development,” said Michael Bartholomew, the city manager.[Chicago Tribune] — Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1 487 Miner Street,The Des Plaines," Theater, built in 1925 and shuttered in 2014, is preparing to reopen Oct. 1 after a $6.6 million renovation.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/09/03/century-old-des-plaines-theatre-set-to-open-in-october-after-6-6m-renovation/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Des Plaines</a> Theater, built in 1925 and shuttered in 2014, is preparing to reopen Oct. 1 after a $6.6 million renovation.","1 487 Miner Street Chicago, IL","1487 Miner St, Des Plaines, IL 60016, USA","(42.0408984, -87.8864862, 0.0)",42.0408984,-87.8864862,0.0,2021

Amalgamated Financial has an obligation to address those issues, which we believe are not financial in nature, and move forward with refiling their application with the FDIC. Our goal is to help them overcome the issues that have been raised and we are confident that the sale can get back on track.”The New York bank says it specializes its commercial real estate business on $3 million to 25 million deals in the New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and Bay Area metropolitan areas.Amalgamated of Chicago, which Crain’s reported has little union ownership now, had $1.6 billion in assets at the end of 2021, up from $950 million it had when it agreed to sell to the New York bank.The Chicago bank’s net income was $4.5 million in 2021, an increase from $3.5 million in 2020, while its 5 percent return on equity in 2021 lower than peer financial institutions, Crain’s reported.[Crain’s] – Sam Lounsberry \u200b\u200bAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",30 North LaSalle Street,Unity among two, union-affiliated banks in Chicago in New York is no longer being pursued.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/02/28/new-york-bank-halts-98m-purchase-of-amalgamated-bank-of-chicago/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Unity among two</a> union-affiliated banks in Chicago in New York is no longer being pursued.","30 North LaSalle Street Chicago, IL","30 North LaSalle, 30 N La Salle St, Chicago, IL 60602, USA","(41.8828891, -87.63278969999999, 0.0)",41.8828891,-87.63278969999999,0.0,2022

The 11-acre property, with a 26,000-square-foot building and 325 parking spaces, has been valued at about $12.5 million and the suggested opening bid is $2.5 million.“It’s been a very popular venue,” Rick Levin, principal of Rick Levin & Associates, the Chicago-based company holding the auction, told the outlet. “It could be so many things,” he said, noting that replicating it would cost more than $10 million.Since the auction involves the real estate and not the business, the site could be used for something other than a banquet hall. A buyer could repurpose it as medical offices, retail space, senior housing or a hotel, Levin’s firm said. Alsip Mayor John Ryan said he hopes the property will continue to be run as a banquet facility as it would require minimal updates before reopening.“That’s a turnkey operation,” Mayor Ryan told the outlet. “It’s ready for any banquet operator.”If the buyer chooses not to use the property to host weddings and other events, Ryan said using the space for retail might be the next best option.The auction for what Levin called an “unusual property” will be held through sealed bids.[DS] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",11535 South Cicero Avenue,A shuttered banquet, hall in the southern Chicago suburb of Alsip is set to hit the auction block.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/07/11/shuttered-alsip-banquet-hall-to-hit-auction-block-this-year/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A shuttered banquet</a> hall in the southern Chicago suburb of Alsip is set to hit the auction block.","11535 South Cicero Avenue Chicago, IL","11535 S Cicero Ave, Alsip, IL 60803, USA","(41.6829994, -87.7379612, 0.0)",41.6829994,-87.7379612,0.0,2022

A CBRE spokesman declined to comment on the transaction. ExchangeRight and North American Real Estate did not return requests for comment.Investors have put more than $250 million into such businesses in the Chicago metro area over the last several months, with trades of grocery-anchored assets hitting a record high in 2021 according to JLL.Recent deals have handed profits to sellers — making the CBRE deal stand out — with owners such as Broad Reach Retail Partners profiting on deals like an $18 million sale of a Wauconda Jewel Osco to AmCap for $18 million, up from the $14 million the property fetched in 2017. In Crystal Lake, a venture led by New York investor Michael Tsoumpas recently sold a Mariano’s-anchored shopping center for a 40 percent profit in a $36 million deal.The sale also comes as Kroger-owned Mariano’s stores may be under the eye of federal regulators, as the parent company of the approximately 45 Chicago-area seeks to merge with Albertsons. The latter is the owner of local brand Jewel-Osco, which operates about 170 stores in the Chicago area.ExchangeRight’s portfolio includes more than 21 million square feet and $5.3 billion worth of assets under management across 47 states.

Calk, the former CEO of the Federal Savings Bank, bought the property in October 2018 for a little more than $3.2 million through Chicago Title and Land Trust Company that concealed his name. He put it on the market 10 months after buying it.Built in 2009, the fully furnished house sits on a little more than an acre on Meadowood Lane. Inside the house is a hanging wooden staircase landing in a marble-floored foyer and crenellated facade and arched windows. The property also comes with a library, a sauna, gym, and theater, four fireplaces, and a three-car garage.Out back, a bluestone terrace overlooks the formal garden, fountains and a tennis court. John Mawicke and Megan Mawicke Bradley from @properties are representing the house.Calk, a member of candidate Trump’s economics advisory team in 2016, was charged with directing loans to campaign chairman Manafort that would help finish his construction of a Brooklyn condominium and avoid foreclosure. According to U.S. prosecutors, those loans were in exchange for a senior post in the Trump administration.Manafort helped Calk secure interviews, but was never hired. Federal Savings Bank incurred a multimillion-dollar loss when Manafort defaulted on the loans.Calk is set to be sentenced on Feb. 7 for his conviction in July on financial institution bribery and conspiracy charges in Manhattan federal court.

10:59 AM",Yitzy Klor’s Strategic Properties of North America is closing in on its latest Chicago condo deconversion deal after swaying enough owners of a 310-unit Loop building into accepting a $96 million offer to turn the property into apartments.,"[""Dov Grinblatt and 200 North Dearborn, Chicago (LinkedIn, Getty, City of Chicago)Yitzy Klor’s Strategic Properties of North America is closing in on its latest Chicago condo deconversion deal after swaying enough owners of a 310-unit Loop building into accepting a $96 million offer to turn the property into apartments.Such deals — known as a condo deconversions — have been on the upswing since 2015. They have steadily transformed much of northern Illinois’ condo stock into rentals.Klor’s latest deal for the building at 200 North Dearborn Street in the Loop could close by the end of the year, said Jon Taylor, owner of the 47th floor penthouse at the property.Taylor said he supported the sale in an election held by the property’s condo association board, although the decision wasn’t unanimous, meaning some of its residents are being forced into selling against their will.City law allows a buyer to close on an entire condo building in Chicago without all of its unit owners on board if an offer is approved by owners holding at least 85 percent of a building’s value, giving those who object no choice but to relinquish their units.Aaron Robinson, a 37-year-old United Airlines employee who works at Willis Tower and has been a unit owner at the building on Dearborn for three years, said the ballot on the sale made the 85 percent threshold by just two vote. He was disappointed by the approval and the process that led up to it, which he and another resident said included offers not made in writing of additional cash beyond the value of their units from Strategic Properties to convince owners to vote in favor of the deal.“For me, it’s just a fantastic location downtown,” Robinson said. “The idea of selling and leaving was a little crazy for me, especially right now as mortgage rates are rising and after I refinanced at the bottom of the mortgage market during Covid.”Klor, whose Strategic Properties didn’t respond to requests for comment, is CEO of the city’s most prolific condo deconversion buyer. The company also is working to close a $190 million record-breaking purchase of the condo building at 10 East Ontario Street that’s been delayed by litigation.The Dearborn building was a prime target for a deconversion sale because it was originally developed as apartments in 1989 and turned into condos in the 2000s, and most of the units are now investor-owned and rented out to their residents. Such condo building ownership structures became more common after the 2008 financial crisis caused the Chicago condos market to crash, making them less appealing to live-in owners and leaving investors with plans to run rental businesses as a way to pick up the pieces.Deconversion sales started appealing to investors as condo unit values fell short of their levels from before the Great Recession and multifamily rents soared, making condo buildings far more valuable when run as a single-owner apartment property asset than the sum of the unit values as individually owned homes. The phenomenon has allowed deconversion buyers to make offers to condo owners above-market from what they would get out of an individual unit’s sale.Some condo lawyers have criticized the lack of guardrails governing the condo deconversion process in Illinois, which have led to a dearth of clarity surrounding the legality of buyers performing backroom negotiations with unit owners to reach the supermajority of votes needed to close a deal.A condo board member for 200 North Dearborn and KSN, the law firm representing the condo board, didn’t respond to requests for comment.For Taylor, the penthouse owner who purchased the unit that had been left as raw space and poured cash into finishing the home, the deal provided an exit from the property he’d been seeking since moving to Park City, Utah, and a path to the building undergoing much-needed improvements unlikely to be funded by the condo owners.“The buyers reached out directly to me, and we spoke about how to try and get the deal through,” Taylor said. “They really didn’t play too much hardball. I came in very honestly, saying here’s what it’s worth, here’s what I spent. They came back with an honest assessment.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",200 North Dearborn Street,Yitzy Klor’s, Strategic Properties of North America is closing in on its latest Chicago condo deconversion deal after swaying enough owners of a 310-unit Loop building into accepting a $96 million offer to turn the property into apartments.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/04/loop-condo-owners-approve-96m-deconversion-sale-to-yitzy-klors-spna/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Yitzy Klor’s</a> Strategic Properties of North America is closing in on its latest Chicago condo deconversion deal after swaying enough owners of a 310-unit Loop building into accepting a $96 million offer to turn the property into apartments.","200 North Dearborn Street Chicago, IL","200 N Dearborn St, Chicago, IL 60601, USA","(41.8860876, -87.6300102, 0.0)",41.8860876,-87.6300102,0.0,2022

It had been listed since May and under contract since July.A filming location website describes the owners, who records show are Richard and Jill Stockard, as film friendly and says the home has been used for filming by the shows “Chicago PD” and “Empire.”The home attracted major agents on both sides of the deal, with Jeff Lowe of Compass representing the seller and Matt Leutheuser and Tim Salm with Sotheby’s International Realty representing the buyer.Lowe’s group is at the top of The Real Deal’s first Chicago residential broker ranking, with $381.42 million in yearly sales. Leutheuser and Salm represent some of the city’s most well known listings — including the late Richard Driehaus’ mansion that was used in a scene in John Hughes’ “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” as well as the 25,000-square-foot, $45 million listing for a Lincoln Park property that is not currently active but considered the most expensive home in Chicago.Neither agent responded to a request for comment.Last year, a six-bedroom home in the Bucktown neighborhood sold for $3.725 million, the priciest sale in the neighborhood of 2021. That likely makes this $4.4 million home a new all-time record for the area, barring any private, off-market transactions.The property sold last year, at 1622 Wolcott, was developed by Stratum Builders, and the $4.4 million property was developed by Chicago-based Environs, founded by Ken Brinkman.According to reports published at the time of the sale of 1622 Wolcott, the record price for a home near Bucktown came in 2015, when a new five-bedroom contemporary mansion sold for $4.819 million.Correction: This story was updated to correct the developer of 1622 North Wolcott Avenue.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1743 N Wolcott Avenue,"UPDATED, Nov. 2,"," 2022 11 a.m. A sleek, 7,600-square-foot Bucktown mansion featured in two Chicago-based TV shows sold for one of the highest prices ever for the trending neighborhood.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/10/31/bucktown-home-filmed-for-chicago-tv-shows-resets-neighborhood-bar/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">UPDATED, Nov. 2,</a> 2022 11 a.m. A sleek, 7,600-square-foot Bucktown mansion featured in two Chicago-based TV shows sold for one of the highest prices ever for the trending neighborhood.","1743 N Wolcott Avenue Chicago, IL","1743 N Wolcott Ave, Chicago, IL 60622, USA","(41.9136118, -87.6747807, 0.0)",41.9136118,-87.6747807,0.0,2022

Earlier this year, his Lake Geneva mansion sold for $36 million, more than the sum of the second- and third-priciest homes in the area, after three months on the market. Another mansion he owned on North State Parkway has been on the market since July with a $4.9 million ask.In 1986, the house was used to film a brief exterior shot of the fictional Chez Quis restaurant in John Hughes’ “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.” The side entrance of the home, which opens onto West Schiller Street, can be seen in a seconds-long shot. The scene was filmed before Driehaus transformed the home and its exertion appearance is quite different today.The home has two main living rooms and features vintage ornamental plaster on the walls and ceilings, herringbone-patterned hardwood floors and multiple grand chandeliers.It also features two staircases.

It includes an indoor basketball court, pool, home theater, golf simulator, club room and library, home gym, sauna and wine cellar, according to listing images.Milena Birov of @properties Christie’s International Real Estate represented the sellers, and Jena Radnay of the same firm represented the buyers, who weren’ disclosed in public records. The sellers purchased the home with a title and trust company, and are not listed in Cook County records.The sellers bought the home for $5.2 million in 2011 and previously listed it in 2013 and 2014 for $7.6 million. It was the 14th to sell for at least $7 million this year in the Chicago metropolitan area, not including all off-market or private transactions.The luxury market, especially high-end suburbs like Winnetka, hasn’t slowed to the same degree as other areas of Chicago, even as mortgage rates rise in tandem with concern a recession is on the way. The town has one of the area’s most expensive listings, a 1902 home seeking $16 million that sits on 1.75 acres and includes 151 feet of Lake Michigan beachfront.Winnetka has been the center of controversy in recent weeks after city officials dropped plans to build a seawall between a public beach and local billionaire Justin Ishbia’s property after public outcry. The proposal would have put a six-and-a-half foot steel wall built atop stone breakwaters on park district property, not Ishbia’s property next door.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",722 Prospect Avenue,A Winnetka mansion," sold for $7.5 million, signaling resilience for Chicago’s single-family suburban home market.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/11/winnetka-mansion-sells-for-7-5m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A Winnetka mansion</a> sold for $7.5 million, signaling resilience for Chicago’s single-family suburban home market.","722 Prospect Avenue Chicago, IL","S Prospect Ave, Chicago, IL 60643, USA","(41.707252, -87.6621311, 0.0)",41.707252,-87.6621311,0.0,2022

Residents were given five days’ notice to evacuate the building after 33 Realty missed the Nov. 5 deadline.During a building inspection on Oct. 22, the village of Oak Park found that the floors throughout the building had an unusual slope — something residents had noticed before. “When you take out a shopping cart in the front, it rolls down,” resident Joyce Brown told ABC 7.The inspector noted that in the front and back units of the building, the floors had slopes as steep as three or four inches. An unfinished unit in the rear of the building also had a cracked concrete floor.A structural engineer hired by building management made note of the same problems in the building, but couldn’t issue an official opinion without doing a full analysis. That process could take up to a month to complete and could require the floors to be opened up to fully examine the building’s structure.“The safety and well-being of our residents is our only priority,” Eric Weber, one of the owners of 33 Realty, which took over management of the building just two months ago, told the Chicago Sun-Times. “Every resident has been contacted in person or in writing. And they’ve been notified they have a place to live.”However, residents of 930 North Boulevard, who just paid rent for their apartments, say the property manager is reportedly not answering or returning calls from the tenants. Additionally, the manager hasn’t submitted a required evacuation plan with the village either.“We’ve heard nothing. We’ve left voicemails, emails,” Denise Eugenides, who flew in to help her 85-year-old mother who lives in the building, told ABC 7. “We are at a loss. She’s up there in complete shock.”[ABC7] — Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",930 North Boulevard,Residents of an Oak, Park apartment building were forced to vacate their homes after a building inspection discovered sloping floors.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/11/10/oak-view-tower-residents-forced-to-evacuate-homes-due-to-sloping-floors/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Residents of an Oak</a> Park apartment building were forced to vacate their homes after a building inspection discovered sloping floors.","930 North Boulevard Chicago, IL","930 North Blvd, Oak Park, IL 60301, USA","(41.8875353, -87.79869579999999, 0.0)",41.8875353,-87.79869579999999,0.0,2021

Morgan St. The project is one of 19 multifamily developments planned or under construction in Fulton Market. One reason for the staggering growth: Google and other tech companies moved into the area within the last several years.“With its strong pipeline of incoming corporate headquarters, innovative retailers and promising tech ventures, the area now needs more multifamily options that can accommodate a young, modern workforce,” Sterling Bay CEO Andy Gloor says in a statement.The additional apartments, and the tenants they bring, will likely transform the neighborhood, with additional density and a modern neighborhood where residents have access to housing, jobs and retail. The new residents also will put additional strains on infrastructure.Sterling Bay is also planning three more buildings with 1,371 apartments in the neighborhood, one at 1245 W. Fulton St. and two at 1300 W. Carroll St. Related Midwest is constructing a 43-story, 300-unit apartment tower at Randolph and Peoria streets. And a venture led by Chicago developer Tom Roszak is building a 27-story, 375-unit project at Randolph and Elizabeth streets, and Shapack Partners is planning two Fulton Market projects totaling 591 apartments, while Fulton Street Cos. plans two buildings with 833.Much of the boom came because Fulton Market lifted a residential zoning ban last year.The projects in the planning stages aren’t a done deal. Rising interest rates, increased construction costs, city approval and a recession could all factor into whether they will actually be developed.Rents in the downtown area continue to climb, while other cities are still rebounding from pandemic departures, data show.The average rent in Chicago was $2,332 a month in January 2022.

The home, about 40 miles northwest of the city, has attracted some interest after being relisted, he said.It has six bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, a large outdoor pool, boat slip and garage parking for nine cars, according to the listing. The estate has been featured as the home of lead actor Terrance Howard’s character Lucious Lyon on “Empire,” since 2014. The show concluded with its sixth season in 2020.The property is an outlier in Barrington Hills, where homes haven’t sold for more than $5 million in recent years.

Interior designer Kara Mann and private equity firm Left Bank Holdings took 4,000 and 2,000 square feet, respectively, at the same building.A tenant the company declined to identify, who R2’s Zack Cupkovic said is a well-known Chicago artist and designer, also signed a lease for a 16,000-square-foot space at 1315 North Branch Street, which Hines bought for $47 million earlier this year, though R2 still handles its leasing. Additionally, recruiter Eight Eleven Group expanded its 4,000-square-foot office footprint to 10,000 square feet at R2’s 770 North Halsted Street.“There aren’t a ton of tenants in the market right now, to be candid, for office, but the ones that are in the market, they don’t want to be in the Loop,” Cupkovic said, adding that those tenants want something more boutique than an office in a high-rise.Cupkovic said the flurry of leasing is a counterpoint to Chicago’s office market as a whole. The city’s total leasing dropped to its lowest level in more than a year in the third quarter, with transactions totaling 1.8 million square feet, according to a report from Savills.R2 started buying property on Goose Island in 2014. In 2017, the city approved zoning changes for the area to allow residential and office development outside of a district that remains solely zoned for industrial buildings. Cupkovic said about 140,000 square feet of its 200,000 square feet of available office space is leased. The company also owns and has repositioned the Morton Salt Shed as a performance venue with some office spaces, which Cupkovic said has 100,000 square feet of its 120,000 square feet leased.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1200 North Branch Street,While geese are," flying south for the winter, tech and design professionals are flocking to Chicago’s Goose Island for offices, a reflection of the market’s concentration of tenants seeking untraditional commercial real estate for their workspace.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/11/18/r2-companies-inks-54000-sf-in-goose-island-office-leases/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">While geese are</a> flying south for the winter, tech and design professionals are flocking to Chicago’s Goose Island for offices, a reflection of the market’s concentration of tenants seeking untraditional commercial real estate for their workspace.","1200 North Branch Street Chicago, IL","1200 N North Branch St, Chicago, IL 60642, USA","(41.9040302, -87.65641769999999, 0.0)",41.9040302,-87.65641769999999,0.0,2022

The 150-foot-long display inside Riverside Investment & Development’s office tower combines art, architecture and technology, featuring works of Chicago artists and those from around the world, all-but stopping visitors in their tracks.Called 150 Media Stream, the attention-grabbing display is also one of a growing number of art installations in commercial and residential developments around Chicago that tap into the digital age. The flashy works come at a time when competition among developers and property owners has intensified to differentiate their projects and cater to the changing needs of a new generation of tenants.“The art budgets do appear to be increasing,” said Gail Lissner, managing director at consulting firm Integra Realty Resources. “As new buildings get built, developers are raising the bar. It’s another item for them to stand above the crowd.”The displays can also be a not-so-subtle way to reimagine and throw a spotlight on an existing building, as in the September debut of “Art on the Mart.” That project has turned Vornado Realty Trust’s 4 million-square foot Merchandise Mart into a massive digital projection screen. Five days a week for two hours a day, the river-facing facade is a canvas for public art, with thousands of onlookers staring at and taking photos of the 88-year-old art deco building.Artwork has long been a prominent feature in large developments around the city, particularly in downtown office buildings, though the focus has leaned more traditional. That was also the case with Lendlease’s 29-story Cooper at Southbank apartment building in Printers Row, which opened in September at 720 South Wells Street. The Cooper features work from artist Nick Albertson, whose abstract photography hangs in the lobby of the 452-unit building. Lendlease also commissioned 10 original pieces from artist David Wolske for the larger Southbank development.As with many new developments around the Chicago, the Cooper is loaded with amenities like a “namaste nook” for private yoga lessons and a grill deck with rain-resistant widescreen TVs suspended above each grate.But while those features are only for tenants, high-tech art displays are taking on a more central role because they can also serve as a form of public advertising in the digital age, developers and real estate experts said.Tony Scacco, at Riverside Investment, said other factors were also at play to explain their recent prominence. The first is that the battle to ink large leases at Downtown developments has heated up, and the second is the pressure to meet the changing demands and desires of tenants.More corporations are moving offices to Downtown, in part to attract the Millennial labor pool, Scacco said. That is a generation whose living and working habits have led developers to alter their offerings and amenities. That shift comes at a time when the suburban office market has hit a skid. The vacancy rate for that market crept up to 23.7 percent at the end of the second quarter, the highest it’s been since 2014, according to JLL.“There’s just been fundamental changes with the manner in which companies of all types are using their office space,” Scacco said. Since the financial downturn, he said, companies have had to completely rethink how to attract Millennials. That hasn’t happened “for any generation previous.”For developers — office and residential — that has meant a smaller, more dense living or working space, with more of an emphasis on amenities and features that offer “experiences,” like a rooftop terrace or a massive art installation.“What we’re trying to do is create a unique and amenity-robust environment within which our clients can recruit and retain” employees, Scacco said.Standing outTaris Real Estate’s 900 West Washington luxury condo building is another new development using digital art technology, this one to help create an identity in a crowded market.When completed, the 22-unit development in the changing West Loop neighborhood will include a lobby grand chandelier that doubles as a digital art installation, creating a whirl of color and light in the lobby that will project onto the building’s street-facing windows. Units will cost between $1.4 to $5.5 million.That West Loop area has been setting records in the $1 million and over residential market, according to a Re/Max third quarter report. There were 43 sales of attached units in that luxury category through the end of October, compared to 16 last year and none five years ago.As the prices climb higher, buyers expectations can also rise, for something bigger and better.“It’s a recent trend to be more interactive,” said Taris’ Patrick Buck. “We wanted the building to look aesthetically good now and also fit into the community 20 years from now.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",150 Media St,A two-story video," wall comprised of 89 LED blades stands as a visually striking entrance at the lobby of 150 North Riverside Plaza.

The John Buck Company already signed Facebook to a 263,000-square-foot lease in its recently completed CNA Center and Google is looking to add another 100,000 square feet of office space in Fulton Market.

09:22 AM",Adventus Realty Trust is turning around a Chicago-area office building near O’Hare airport that lost two big tenants last year to leave it 60 percent empty.,"[""Adventus’ Rodney Johnston and 5600 North River Road (LinkedIn, Adventus)Adventus Realty Trust is turning around a Chicago-area office building near O’Hare airport that lost two big tenants last year to leave it 60 percent empty.The Vancouver, Canada-based landlord of 3 million square feet of offices across suburban Chicago struck a deal with Chicago Mortgage Solutions to lease 55,000 square feet in the Columbia Center in suburban Rosemont, people familiar with the negotiations told The Real Deal.It was a win for Adventus to refill a space left empty by kitchenware maker Corelle Brands, which had based its offices there for years until exiting in December, just as the building’s anchor tenant, exercise equipment company Life Fitness, also left a 95,000-square-foot lease to move to an office twice that size in suburban Franklin Park. Adventus is also in talks to reload half the Life Fitness space with a new tenant by next month, said the landlord’s COO, Rick Charlton.“It looks like we’re going back into the teens for the Columbia Center’s vacancy rate by year-end at the latest,” Charlton said in an interview. “The market is so big in Chicago, you’re always going to have some structural vacancy, which we peg around 10 percent that’s constantly going to be there. In our Class A office submarket, we’re closer to 17 or 18 percent vacant right now. Our assets are generally outperforming the market.”While suburban Chicago’s office vacancy ticked up to record highs in five straight quarters as of earlier this year, hitting 27 percent in April, filling the Corelle space within months shows the resilience of suburban assets in easy to access locations and the draw of being next door to O’Hare International Airport, the world’s fourth-busiest. The overall market’s vacancy rate is being driven up by low-quality assets in hard-to-reach areas.Adventus bought the three-building, 620,000-square-foot Columbia Center complex on North River Road and West Bryn Mawr Avenue in 2014 for $93.1 million, when it was nearly full, and drew concern early this year from ratings agency DBRS Morningstar over its $41.8 million commercial mortgage-backed security loan against the former Life Fitness building when its two largest tenants exited.“As the risks have significantly increased from issuance, with market challenges that could mean those risks are sustained at an increased level for the longer term,” a January report on the loan said.Even with those issues alleviated by the lease with the residential mortgage company and 12 others totaling 125,000 square feet across Adventus’ suburban Chicago buildings in the past seven months, plus the potential deal to replenish the Life Fitness space, the landlord isn’t necessarily out of the woods. Its portfolio includes a distressed property in suburban Oak Brook that Adventus may surrender.Read on to learn more from Charlton about how his company is dealing with that property and why it spent almost $12 million during the pandemic to add dozens of spec suites and upgrade lobbies, fitness centers and food services. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.We’re likely to let it go back to the lender. We’re in that process right now and it’s very cooperative. We’ve found a potential purchaser for it, so there could be a short sale. It’s unfortunate and none of us are happy with that. But it was just a business decision. It’s not reflective of the health of Adventus. We just did a $350 million financing last year with Credit Suisse using CMBS debt. The company is not the issue.We’ve just redone and upgraded every lobby in all three Riverway buildings and are in the process of finishing work in the auditorium. It’s a totally different asset today than it ever was. We had a broker reception a couple weeks back there, and one of the guys said Riverway used to be the place to be and then it just got old, but that we’ve brought it back. Our vision of Riverway is working. There is a flight to quality and we’re the quality.(Plans included) the development of over 24 rent-ready suites to date with 90 percent leased or under negotiation. Additional rent-ready suites are under construction. Their cost is approximately $3.3 million. A lot are smaller, anywhere from 1,500 to 5,000 square feet. The rent-ready suite program and investment in our assets was initiated mid-Covid anticipating a flight to quality and the need for move-in ready suites, all of which is now bearing fruit.Our Atlanta portfolio is currently at its lowest vacancy level, 6.2 percent, in the past five years. I hear a lot of negativity about suburban offices but we’re loving it right now. Our leasing strategy has achieved positive results with approximately 238,000 square feet of leasing overall completed in Chicago and Atlanta since November 2021. We consider this to be exceptional, particularly given the challenges the economy faces coming out of Covid.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",5600 North River Road,Adventus Realty, Trust is turning around a Chicago-area office building near O’Hare airport that lost two big tenants last year to leave it 60 percent empty.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/07/07/adventus-lands-55000sf-mortgage-company-lease-to-refill-suburban-office/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Adventus Realty</a> Trust is turning around a Chicago-area office building near O’Hare airport that lost two big tenants last year to leave it 60 percent empty.","5600 North River Road Chicago, IL","5600 N River Rd, Rosemont, IL 60018, USA","(41.9810865, -87.8630316, 0.0)",41.9810865,-87.8630316,0.0,2022

Its partner, Miami-based Lennar Corporation, will put up a seven-story apartment building with 300 units on the 4.1-acre triangular property bounded by Elston Avenue, Webster Avenue and Metra’s UP-North line tracks, not far from Sterling Bay’s planned Lincoln Yards megadevelopment.The condominium units range in size from about 1,200 square feet and 2,100 square feet. They start at $516,000 for a smaller two-bedroom unit. More than 25 percent of the condos in the building are already under contract, according to Belgravia.A third building offering retail space is also planned for the project.In late 2018, Belgravia and Lennar paid $21.8 million for the two parcels where they’re building the mixed-use residential development.The firms recently secured a $69 million loan from Wells Fargo for the project.Triangle Square is expected to be completed sometime next year.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1701 West Webster Avenue,Construction is, underway on the first residential development in Chicago’s 760-acre North Branch Corridor since the area was rezoned in 2017.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2020/03/03/construction-begins-on-belgravias-triangle-square-condos/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Construction is</a> underway on the first residential development in Chicago’s 760-acre North Branch Corridor since the area was rezoned in 2017.","1701 West Webster Avenue Chicago, IL","1701 W Webster Ave, Chicago, IL 60614, USA","(41.9213507, -87.6711541, 0.0)",41.9213507,-87.6711541,0.0,2020

Real estate developer Jerald Lasky, who owned the house via a trust that concealed his identity, paid $5.26 million for the home in February 2021.Lasky, who made about a profit of about 10 percent on the sale, first listed the property in June with an asking price of $6.5 million. The listing was taken down two weeks later and the sale was posted at the end of July. The new owner bought the home via a legal entity that conceals their identity.The sale of the home reflects a strong luxury housing market in the Windy City, where 49 homes hit the $5 million threshold, up from 20 in 2020.Built in 1883, the State Parkway home underwent a multiyear renovation and expansion by real estate developers Randy and Steve Fifield after they bought it in 2011 for almost $5 million.The house was the fictional home of the family in the 1980s TV sitcom “Webster,” which starred Emmanuel Lewis playing an orphan adopted by his godparents.In 2016, Chicago native Dwyane Wade, who had just left the Miami Heat for the Chicago Bulls, rented the home as well. Just before Wade’s arrival, it had been listed for $9.5 million. Three years later, in 2019, the home was back on the market, this time asking $7.9 million.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1432 N St,A Gold Coast mansion," that once housed an NBA star and a fictional TV family sold for $5.8 million, the 38th Chicago-area home to top $5 million so far this year.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/07/29/former-gold-coast-home-of-dwyane-wade-sells-for-5-8m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A Gold Coast mansion</a> that once housed an NBA star and a fictional TV family sold for $5.8 million, the 38th Chicago-area home to top $5 million so far this year.","1432 N St Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2022

The completed 19,000-square-foot complex would include about 4,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and a rooftop deck.The building has sat empty since Humadieh paid $500,000 to buy it in 2004, and its facade has since begun to “buckle and collapse under its own weight,” Englewood operations director Chuck Taylor said.The bone-deep rehab will also involve removing and resetting all the building’s floor plates farther apart from one another, a recurrent challenge in transforming the neighborhood’s 20th-century industrial warehouses into modern office and dining destinations.“It didn’t need very high ceilings as a meatpacking building, but it’s going to need all that space for future use,” Taylor said. “Not just so you can run all the mechanicals, but because that’s what users are looking for right now.”The new facade will mimic its original brick-and-limestone design, he said.When it comes time to court office tenants for the building, the landlord will have to compete with more than a million square feet of new workspace now planned within a stone’s throw of the Google office and adjacent CTA station. The wave of ambitious ground-up projects from developers like Sterling Bay, Shapack Partners and Thor Equities has been enough to pull the city’s overall office demand west of Downtown.But gut rehabs of low-rise warehouses have played an equally big part in the West Loop’s ascendence, especially in its flourishing dining scene. Developers like Convexity have bought up meatpacking plants and turned them into homes for renowned restaurants like Duck Duck Goat, Kuma’s Corner and The Publican.Humadieh’s building, which might include a restaurant in its retail space, will be next door to a nearly 13,000-square-foot food hall soon to be opened by McCaffery Interests at 1115 West Fulton.It also would be next to a building where businessman and strip club owner Perry Mandera in 2014 proposed opening a medical marijuana dispensary until Alderman Walter Burnett (27th) rejected the proposal, according to DNAinfo.Englewood is aiming to have the building ready for tenants by early next year.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1107 West Fulton Street,The owner of a long-,vacant Fulton Market meatpacking plant is preparing to open the neighborhood’s newest office project in the shadow of Google’s Midwest headquarters.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/04/24/fulton-market-meatpacking-plant-to-become-neighborhoods-next-boutique-office/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The owner of a long-</a>vacant Fulton Market meatpacking plant is preparing to open the neighborhood’s newest office project in the shadow of Google’s Midwest headquarters.","1107 West Fulton Street Chicago, IL","1107 W Fulton St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8865819, -87.65489029999999, 0.0)",41.8865819,-87.65489029999999,0.0,2019

11:00 AM",A New York investment firm is asking $20 million for a trio of courtyard apartment buildings it bought and gut-renovated in South Shore last year.,"[""DAX Real Estate managing partners Daniel Hedaya and Max Seibald with 7500 South South Shore DriveA New York investment firm is asking $20 million for a trio of courtyard apartment buildings it bought and gut-renovated in South Shore last year.DAX Real Estate paid just under $11.5 million in January 2018 for three complexes with 208 combined units at 7500 South South Shore Drive, 6916 South Clyde Avenue and 7038 South Chappel Avenue, according to Cook County property records.Starting last year, DAX spent “several million dollars” on a complete overhaul of the three buildings, the largest of which on South Shore Drive had been “very rundown and substantially vacant,” managing partner Daniel Hedaya told The Real Deal on Tuesday.The complex was owned by notorious Logan Square landlord Mark Fishman, records show.6916 South Clyde AvenueNoah Birk and Aaron Sklar of the Kiser Group, one of the busiest multifamily brokerages on the city’s South Side, are marketing the buildings on behalf of DAX.The apartment complexes represent a rare “turnkey investment opportunity” in the lakefront neighborhood, which faces Jackson Park to its north and straddles a Metra rail line, Sklar said.Sklar called the area “one of the most appreciating pockets of the South Side.”Prior to the renovations, the 130-unit building on South Shore Drive was about 65 percent occupied. Today, the three buildings have tenants for about 95 percent of their total units, according to the Kiser Group.The units range from studios to three-bedrooms, now renting between $525 and $1,515 each. Most units are one-bedrooms and rent near $1,000 apiece, Sklar said.None of the buildings are bound by affordability agreements with the city or federal housing regulators, meaning future landlords could raise rents as high as they want.The city’s diverse stock of mid-size apartment buildings has become an especially alluring target for out-of-state investors, who have a harder time finding properties on the East and West Coast that generate quick returns, Birk and Sklar said.Real estate buyers typically look at capitalization rates, which are calculated by dividing the income a property generates by its market value, to measure the ripeness of an investment opportunity. Buildings with rates above 6 percent are rare in cities like New York and Los Angeles.Kiser estimates the combined rate for the three South Side properties around 8.3 percent.7038 South Chappel AvenueThe smaller buildings on Clyde and Chappel are both inside Opportunity Zones, meaning a buyer could reap big tax benefits if they can prove to federal regulators that they’ve made a “substantial improvement” to the value of the properties.It’s an unlikely goal for a pair of buildings that were just renovated, but a new landlord could still end up being the “passive beneficiary” of a patchwork of zones that were designated all around them, Sklar said.South Shore logged a median home sale price of $100,000 last month, nearly double its $56,000 median in April 2016, according to Redfin. It’s one of several South Side neighborhoods that recently have found themselves in the crosshairs of single-family home flippers.Along with neighboring Woodlawn, South Shore is seeing a surge of interest thanks to its proximity to the planned Obama Presidential Center, whose future remains in flux amid a pending lawsuit.The spiking home values have led some activists to raise alarms over the potential for long-time residents to be priced out of the area. Freshman Alderman Jeanette Taylor (20th), whose ward includes Woodlawn, campaigned this year on softening the forces of gentrification in the predominantly African-American neighborhood.But Birk said he doesn’t expect the listed apartments to ruffle any feathers among neighbors. Even after the renovations, most units in the buildings are priced at levels geared toward the “working class demographic” of South Shore, the broker said.“There’s a lack of very nice affordable housing on the South Side in general,” Birk said. “These buildings were beaten up and worn down a few years ago, and they were renovated to the level where people actually want to live in them.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",7500 South South Shore Drive,A New York, investment firm is asking $20 million for a trio of courtyard apartment buildings it bought and gut-renovated in South Shore last year.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/05/22/new-york-investor-asking-20m-for-apartments-in-appreciating-south-shore/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A New York</a> investment firm is asking $20 million for a trio of courtyard apartment buildings it bought and gut-renovated in South Shore last year.","7500 South South Shore Drive Chicago, IL","7500 S South Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60649, USA","(41.7604042, -87.5572455, 0.0)",41.7604042,-87.5572455,0.0,2019

Oak Street for an undisclosed price, just months after original buyer ESG Kullen was slated to close on the condo, according to Crain’s. Strategic finalized the deal in March, the outlet reported.Though it’s unclear when Strategic entered into negotiations, Crain’s reports that New York-based ESG Kullen had pushed back its scheduled closing date multiple times.ESG Kullen had initially agreed to buy the asset in the summer for $92 million, among the largest condo deconversion deals in city history.But large condo deconversions are expected to taper down in Chicago this year. The city passed an ordinance last year that 85 percent of condo owners had to agree to a takeover, up from the prior 75 percent. And although rental units are a better investment these days, deconversion deals are complicated and fraught with headaches.Strategic has been among the few highly-active shoppers in recent months. Apart from its contract buy at 2 E. Oak, it recently acquired a large Streeterville apartment complex last month for an undisclosed amount (the building was listed for $160 million). Strategic has deconverted three condo buildings in Chicago, including a $44 million deal at 21 E.

What followed was not an overview of the $6 billion project, but an update on the firm’s efforts to boost diversity in its ranks.","[""Sterling Bay’s “People” webpage from last month versus the webpage nowAbout 10 minutes into a three-hour City Council zoning committee hearing on Sterling Bay’s plan for Lincoln Yards, senior counsel Shelly Burke took to the microphone. What followed was not an overview of the $6 billion project, but an update on the firm’s efforts to boost diversity in its ranks.Burke, the company’s newly-appointed director of community engagement and diversity compliance, described the developer’s new training and hiring programs she said would “create workforce opportunities for all of Chicago.” The only African-American executive out of 28 listed company leaders, Burke spoke as Sterling Bay principals Andy Gloor and Dean Marks, who are both white, sat at the front of the council chamber listening.Afterward, Alderman David Moore (17th) questioned Gloor about the timing of Sterling Bay’s decision to add Burke and five other women to the company’s web page listing executives. He noted it happened only after three members of the Community Development Commission publicly mentioned that 19 of the 21 photos posted on the site’s “Senior Leadership” page were of white men.Moore held up two poster boards showing the difference, prompting Gloor to defend the change.“The reformatting doesn’t change that these people have all been part of Sterling Bay for a number of years,” Gloor said. “They are the most senior individuals with their particular expertise, and that has not changed.”The tense exchange highlighted a persistent challenge the Sterling Bay has faced during the project’s punishing eight-month public approval process that began last summer: Demonstrating that a private real estate company, whose leaders mirror an overwhelmingly white and male-dominated industry, deserves to benefit from a $1.3 billion tax increment financing district\xa0bolstered by taxpayers in a diverse city.The TIF district has not yet been approved by the City Council. But a zoning change for the project advanced through the committee last week, lining up Sterling Bay’s 54-acre master plan for final passage by the council Wednesday. The development is slated to build up to 6,000 apartments and 6 million square feet of commercial and hotel space.Though one of the city’s largest developers, Sterling Bay is hardly the only real estate firm led predominantly by white men. The leadership pages for major developers in Chicago like Hines, CIM Group and McCaffery Interests are all filled mostly with white, male faces.And in an industry composed mostly of privately-owned companies whose hiring practices lean hard on personal relationships, few companies are motivated to upset the status quo, said Megan Abraham, executive director of the Goldie Initiative, a nonprofit aimed at elevating women in commercial real estate.“Until companies are publicly owned, the issue of diversity generally doesn’t emerge, because there’s just no mandate to change,” Abraham said. “The people making decisions are those in leadership, and when that’s a homogenous group of older white men, which is often the case, you’ll find no sense of urgency.”Gloor told Moore during last week’s zoning committee meeting that hiring women- and minority-led contracting firms is “something we’ve consistently done in all our projects in Chicago.” It is also mandated under city code for any new development seeking financial backing from the city.Sterling Bay has faced relentless public scrutiny over Lincoln Yards since last summer, including over how it hires contractors the development. Executives met with critical city officials like Moore, who ultimately voted to approve the zoning change last week.Days before a Feb. 15 Community Development Commission hearing to approve the new tax increment financing request, Sterling Bay published a three-page “diversity and inclusion program statement.” The company has spent the past six months building and sharpening the company-wide plan, a spokesperson said.The statement describes sponsorships in training and mentoring programs and lists members of an “advisory council for diversity and inclusion” who will consult the company on Lincoln Yards. Burke said the advisory council will help Sterling Bay “reach out to all parts of Chicago” to find contractors to work in Lincoln Yards, and will promote from within the firm to help it stand out in an industry “that has been dominated by white males.”The firm also promoted Burke to the position of “director of community engagement and diversity compliance” after she personally asked Dean Marks to consider her for the position, she told the Community Development Commission last month. She was one of five women who had the word “director” added to their titles on the website since last month.But in the fall, Sterling Bay lost a woman director in Erin Lavin Cabonargi, who stepped down as head of development to start her own development and consulting firms. Her position was filled by a man.At the zoning committee meeting, Moore ended his questioning by telling Gloor and other Sterling Bay principals to expect the same scrutiny from the city in the future over its hiring practices. That will be especially true, he said, after the April 2 runoff election, when either Toni Preckwinkle or Lori Lightfoot will become the next mayor, marking a milestone for Chicago.“I think we must continue to make sure we have racial diversity at all levels, not just in the project but at the company level as well,” Moore said. “Because let’s not forget, there’s going to be a new sheriff in town here soon, and that sheriff is going to be an African-American woman.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","28 listed company leaders, Burke spoke as St",About 10 minutes," into a three-hour City Council zoning committee hearing on Sterling Bay’s plan for Lincoln Yards, senior counsel Shelly Burke took to the microphone.

07:46 PM","Alderman Walter Burnett (27th) cruised to victory against real estate broker Cynthia Bednarz on Tuesday in his bid for a seventh term representing the eclectic 27th ward, which spans a huge chunk of the city’s Near West Side including the exploding Fulton Market district.","[""Alderman Walter Burnett and Chicago’s Fulton Market neighborhoodAlderman Walter Burnett (27th) cruised to victory against real estate broker Cynthia Bednarz on Tuesday in his bid for a seventh term representing the eclectic 27th ward, which spans a huge chunk of the city’s Near West Side including the exploding Fulton Market\xa0district.With 96 percent of precincts reporting Tuesday evening, Burnett led with about 70 percent of the vote.Burnett launched his political career in the Cabrini-Green area at the northeast edge of the U-shaped ward, but he’s spent the past decade shaping the hundreds of millions of dollars in new development coalescing into a new business district in Fulton Market.Through eight years as a close ally of Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the 55-year-old alderman has helped channel public dollars into landmark projects like the Morgan CTA Pink and Green Line station, which opened in 2012 and laid the foundation for Sterling Bay to build Google’s Midwest headquarters at 1K Fulton.Developers like Sterling Bay, Shapack Partners and Thor Equities have since built or proposed more than 1 million square feet of office and retail space within a few blocks of the station, all thanks to zoning changes approved by Burnett.His ward also spans half of the wealthy Old Town neighborhood on the Near North Side, as well as the River West area, where Burnett shepherded Tribune Media’s 37-acre River District mega-development through the public approval process last year.But the aldermen has also taken steps to check the pace of new development. In 2017, he sponsored an expansion of the Affordability Requirements Ordinance that created zones where developers must promise reduced rents on at least 20 percent of their proposed units in order to score higher zoning for any new development.The ordinance was intended “carve out a little piece for school teachers” to be able to afford the neighborhood, where most new apartments now rent for more than $4 per square foot, Burnett told The Real Deal in October. But some developers have lashed out at the new rule, saying it made new construction harder to finance.Still, the ordinance hasn’t stopped builders and architects from paying to beef up his political operation. Real estate groups pumped more than $160,000 into Burnett’s campaign since the beginning of last year, records show.His re-election Tuesday instantly makes him one of the most senior and influential members of the City Council, where a wave of retiring aldermen with more than 100 years of combined experience will make way for a sea of younger faces.So far, Burnett’s name has not surfaced in any of the criminal allegations swarming around veteran aldermen like Ed Burke (14th), Danny Solis (25th) and Ricardo Munoz (22nd), leaving him without a direct public tie to the web of scandals consuming City Hall.And Burnett faced a smoother path to re-election than other longtime council members who have bonded themselves to Emanuel, like Aldermen Pat O’Connor (40th) and Joe Moore (49th), who faced fierce challenges.Burnett out-raised Bednarz during the last year by a 66-to-1 margin.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2012 and laid the foundation for St,Alderman Walter," Burnett (27th) cruised to victory against real estate broker Cynthia Bednarz on Tuesday in his bid for a seventh term representing the eclectic 27th ward, which spans a huge chunk of the city’s Near West Side including the exploding Fulton Market district.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/02/26/alderman-walter-burnett-chicago-election-2019/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Alderman Walter</a> Burnett (27th) cruised to victory against real estate broker Cynthia Bednarz on Tuesday in his bid for a seventh term representing the eclectic 27th ward, which spans a huge chunk of the city’s Near West Side including the exploding Fulton Market district.","2012 and laid the foundation for St Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2019

The new development includes 299 apartments and 80,000-square-feet of retail, among it an Amazon Fresh store.Dubbed District 1860 to honor Abraham Lincoln’s election year, the development is estimated to cost about $175 million. To get all parties to agree to the project, Lincolnwood approved subsidies from part of the property and sales tax revenues generated from it.For half a century, the site was home to the Purple Hotel, which started out as an up-scale Hyatt with live entertainers like Barry Manilow and later became a seedy meeting place for “swingers” events and drug-fueled parties. Tired of the frequent commotion and police calls, the village of Lincolnwood shut it down in 2007. Court battles delayed demolition until 2013.The project was further delayed when Tucker’s original hotel partner walked away from the deal as demand for suburban lodging dwindled during the pandemic. Lakhani Hospitality came on board and reworked the design to reduce the number of rooms to 150 and divide it between the two operators.The village of Lincolnwood pledged up to $3.4 million, which will come from the village’s hotel tax, to Lakhani for construction costs.

But Hazel Crest could help the Calumet Country Club’s new owners pick up the pieces with a redevelopment and annexation plan.Mayor Vernard Alsberry said no formal request has been made for the land just west of his village’s town line, but he is waiting for an official annexation proposal, the Daily Southtown reported. The 130-acre property, located at 2136 175th Street in unincorporated Cook County, separated from the village of Homewood in April 2021.Arizona-based Diversified Partners spent $3.3 million for the golf course in 2020. Diversified broke it off with Homewood after village officials rejected plans to redevelop the property into an 800,000-square-foot warehouse facility. Residents were outraged by the potential impacts of increased traffic and lower property values.Grassroots organization South Suburbs for Greenspace released documents that show Hazel Crest is considering a redevelopment plan that could include a hotel, water park, warehouses or retail space.Alsberry said village officials have been in discussions with Catalyst Consulting, which is pitching a mixed-use development without a large collection of warehouses — a point of importance for Alsberry, who suggested he doesn’t want trucks moving in and out of the village.A development the size Catalyst is proposing would need to secure water and sewer connections from the Hazel Crest. Critics cite this as being one reason the property isn’t ideal for redevelopment.\nVillage attorney John Murphey said the property owners will likely request a tax increment financing (TIF) district, a long process that would involve the village hiring outside consultants first. The village could be reimbursed by the developer for the costs related to the TIF, according to Murphey.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2136 175th Street,Breaking up is hard, to do.

The family-owned developer has had an office in the building since 2016 but will take an unspecified amount of additional space to accommodate the relocation.In making the move, Tucker said it wanted to concentrate in one of the city’s most booming neighborhoods, an area where the firm is focusing more of its development efforts.It is also just the latest suburban company to move its operations to Fulton Market, which has the most in-demand office space in the city. Fulton Market has also become increasingly crowded with developer headquarters. Sterling Bay sold its headquarters building this summer for $175 million, the priciest office sale of the year. McCaffery Interests has moved its headquarters to its new office building at 1201 West Lake Street.“That momentum, together with our growing portfolio of city projects under management and development, made now the ideal time to concentrate our operations in this central location,” Tucker’s chief investment officer, Aaron Tucker, said in a statement.In 2017, Tucker unveiled its redevelopment of a square block of historic properties in the 900 block of West Randolph Street. The office space is fully leased, and its retail tenants include Lululemon, Bluemercury and Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams.Earlier this year, Tucker sold a stake in the development known as 900 West, with Asana Partners paying $41.6 million for a portion of the property.Tucker did not include in the sale a Peoria Street-facing parcel where it is planning a 495-foot-tall condo project with Related Midwest.The firm is also working on its District 1860 project in Lincolnwood, where it plans a 220-key hotel, 300 apartments, and 70,000 square feet of retail space. It is slated to be delivered in mid-2021, according to Tucker’s website.That development is the source of a lawsuit between the village of Lincolnwood and Lake Forest Real Estate Capital, which accused the village of steering the project towards Tucker.Tucker also partnered with Sears real estate offshoot Seritage Growth Properties on the redevelopment of a former Sears location on the Northwest Side.The firm will continue to manage its former Highland Park headquarters.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",954 West Washington Boulevard,The newest firm, relocating to Fulton Market is one of the neighborhood’s most prominent developers.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/08/20/tucker-development-is-latest-company-to-move-to-fulton-market/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The newest firm</a> relocating to Fulton Market is one of the neighborhood’s most prominent developers.","954 West Washington Boulevard Chicago, IL","954 W Washington Blvd, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8832458, -87.65178379999999, 0.0)",41.8832458,-87.65178379999999,0.0,2019

It also owns a 16,000-square-foot building at 210-216 W. Chicago Ave.If KBS lists the buildings independently from the rest of its portfolio, it could be a signal that loft office buildings in downtown Chicago – with open floor plans and high, wood-beam ceilings favored by financial service firms – remain popular, wrote Crain’s. KBS identified River North as a growth market when it purchased 213 W. Institute Place in 2017, according to a company press release announcing the acquisition.“This acquisition is consistent with KBS’ strategy of targeting growth markets, particularly attractive to high value employees, which we believe 213 West Institute Place will allow us to do,” said Ken Robertson, regional president with KBS, in a release at the time of the purchase. “These growth trends also provide value for investors as companies continue to compete for top talent.”KBS initially announced plans to liquidate in August 2020 as a result of the pandemic and civil unrest in Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, where much of its real estate portfolio is located, Crain’s reported. Those plans were put on hold as investor demand for properties softened, but have been set in motion now, after the value of its assets fell by about a third since 2020.KBS Growth & Income REIT is an affiliate of KBS Capital Advisors, which owns the Accenture Tower at 500 W.

It bought the property from the DiFoggio family, which owns DiFoggio Plumbing & Sewer Contractors.Vancouver-based Onni Group was in advanced talks in March to buy the 190,000-square-foot site at 901 North Halsted Street, at the southern tip of Goose Island, Crain’s reported at the time. The deal would be for $50 million and up to 1,000 apartments would be built.Long dominated by industrial plants and warehouses, the 160-acre Goose Island was rezoned to accommodate more retail and office uses as part of the city’s 2017 North Branch Framework plan. Residential development on the island remains off-limits under the new zoning layout — except on the island’s southeast corner, the site of Greyhound’s property.Still, any large residential development would likely require another zoning change. The property is part of an affordable housing “pilot zone” established last November that would require at least 20 percent of units to be rented below market rate.R2 Companies, one of the most active property owners on Goose Island, moved its headquarters in June to a rehabbed office building overlooking the Chicago River near Division Street.Also in June, Onni Group rolled out a proposal for a 356-unit apartment tower at 353 West Grand Avenue in River North.

He said the hold was eventually lifted, but the owner is still going through the permitting process and a renovation permit hasn’t been issued yet.After outcry by the city and housing advocates, the building’s owner came up with a relocation plan for current residents, giving them an option for them to return. But tenants are worried the units will become unaffordable when renovations are complete.Cedar Realty agreed to delay the move-out date until Nov. 1, but the city still wants more time, saying the company created a situation where tenants are “verging on panic and a dread of homelessness.”Citywide, the inventory of affordable housing has been declining for decades.

The design would close off Randolph’s unique side access roads to car traffic, creating more pedestrian space. Several community members raised concerns the plan could choke traffic in the busy restaurant and nightlife district.Related Midwest is also proposing a 58-story tower slated to include an Equinox hotel just a few blocks to the east — a project that would be the tallest building yet in the neighborhood.The developers said they are targeting a 2019 groundbreaking at 900 West Randolph, with about a two-year timetable for construction.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",900 West Randolph Street,Sometimes less is, the same.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/03/28/related-tucker-propose-shortening-fulton-market-high-rise/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Sometimes less is</a> the same.","900 West Randolph Street Chicago, IL","900 W Randolph St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8846414, -87.650213, 0.0)",41.8846414,-87.650213,0.0,2018

Kimberly-Clark, Tock, Calamos Investments and Tik Tok signed onto the space in the neighborhood. But with offices implementing work from home policies especially with the Delta strain of COVID-19, the downtown office market vacancy rate hit nearly 20 percent in the second quarter.Earlier this year, CBRE predicted Chicago’s vacancy rates could surge above 20 percent if projects under construction don’t lure new tenants.Developers are also planning to bring residential projects to the West Loop area.

The proposal at 160 North Morgan Street will also spare 10 percent of its units for affordable units on site.

The latest figure is higher than the 18.6 percent rate in the third quarter of 2020.Firms in Chicago signed leases for 2.2 million square feet of space in the third quarter, the most since the pandemic.“I would characterize it as tenant musical chairs,” said Eric Feinberg, vice chairman and co-head for the Chicago region at Savills. “When you are moving from one building to another, you’re not changing availability that much. It’s not like pre-pandemic where you’re having organic expansion of jobs or industry in Chicago.”Quarterly leasing was led by Kirkland & Ellis’s signing of 600,000 square feet at the Salesforce Tower, relocating from the 500,000 square feet office space at 300 North LaSalle Drive. Kraft Heinze also renewed its 162,000 square feet at Aon Center.Savills’ Feinberg also attributed the high vacancy rate to offices trying to figure out work-from-home arrangements as uncertainty still lingers over the coronavirus.“There hasn’t been complete certainty as to what those policies are going to be. There is definitely uncertainty around what those are and how those [work-from-home policies] are going to affect leasing decisions going forward,” said Feinberg.Overall gross asking rents nevertheless ticked upward, increasing 0.7 percent to $40.70 per square foot this quarter. Asking rents for Class A properties drove up the overall market, with Class A building rents increasing by 1.2 percent to $46.63 per square foot. Tenant demand for amenities and upgraded building facilities at Class A properties remain high while effective rents declined precipitously in Class B buildings.North Michigan Avenue had the lowest vacancy rate of 15.9 percent in the quarter while the Far West Loop and Fulton Market had the highest, at 25.5 percent. Savills attributed the high rate at the West Loop and Fulton Market to new developments.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",300 North LaSalle Drive,More than one fifth, of the office space in downtown Chicago remains available as companies try to figure out their work-from-home policies.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/10/04/office-leasing-in-downtown-chicago-hits-record-but-more-than-20-remained-available-in-q3/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">More than one fifth</a> of the office space in downtown Chicago remains available as companies try to figure out their work-from-home policies.","300 North LaSalle Drive Chicago, IL","300 N La Salle St, Chicago, IL 60654, USA","(41.8880993, -87.6327417, 0.0)",41.8880993,-87.6327417,0.0,2021

08:15 AM",Michael Reschke is tired of rehashing his past — and what a past it’s been.,"[""Michael Reschke (Photo by Matt Haas)Michael Reschke is tired of rehashing his past — and what a past it’s been.The veteran developer was once chairman of three public companies, including the nation’s largest mall owner, before experiencing a tumultuous period that saw his exit from Prime Group Realty Trust’s office empire following a memorable clash with Steve Roth. Then Reschke came up short with a bid to take back the Prime office holdings after David Lichtenstein’s Lightstone Group made a winning offer.Yet 20 years later, at 66, the Houdini of Chicago real estate is back on top as CEO of the now-separate Prime Group and facing what may be his biggest challenge yet: the $350 million renovation of the 1.2 million-square-foot Helmut Jahn-designed Thompson Center, a gamble on a post-pandemic Loop renaissance amid record office vacancy rates. The only other bidder for the deteriorating state-owned building had proposed demolishing it.Jahn designed a large atrium and open offices to signify transparency in government — a look that also proved the spaceship-shaped building’s downfall. Single-paned glass walls made for poor insulation in both summer and winter, costing taxpayers $17 million annually to operate it. Drainage issues rusted the building’s pillars: Scaffolding frequently engulfed the property as stone cracked and fell.Reschke is undaunted, counting on the state of Illinois’ promise to buy back a third of the building and move the Attorney General’s Office back in. He says he’s already fielding interest from potential tenants who could lease as much as 300,000 square feet, though no pre-leasing has been completed.These days, Reschke shuns the reference to the magician in favor of being compared to Nik Wallenda, who in 2014 set two world records by traversing the Chicago River on a tightrope from the top of the Marina City west tower to the Leo Burnett building and then, blindfolded, walking from one Marina City tower rooftop to the other.“People look at him and say, ‘You’re taking a huge risk, you’re fucking crazy,’” Reschke said in an interview at the Roanoke, his restaurant at the base of his 384-unit Residence Inn at 11 South LaSalle Street. “Well, Wallenda would tell you, ‘I’ve been doing this since I was six months old, and for me, it’s like walking in the park.’”Thompson Center,\xa0 which Reschke intends to keep entirely offices, contrary to previous reports, is just part of his decade-old effort to revive LaSalle Street, the major north-south corridor whose Loop section includes the city’s financial district. He’s trying to convert the “canyon” hemmed in by former financial institutions into a lively tourism destination with apartments and rejuvenated workplaces.Urban experts convened by the city have urged the conversion of offices into housing. The cost may be prohibitive, they acknowledge, and new development across the river in the West Loop — specifically Fulton Market — is a growing threat for landlords seeking tenants for top-tier offices or new apartments.“There is going to be a time and place for people to embrace Mike’s vision of a renaissance, but I wouldn’t want to be the first person to bet on it,” said West Loop and Fulton Market developer Philip Denny.Reschke’s Thompson Center project has sparked recollections of his big appetite for risk and his ability to wriggle out of skirmishes with lenders and competitors. He’s in the midst of closing a deal right now to resolve a $50 million battle with a lender.“I don’t want to delude the significance and importance of what we’re doing today with anything from 20 years ago,” he said. “Right now, I’m interested in the renaissance that’s going to happen with Chicago.”In addition to reviving the Thompson Center, Reschke will raise his wager if he closes on a $191 million loan against nearby connected 37-story and 23-story office buildings along Monroe Street that face LaSalle and Clark streets.He hopes to pay a discount to the loan’s face value, giving him funding to enliven the LaSalle Street portion, where 900,000 square feet was left vacant by the exits of BMO Harris Bank and law firm Chapman & Cutler for the new BMO Tower on Canal Street. The mostly empty building left its owner, a venture of South Korea’s Samsung Life Insurance, and lender Union Bank in jeopardy. Reschke plans to convert part of the Clark Street portion’s upper floors into as many as 500 apartments.The developer also plans to bid for the soon-to-be mostly vacant former Bank of America building next door to the former BMO building if, as many expect, owner AmTrust hands it back to its lender. He’s counting on success with those properties as well as The LaSalle, a 234-room luxury hotel at 208 South LaSalle converted from offices on five floors above his 610-room JW Marriott hotel, a project he touts as having “spurred the revolution of bringing people back to downtown 24-7.”Another venture Reschke leads has also signed an agreement to resolve a $50 million foreclosure attempt by Midland National Life Insurance on other office floors at the building, and he plans to refinance the space in the “very near future.” He’s confident he’ll hold onto it and convert it into 280 apartments, which he said will lease “like popcorn” to residents attracted by the amenities and services associated with the hotels.“For me it’s not a risk, because I do it. I know how to do it,” Reschke said. “The timing couldn’t be better to buy buildings. I’ve been in business over 40 years. I’ve never seen values this low.”Reschke’s willing to give projects some extra time to blossom before calling it quits, just as he did for his son, who signed a contract promising to maintain a B average or better at the University of Colorado in Boulder instead of aiming for the Naval Academy, as his father had hoped. The son turned in a single B-minus as a freshman, but Reschke let him stay another year, after which he transferred to St. Regis University in Denver.Reschke graduated in 1972 from Arlington High School in Chicago’s northwest suburbs, working from the age of 16 as a tile setter for his father’s small business. He majored in accounting at Northern Illinois University and received a law degree from the University of Illinois Law School, shifting to real estate after stints at Arthur Andersen and Winston & Strawn.He’s still focused on details: While touring the 21st floor of 208 South LaSalle, where a crew of workers was putting the finishing touches on the hotel lobby and bar, he marveled at the African eucalyptus wood finishes before griping to a contractor that a door behind a lobby desk wasn’t closing smoothly.“I’ve always been on construction sites,” Reschke said.He’s also got a knack for overcoming poor timing. Reschke started the JW Marriott project just as the Great Recession was crushing financial markets.“What Mike did with the JW Marriott is plant a very high-end flag of over 600 rooms in the heart of the Loop when there were a lot of skeptics,” said Rich Curto, a former partner of Reschke’s at Prime Group before the Steve Roth ordeal. “The JW Marriott was a classic case of people suggesting that maybe that wasn’t a good thing to do, but if you look at it, it was effectively successful even though there was a downturn in the economy.”Shortly after Reschke moved the project forward, two more luxury hotels — the Kimpton Gray and Hyatt Centric — opened on Monroe, just off LaSalle. “They followed me,” he said.He remains dismissive about rivals. “They’re all jealous,” he said. “They don’t understand risk like I do.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",17 million annually to operate it.

12:05 PM","When the late Nancy Hughes’ home in Lake Forest came on the market in August for $15 million, it was yet another sign of how well the city’s luxury market was performing. The home had previously sold for $12 million in 2018, with the new list price representing a 25 percent increase.","[""263 N Mayflower Rd, Lake Forest (Zillow, Getty)When the late Nancy Hughes’ home in Lake Forest came on the market in August for $15 million, it was yet another sign of how well the city’s luxury market was performing. The home had previously sold for $12 million in 2018, with the new list price representing a 25 percent increase.But when the home finally closed last week after months under contract, the final price was $12.9 million — significantly closer to its last sale price than the ask.Chicago’s luxury market continues to perform well when measured by deal volume, but what happened at the Lake Forest home isn’t uncommon. Plenty of the city’s biggest richest home sales included steep cuts from their listing prices, meaning many sellers had to shave millions off their asking price to get a deal done.Rafael Murillo, with RM Luxury Group at Compass, secured a 29 percent decrease from the list price when he repped the buyer of a downtown condo in what he called the “deal of the century.”His client purchased the River North condo at 676 N Kingsbury Street for $1.6 million, after it was listed for $2.25 million and had previously sold in 2017 for $2.1 million, marking a significant loss for the sellers during a sluggish downtown condo market.Murillo said his first step in submitting an offer is a call with the seller’s agent to learn more about the sellers, the previous offers they’ve had on the house, and how quickly they need to move.“You can use this information to your advantage by accommodating their closing needs, but offering less than you would to meet their timeline,” he said. “I have no problem submitting a low offer and encouraging the listing agent to provide a counter offer.”The trend isn’t just seen on some luxury deals, but often the one’s at the very top. This year’s priciest deals, including the $20 million Trump Tower Chicago penthouse sale that was cut from a $30 million list price, have undergone substantial shaves. In the Gold Coast, a 10,000-square-foot Beaux-Arts style mansion sold for $7 million, almost half the $13.5 million asking price when it was listed two years ago.The same trend is happening in the North Shore’s suburbs, where a $16 million listing of a century-old lakefront mansion eventually closed for $12.75 million. In August, a six-bedroom, 11,600-square-foot Lake Forest home, known as “La Vieille Maison” hit the market in March 2021 with an asking price of $10.5 million, before it closed on August 1 for $7.5 million. In September, a 6,000-square-foot home in Lake Forest sold for $5 million after originally being listed in May for $6.8 million.The price cuts don’t mean the luxury market has slowed down, however. Within the city limits, 66 sales closed at $4 million or more last year, according to the Chicago Association of Realtors — that’s the price benchmark the group considers ultra-luxury properties. Through September, there have been 48 such sales in 2022, putting this year only slightly behind last year’s pace by four sales, or a 7 percent dip.Murillo said his approach was specific to the downtown condo market, a point of weakness in Chicago’s otherwise healthy luxury sector. He said notable exceptions to the condo market’s weak pricing include No 9 Walton, One Chicago, St Regis and Tribune Tower.“I find that negotiations work out better when the buyer offers a higher price the second time around but moves less during each counter which gets to the seller’s bottom dollar before you get to your buyer’s top dollar,” Murillo said. “Slow and steady wins the race for negotiations.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",263 N Mayflower Rd,When the late Nancy," Hughes’ home in Lake Forest came on the market in August for $15 million, it was yet another sign of how well the city’s luxury market was performing.

Wells Fargo provided the previous loan, property records indicate.Onni’s apartment building at 1140 North Wells Street opened in April and includes a penthouse unit that rents for $45,000 a month, making it the priciest rental property in Chicago. The 4,200-square-foot apartment spans two floors and comes with a private pool, a hot tub and an outdoor shower.Rents for the remaining units range from $2,000 to $4,000.Onni is working to build the next two phases of its massive Old Town Park project.In December, the firm secured a $125 million construction loan from Wells Fargo for the second phase of its project, a 39-story, 428-unit rental tower. The building was already under construction in December.The approval process for Onni’s planned third tower in the project hit a bump late last year. After neighbors said that Onni had backed out of a pledge to include 20 percent affordable housing in each phase of its development, the city’s Plan Commission deadlocked on a measure to approve the third tower. It is unclear if the project, set to include 456 units in a 41-story building, has been approved.The Old Town Park project is the redevelopment of the former Atrium Village housing complex and will include the rehabbing of an Atrium building that was constructed in the 1970s.A representative for the firm did not immediately return a request for comment.Onni Group, one of LA’s biggest developers, is also building a 41-story apartment tower in River North.

In moving downtown it would join a growing list of suburban companies uprooting from the suburbs for the city or opening an outpost in the city to attract young talent.After landing a $97.2 million construction loan, Rosemont-based White Oak and Chicago-based CA Office in 2016 began building the 438,000-square foot tower on spec, hoping to cash in on the robust downtown office market. But the building, one of two large office projects to come online this year, has sat empty since it opened.The developers hired Newmark Knight Frank earlier this year to lease up the building.White Oak, meanwhile, is turning its attention to residential projects in the West Loop, where it plans to build a 273-unit apartment tower at 205 South Peoria Street and a 205-unit building at 111 South Peoria.Ferrara signed a 10-year lease at 1 Tower Lane in Oakbrook Terrace in 2012 after it was bought by private equity firm Catterton Partners, which merged it with another confectionary company in its portfolio, Farley’s & Sathers Candy Company.

The complex has become the preferred residence of employees and graduate students of nearby Northwestern Memorial Hospital and Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine.Maryland-based MEPT listed the property for sale in 2019, promoting it as an “affordable, amenity-rich living experience in a neighborhood dominated by newer luxury high-rise towers,” according to market material at the time.But the property didn’t sell and BentallGreenOak negotiated a new 99-year ground lease on the 25 percent of the land MEPT didn’t own — the remaining portion belongs to descendants of bookseller Andrew C.

He then used his grandson’s company, 9C LLC to purchase $734,428 of the owed taxes for Mako Properties Inc. for a price tag of $5,650. This covered taxes owed on five of the seven properties the 77-year-old owns through his companies.His method of avoiding tax payments and then using another one of his companies to buy out the taxes has been used on seven properties. They are: 15825 and 15827 Dixie Highway, Harvey;1415 E. 142nd St., Dolton; 1869 Sibley Blvd., Calumet City; 13825 Park Ave., Dolton; 420 E. 142nd St., Dolton; 606 E. 142nd St., Dolton.Nitchoff used another one of his companies, B. Hartman Group, to pay off more taxes on two of the properties. He paid just $20,630 to buy the $126,583 owed. Unfortunately for him, his tactics violate state law and Nitchoff apparently knows it.“We thought about it — because the company is under different companies, different owners, it’s not the owner of deed,” he told the Sun-Times. “In a way, it could be legal. But I just didn’t want to create problems for the boys and me.”Records show that even after purchasing the $861,000 in taxes that they have failed to pay property taxes on all of the seven properties which totals to $1.68 million.The Nitchoff family has won tens of millions of dollars in public contracts to soundproof homes near O’Hare and Midway airports, and to rehab porches and roofs for low-income homeowners across the city.Nitchoff and his two sons, Alex nitchoff and Constantino Nitchoff, were named in a federal search warrant related to Ald. Carrie Austin and her chief of staff, Chester Wilson.

It was at least the sixth time Realty Income has bought a store branded by the upscale grocer since 2017.In suburban Glenview, Arizona’s Nottinghill Gate Tucson paid Chicago’s Inland Real Estate $18 million for a 64,000-square-foot Jewel-Osco grocery at 1340 Patriot Boulevard.The deals underscore the relative safety of food stores compared with the challenge of trying to fill storefronts on high-end urban shopping strips such as Chicago’s Magnificent Mile and State Street. It isn’t just Illinois: Two South Florida sales for a combined $57 million this month helped ignite interest in retail from investors seeking a steady cash flow, The Real Deal reported.Neither the buyers nor the sellers on the Chicago sales responded to requests for comment. The South Loop deal provided a margin of almost 30 percent above Melohn’s 2014 purchase price, and Jewel sold for 40 percent more than its 2017 price, public record show.The sales came as about a quarter of the Mag Mile’s retail space stands empty and landlords and city leaders mull how to turn around the pandemic-battered strip.This spring, Brixmor bought a suburban Whole Foods for $26 million, or $257 a square foot. Since then the firm upped its bet on grocery centers by paying $75 million for Elmhurst Crossing and $60 million for North Riverside Plaza.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1340 Patriot Blvd and 1625 South Clark St,The humble grocery," store market, a mainstay for real estate investors throughout the pandemic, is prospering in Chicago, where two properties just sold for a combined $70 million.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/06/24/grocery-frenzy-still-alive-in-chicago-with-70m-of-sales/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The humble grocery</a> store market, a mainstay for real estate investors throughout the pandemic, is prospering in Chicago, where two properties just sold for a combined $70 million.","1340 Patriot Blvd and 1625 South Clark St Chicago, IL","1625 S Clark St, Chicago, IL 60616, USA","(41.859366, -87.62966519999999, 0.0)",41.859366,-87.62966519999999,0.0,2022

It is one of the largest apartment buildings to be put up for sale since the pandemic started. A deal could signal renewed optimism in Chicago’s commercial real estate market.So far, investors have backed away from buying or selling properties in Chicago’s downtown core because of uncertainty around pricing and demand for space.Halsted Flats was constructed in 2014 and is one of the few new luxury apartments in the area. It first hit the market in October 2018 when Chicago’s rental market was red hot and developers were converting their condos to rentals. The developers never found a buyer.Halsted Flats is about 91 percent occupied. Its average unit rental price was $2.93 per square foot in the third quarter, according to CoStar.The developers financed the project with a $58.5 million construction loan and then refinanced it with a $72.5 million loan in 2015. The developers told the city in 2012 it would cost $73.4 million to build.JDL is one of Chicago’s most active residential developers. Its other projects include One Chicago in River North. It also recently released plans for North Union, a 2,680-unit megadevelopment on River North that could be the city’s largest development project in 20 years.[Crains] — Keith LarsenAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",3740 North Halsted Street,A luxury apartment," building near Wrigley Field is on the market for the second time in two years, now with an asking price of $125 million.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2020/12/16/luxury-building-near-wrigley-field-hits-market-for-125m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A luxury apartment</a> building near Wrigley Field is on the market for the second time in two years, now with an asking price of $125 million.","3740 North Halsted Street Chicago, IL","3740 N Halsted St, Chicago, IL 60613, USA","(41.950587, -87.6497995, 0.0)",41.950587,-87.6497995,0.0,2020

There are only two four-bedroom condos on the market in Lakeview today, according to Redfin, and they top out at $1.6 million.“Condos of that size are very desirable,” said Federici, whose partners on the project are Jefferson Offutt and William Fisher — both former KRAIN agents. Fisher, who also sells for Compass, will co-list the units with Federici.Federici is funding the project with a $4.8 million construction loan from Renovo Financial, which records show closed last week. He bought the property — currently a red-brick house — in 2016 for $1.65 million, and his permit application is moving through the city now.KRAIN closed in December when Federici took 11 of his top agents with him to Compass, he said. His new company has no problem with his work on the side.“They encourage us to procure business,” Federici said. “You just need to divulge your ownership interests legally, which we’re always up-front about.”This is not Federici’s first ground-up project. He and his partners also built 10 units at 1018 North Larrabee Street in Old Town, when KRAIN still existed.

In its place, he built a contemporary designer home, almost double the original home’s size, at 5,000 square feet, according to the Tribune.Ricketts’ attorney said that Ricketts’s missteps were “a series of good faith miscommunications” with no attempt to deceive.

Earlier this year, McKinley Park was named the hottest affordable neighborhood in the United States by Redfin.“We were looking for historic rehab opportunities,” Code managing partner Jared Remington said of his firm’s first project in Chicago. “We love the location by the park. We feel this is the next neighborhood to really get hot.”Code’s plans call for redeveloping the 180,000-square-foot structure at 2159 West Pershing Road into 130 apartments, many of which would be affordable and income-restricted.At 2139 West Pershing, Code plans about 120,000 square feet of commercial space, which could accommodate a co-working office or even light manufacturing uses, Remington said. The building also would house 30 market-rate apartments. Plans call for 145 parking spaces and green roof features, according to the rezoning request.Code, which specializes in affordable and historic redevelopments, will seek to keep as many of the buildings’ original features as possible, including windows, interior beams and other features, Remington said.“There’s good bones,” he said of the structures. “We’re going to keep the historic character.”The $63 million project primarily would be financed through public funding mechanisms, including the use of historic tax credits, new market tax credits and low income housing tax credits, Remington said.Code is hoping to begin work by the end of the year.The project would be the latest in the ongoing redevelopment of the Central Manufacturing District.Aberdeen Development already is working to redevelop the buildings at 2055 and 2133 West Pershing Road into office space, according to Crain’s.

Schaefer had bought that four-story, 35,000-square-foot building for $1.3 million in 2010.Schaefer had remained a tenant of the Madison building as Feil became its landlord for several years, and then downsized with its move into the McCaffrey building. Other tenants have made similar moves to shrink their real estate footprints while moving into Fulton Market spaces considered higher quality to Chicago’s older office buildings in the Loop and West Loop.Another marketing firm made a similar deal this year to Schaefer’s 2018 sale to Feil. Chicago-based AgencyEA cashed in with a sale of the 41,000 square foot River North property at 311 West Walton Street for $14.4 million to a Spanish investor, and leased back the office building to remain its tenant. The deal more than tripled the $4.6 million AgencyEA paid for the building in 2014.Back in Fulton Market, Schaefer will join Coca-Cola, Bissell, Datassential and ServiceNow as a tenant in the McCaffery-managed property. Craig Coupe of JLL brokered the deal for Schafer to move into the seven-story building, which is branded as Twelve01West.Coupe told the outlet that Twelve01West, which was completed in 2019, has a penthouse-level wellness center, indoor and outdoor rooftop space and 20,000 total square feet of outdoor hangouts.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",176 North Racine Avenue,A creative, advertising agency is moving into the Fulton Market District after selling its former offices for a windfall.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/11/10/advertising-firm-moves-into-fulton-market-district/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A creative</a> advertising agency is moving into the Fulton Market District after selling its former offices for a windfall.","176 North Racine Avenue Chicago, IL","176 N Racine Ave, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.88520190000001, -87.65695219999999, 0.0)",41.88520190000001,-87.65695219999999,0.0,2022

One landlord in particular, M. Fishman & Co., has become a target of the anti-gentrification movement, though other landlords say Fishman’s rents are in line with what other property owners are charging.The rising prices in the neighborhood were one of the main factors behind a growing effort to push for statewide rent control, though so far there’s been little movement on it in Springfield.WBEZ radio found that Logan Square’s Latino population fell by more than 20,000 from 2012 to 2017, while the white population surged by 12,000.

The Chicago Auto Show is also returning to McCormick Place, the first major event to open at the convention space since the virus took hold. And Lollapalooza will once again rock out in Grant Park.But despite the note of hope, the latest numbers also sound an alarm: return to normal won’t happen anytime soon.The city’s hard-hit office market is proof of that. About 25 percent of office workers had returned to their desks in June, according to the Loop Alliance, which drew data from security firm Kastle Systems and its own tally of 18 counters along State Street.Since the coronavirus hit, the Chicago office market has seen tenants exit leases, cut space or cancel planned deals. Central Loop office availability hit a record high of 25.3 percent in the second quarter, according to Colliers. Citywide, office vacancy rose to 17 percent. Some companies began telling workers to return to the office after the July 4 weekend, and others are expected to do so after Labor Day.Loop Alliance CEO Michael Edwards said he believes by the end of summer, about 50 percent of office workers in the Loop will have returned.According to Colliers, “although there is some optimism in the market with a slight uptick in activity compared to last quarter, a return to market ‘health’ is a long way off.”Chicago’s post-pandemic office struggles are similar to other major cities, such as Los Angeles, New York City and San Francisco, according to Kastle Systems.And while more people are moving through the Loop, the 1 million clicks recently registered along State Street is 58 percent below its pre-pandemic volume.The Loop Alliance also reported that bus ridership had ticked up to 45 percent of its usual volume, OpenTable reservations in the city have approached 80 percent of pre-pandemic levels and major Loop hotels have reported a rise in bookings, especially during the July 4 weekend. Rates are also “starting to creep up,” Edwards said.In addition to the auto show that opened today at McCormick Place, the convention center has 119 bookings through the rest of the year. While that’s considered seasonally sluggish, the massive space — along with many others — is still trying to rebound from the pandemic.“Conventions are lagging,” the city’s chief marketing officer, Michael Fassnacht, told the Chicago Sun-Times this week. “But after September, we have strong bookings. And 2022 looks very, very promising.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",18 counters along State Street,Pedestrian counters," on State Street clicked over 1 million times in a single week, a first since the start of the pandemic.

Chinese company Wanda Group had been on board to operate the hotel before it sold its 90 percent stake in the development to Magellan and partners Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan.Magellan announced the new name in late 2020, after securing St. Regis Hotels & Resorts as the new hotel operator.Condos in the tower, which range in price from $1 million to $18.5 million, have been selling at a relatively slow pace. Magellan hasn’t said how many condos in the building have been sold, but Crain’s estimated that 163 units — out of the building’s 353 — have been closed and another 18 are listed as “contract pending.”Back in September, Magellan Development CEO David Carlins paid $6.5 million for a 68th floor unit in the tower. The 5,208-square-foot, four-bedroom unit was listed for $7.8 million.[CCB] — Victoria Pruitt\xa0\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",363 East Wacker Drive,The opening of a, luxury hotel in Chicago’s third-tallest tower has been delayed yet again.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/05/24/st-regis-chicago-hotel-opening-delayed-yet-again/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The opening of a</a> luxury hotel in Chicago’s third-tallest tower has been delayed yet again.","363 East Wacker Drive Chicago, IL","363 E Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL 60601, USA","(41.8874508, -87.61745979999999, 0.0)",41.8874508,-87.61745979999999,0.0,2022

Locals worry the project will spoil the village’s charm.Christine Bending, whose home sits on more than an acre of land, would get about $1 million from Transwestern, says she isn’t going anywhere – especially after finally agreeing to a developer’s offer to buy her former house of 42 years on Bryn Mawr Ave. near Wood Dale. She sold the four-bedroom for $775,000 and moved into a three-bedroom in Medinah.“It was everything that I wanted, and to have it taken away again?” she told the outlet. “God, I just — I don’t get it.”One resident started an online petition to save the residents’ homes. It has more than 2,300 signatures as of Tuesday.Part of Transwestern’s plans would involve annexing the area into the nearby village of Itasca, where Transwestern is scheduled to present its plans to the community development committee on June 28.Itasca Mayor Jeff Pruyn issued a letter in response to the plans, saying no official decision had been made by the village.“While there have been several discussions with staff, village officials, and the developer, Transwestern opted to first share its plans with Medinah area residents before presenting its concept plan to the Itasca Village Board,” he sold the outlet.[DH] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",42 years on Bryn Mawr Ave,“I won’t sell” and, “Save Medinah” placards are sprouting in the unincorporated village just west of O’Hare airport as residents gird to push back against plans to replace a 150-home subdivision with an industrial park.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/06/21/medinah-fights-plans-to-demolish-150-homes-for-industrial-park/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">“I won’t sell” and</a> “Save Medinah” placards are sprouting in the unincorporated village just west of O’Hare airport as residents gird to push back against plans to replace a 150-home subdivision with an industrial park.","42 years on Bryn Mawr Ave Chicago, IL","W Bryn Mawr Ave, Chicago, IL, USA","(41.9829975, -87.7496357, 0.0)",41.9829975,-87.7496357,0.0,2022

That values it at more than $1 billion.It was among the largest transactions for an office building in Chicago, with Willis Tower as the only Chicago skyscraper with a higher valuation, at $1.3 billion when it was sold to Blackstone in 2015.Before the sale, which closed in March, the tower was a $1.6 million loss for Howard Hughes in 2021, according to its first-quarter earnings call.Howard Hughes CEO David O’Reilly said in a release that the tower was one of the last non-core assets the company had in its portfolio. The sale brought in $169 million — the company’s initial investment in the property was $13 million, according to Bisnow.The 1.5 million-square-foot tower opened in 2020. It’s more than 82 percent leased to long-term tenants, according to Crain’s. Its anchor tenant is Bank of America, which leases more than 500,000 square feet and it has a 45-foot lobby, dining options and a secondary air-filtration system that was added after the pandemic. CBRE will oversee leasing and management of the property.The sale comes at a precarious time for Chicago’s office market, a sector still slow to recover from the pandemic and a shift to remote work. It underscores demand for office properties with views and amenities, even as the pandemic turns longtime work practices topsy-turvy. Chicago office buildings that have updated amenities in popular locations like Fulton Market are finding new tenants relatively quickly, while older buildings are struggling.[Bisnow] — Miranda DavisAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",110 N Wacker Drive,"Howard Hughes Corp.,"," had a profitable first quarter, thanks to the sale of its stake in Chicago’s 110 N Wacker Dr., the second-most-valuable skyscraper in the city.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/05/12/howard-hughes-corp-has-strong-first-quarter-after-dumping-chicago-tower/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Howard Hughes Corp.,</a> had a profitable first quarter, thanks to the sale of its stake in Chicago’s 110 N Wacker Dr., the second-most-valuable skyscraper in the city.","110 N Wacker Drive Chicago, IL","110 N Upper Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL 60606, USA","(41.8834084, -87.637378, 0.0)",41.8834084,-87.637378,0.0,2022

Patton’s 548 Capital won city Plan Commission approval to move forward on the $22 million project. The firm will redevelop a printing press that was used for the first nationally syndicated African American-owned newspaper founded by Malcolm X.Perhaps more unique is how the development is being financed: $5 million of the project’s funding comes from a deal tied to Sterling Bay’s tower at 160 North Morgan Street.Commercial real estate development group Alter is acting as project manager.Under changes the city made to its Affordable Requirements Ordinance in April 2021, housing developments in most Chicago neighborhoods must be 20% affordable. Under the ordinance, developers may pay to opt out of the requirements. While that money would usually go toward the city’s housing fund, Sterling Bay, 548 Capital and the city worked out a deal for that money to fund the Solar Lofts project, according to Patton, who said the agreement was among the first of its kind for the city.Patton said the 80,000-square-foot, mid-rise project will “be kind of planting a flag in terms of sustainability and inclusivity particularly in a neighborhood which is seeing a lot of economic pressures.” More than half of the units are affordable housing.Gregory Williams of Gregory Ramon Design Studio, the project’s architect, said the development is “creating housing in an area that definitely needs it” and making use of a building that has long been vacant.Patton has previously led projects city officials have viewed favorably and was picked for a $38 million industrial complex project in North Lawndale that is part of the city’s Invest South/West initiative. He also recently purchased property in the 3800 block of West Chicago Avenue in the West Humboldt Park neighborhood with plans for a $33 million mixed-use project.The project will go before the city’s Zoning Committee on Tuesday.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","548 Capital, Gregory Ramon Design St",A 47-unit mixed-,"income, solar-powered housing complex is coming to the South Loop.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/09/15/a-j-pattons-548-capital-approved-for-south-loop-housing-complex/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A 47-unit mixed-</a>income, solar-powered housing complex is coming to the South Loop.","548 Capital, Gregory Ramon Design St Chicago, IL","540 W 35th St STE 206, Chicago, IL 60616, USA","(41.8310436, -87.6404579, 0.0)",41.8310436,-87.6404579,0.0,2022

It’s scheduled to open in late 2022.“We’re not here to say that we don’t want to have it here,” said Howard Ray Jr., a West Humboldt Park resident who organized the group. “We are here to say we want to be partners, and we want certain benefits. And if you can’t have those benefits, you don’t need it here.”Reaching a deal could be an uphill climb because the Seattle-based company has been reluctant to agree to such terms. It pressured Seattle officials to repeal a head tax on large employers, which would have been used to fund the city’s homeless services, said Ben Bach, legal director at PowerSwitch Action.Amazon opened at least 10 distribution centers in Chicago this year, most recently in suburban Matteson and Markham, and is building warehouses in Gage Park and Huntley. It hired 15,000 employees in Illinois last year and said in September that it will take on 6,000 workers for fulfillment centers in the suburbs south of Chicago as it expands its distribution network in the area.Amazon couldn’t be reached for comment, the Tribune reported.Alderman Emma Mitts of the 37th ward didn’t comment on whether she would support the push for benefits.“We are focused on expanding our major commercial business corridors, as well as building proactive public-private relationships within the 37th Ward,” Mitts said. “Amazon is making a major stake in Chicago, and I believe their entrance into the West Side of Chicago is a good thing.”[Chicago Tribune] — Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1260 North Kostner Avenue,Amazon faces, opposition from residents of Chicago’s West Humboldt Park who worry that a planned distribution center will spark higher property taxes and rents.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/12/08/amazon-faces-local-opposition-to-warehouse-in-chicagos-west-humboldt-park/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Amazon faces</a> opposition from residents of Chicago’s West Humboldt Park who worry that a planned distribution center will spark higher property taxes and rents.","1260 North Kostner Avenue Chicago, IL","1260 N Kostner Ave, Chicago, IL 60651, USA","(41.9040611, -87.736323, 0.0)",41.9040611,-87.736323,0.0,2021

The residential building, rising 370 feet tall, will have 377 units, ground-floor commercial and retail space.Trammell Crow Chicago Development will provide 76 affordable housing units on site, following the city’s affordable requirements ordinance to make 20 percent of the new residential developments affordable.The $550 million project started out as two office towers, but the developer converted the building on 1112 West Carroll Avenue to residential after the Plan Commission revised to allow residential developments north of Lake Street in January this year.Renderings of 400 N. Elizabeth Street (Chicago Plan Commission)The Plan Commission also gave the greenlight for a 16-story life sciences building at 400 North Elizabeth Street in Fulton Market. Mark Goodman & Associates proposed to rezone the site to a business planned development from a commercial and manufacturing district. The $150 million project will include about 492,000 square feet of office space and is expected to create life sciences jobs.Both proposals need the City Council’s final approval before starting construction.Tech companies have been leading office migrations to the area, and a new market of biotechnology is set to emerge. Sterling Bay broke ground for island eight-story building that will house medical research facilities in Lincoln Yards this week. That building, dubbed Ally, is part of Sterling Bay’s plan to create a “scientific innovation” district.Office buildings have been battered by the pandemic as vacancy rates climbed to 17.9 percent in the third quarter, according to JLL. While JLL said the rate is driven by sublease space that’s becoming vacant, Fulton Market is an exception.

The Chicago-based development group paid $21.3 million in 2015 to buy the 4-acre site. It secured an $82.5 million construction loan for the project in 2016, according to Crain’s.The Webster Avenue sale is the second high profile sale for Sterling Bay in recent weeks. The company also has an agreement to sell its Fulton Market office building that houses the McDonald’s headquarters for about $430 million. The buyer is a family office in Pittsburgh.Sterling Bay received approval from the city in March 2019 to build the $6 billion mixed-use Lincoln Yards.

The firm paid $2.55 million.The property’s longtime owner, Charles Scala, was the seller, sources said.The new owners don’t have any immediate plans to redevelop the site. The deal was brokered by Steven Rapaport of Chicago Real Estate Resources Inc.The four-story building is located in the booming West Loop, and is around the corner from some high-profile developments.

His assessment of Aon Center more than doubled to $886 million and jumped 30 percent to $95.4 million for apartments at Aqua Tower.The move is part of Kaegi’s campaign pledge to revamp property tax assessments. Since taking office three years ago, Kaegi made sweeping changes that agitated commercial property owners. This year, he moved to assessing properties in downtown Chicago from the suburbs, infuriating landlords.“It makes no sense,” Farzin Parang, executive director of the Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago, told Crain’s. “It’s very political to us. He’s constantly pitting business versus residents.”Critics say that Kaegi is raising assessments even though the pandemic has prevented people from returning to offices. The business district vacancy rate rose to 17.9 percent in the third quarter from 17.3 percent in the prior three months.Kaegi previously told The Real Deal that “assessments are out of date and there are huge inequities.” He said, “I don’t know the alternative that is being proposed instead of market value.”Kaegi’s office says the focus is on accuracy. His predecessor, Joseph Berrios, is under investigation by a federal grand jury probing property value estimations his office made on a number of central business districts and high-end neighborhoods.“The days of favoritism in the assessor’s office are over,” Scott Smith, a spokesman for the assessor, told Crain’s.While downtown landlords will file appeals, it may be an uphill battle.Willis Tower, for example, was assessed by Berrios at $697 million in 2018, even though Blackstone paid $1.3 billion for it in 2015 and invested an additional $500 million two years later. That suggests Kaegi’s assessment may not be that far off the mark.Ares Management bought the 82-story Aqua Tower for $191 million in 2019, when it was assessed at $254 million, well below its most recent valuation of $95.4 million.Aon Center, however, was valued at $824 million when it was refinanced three years ago by a venture led by 601W, well below Kaegi’s assessment.If landlords aren’t satisfied after filing appeals to the assessor’s office, they can turn to the county Board of Review or the Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board. Kaegi doesn’t have a final say on the value of the properties.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",4 million.Aon Center,Tax hikes are on the, horizon for landlords of some of Chicago’s most prominent downtown buildings after Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi boosted their value.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/10/19/chicagos-trophy-landlords-infuriated-as-kaegi-boosts-property-assessments/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Tax hikes are on the</a> horizon for landlords of some of Chicago’s most prominent downtown buildings after Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi boosted their value.","4 million.Aon Center Chicago, IL","Aon Center, Chicago, IL 60601, USA","(41.8852516, -87.6214919, 0.0)",41.8852516,-87.6214919,0.0,2021

MANICA’s most recent projects include the Las Vegas Raiders’ new $2 billion Allegiant Stadium, as well as the San Francisco Warriors Chase Center. Founder and principal David Manica worked on national and international projects such as the Las Vegas Raiders Headquarters and Training Facility, VTB Arena Park, Cagliari Calcio Stadium, The Inter-Miami MLS Training Facility, The Mercedes-Benz Arena in China, and The Shantou Sport Park.CAA also worked on the Raiders project with MANICA as well as the 1060 project, a multiyear renovation of Wrigley Field.The firms add substance to the Bears’ plans to potentially relocate to Arlington Heights, a move that has been brewing since last September, when the Bears and Arlington Park owner Churchill Downs Inc. disclosed the NFL franchise had inked a $197.2 million agreement for the site, currently a racetrack. The deal isn’t expected to close until the first half of 2023.Ted Phillips, the team’s president and CEO, is leading plans for the relocation. Phillips secured the controversial $690 million renovations deal at Soldier Field two decades ago. Those renovations led to Soldier Field being delisted as a National Historic Landmark.Soldier Field has long been a complicated facility in Chicago.

(Credit: Common by Paras Griffin/Getty Images; McCaffery via McCaffery Interests; aerial by Cushman & Wakefield)There has never been a shortage of development ideas for U.S. Steel Corp.’s massive stretch of vacant land on the South Side, now marketed as 8080 Lakeshore Drive.Two abandoned projects each involved building over 10,000 homes there, with one of the proposals including millions of square feet of commercial space along with a lakefront marina. Last summer, South Side-born rapper Common was also said to be interested, and had partnered with developers on another plan to bring hotels, entertainment venues and a movie studio. The site was also among five locations Chicago was considering for a casino, and the city planning commissioner suggested splitting the land into parcels then selling those off.So with all that interest, why has the 415-acre former South Works steel mill sat empty for nearly 30 years? It’s complicated, and while real estate brokers, developers and local elected officials remain divided on what to build in an area about the size of Downtown Chicago, they agree it’s too important to remain empty.Illinois is now in a near lockdown caused by the deepening coronavirus crisis, but industry pros believe the vast swath of land along Lake Michigan will play a vital role in Chicago’s future, both as a vehicle to attract more residents and as a means to expand its commercial core.Sarah Ware, principal and managing broker at Ware Realty Group, said some of the challenges with developing the enormous site involve bridging the gap between the property and the surrounding community.“So the question is, are you looking to develop U.S. Steel on its own as an island, or on your way to the 79th Street corridor in South Shore?” she said.City Planning Commissioner Maurice Cox said in January that he thought South Works was far too large for one developer, and suggested chopping it up.“When some are pointing out that it’s as big as the downtown, you start to understand the absurdity of turning that over to a single developer,” he said.Big plans\nToday, the empty site — U.S. Steel shut the plant in 1992 and demolished the buildings — still includes a fading sign partially covered by weeds. It shows a rendering of a $4 billion development a dozen years in the planning between U.S. Steel and Chicago-based developer McCaffery Interests. Abandoned in 2016, the project included a master-planned community with 13,000 homes, 17.5 million square feet of commercial space and a 1,500-slip marina. U.S. Steel pulled out when it was not able to finance the project.“The site itself was certainly worth the time and effort to see if we can do something with it,” said Dan McCaffery, CEO of McCaffery Interests in a recent interview with The Real Deal.There wasn’t anything disastrous that led to the split, he said. The steel company is not in the real estate business, McCaffery added. “They just wanted to put it up for sale and not stay in the partnership. But they’re still trying to sell it.” The company could use the cash infusion from a sale, after fallout from the coronavirus crisis prompted it to idle plants, cut its spending for the year and tap an $800 million credit line, the Street reported last week.A few years ago at the South Works site, Emerald Living planned to build a multibillion-dollar project that would include 20,000 homes. A unit of Ireland-based WElink, Emerald Living partnered with Barcelona Housing Systems, a Spanish builder of modular housing. Those plans fizzled in May 2018, when Emerald Living pulled out over contamination at the site, though U.S. Steel said it had been given the all-clear on any environmental problems from the Environmental Protection Agency, according to reports at the time.The $71 million mixed-use development plan from the group led by Common included a 128-acre film production campus with up to 20 sound stages, plus a sports and recreation complex affiliated with golf legend Greg Norman. The development team included Los Angeles-based developer Sam Nazarian, entertainment management company RoadTown Enterprises, New York-based Morris Nasser and Chicago-based DL3 Realty.Little has changed at the site since it was closed, though modest improvements have been made. In 2002, the Chicago Park District acquired 16.5 acres from U.S. Steel, which was eventually transformed into Steelworkers Park with the collaboration of McCaffery Interests.A spokesperson for U.S. Steel declined to comment on the property or any future plans for it.Marketing pitch\nShortly after ending its agreement with McCaffery, U.S. Steel hired Cushman & Wakefield to market the site, which is 10 miles south of Downtown. Cushman billed it as one of the largest contiguous infill- and waterfront-parcels for sale in the United States. Cushman remains the broker, but declined to comment.Anthony Hardy, agent at Marcus & Millichap, said potential environmental remediation concerns remain for any future developer.“Typically, those steel plants put out a lot of waste and pollution, and with one of the largest steel plants in America making steel in that location for over 100 years, it’s going to be a big challenge in terms of the environmental cleanup,” he added. Meanwhile, McCaffery said its sheer size is problematic. “It’s huge. So that alone is a challenge.”Ware also questioned whether splitting up the development into different parcels, and creating different proposals, would work. “I think that would be a challenge. You want something to be in tandem with what the overall vision is,” she said. “It can’t just be a regular developer or master planner. McCaffery to me was their best bet right now, but the hope is somebody can come in of that level to start it.”“Bite-sized pieces”\nOthers, like Hardy, believe separating the parcels is the way to ensure construction commences.“Part of the issue is that they keep trying to have one huge developer as opposed to breaking it into more bite-sized pieces, and get more developers involved,” he said.Hardy said he was excited about the prospects of the development. His family even toured the site and had planned to buy a home in the future development. “I really like the location,” he said. “I think it has a lot of potential.” He would also like to see some type of housing assistance to help make the homes affordable for more people in the community.McCaffery, who called South Works a “magnificent property,” likened it to a certain popular destination spot in Florida. “Orlando was a swamp until Disney developed it,” he noted. But he acknowledged with South Works, “despite the best of intentions by the best of people, there really hasn’t been an overall political push.” If ground is going to ever be broken on a massive project at the property, he added, “it’s going to have to have a huge public effort.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",8080 Lakeshore Drive,There has never been," a shortage of development ideas for U.S. Steel Corp.’s massive stretch of vacant land on the South Side, now marketed as 8080 Lakeshore Drive.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2020/04/01/south-works-the-415-acre-magnificent-property-is-chicagos-biggest-development-opportunity/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">There has never been</a> a shortage of development ideas for U.S. Steel Corp.’s massive stretch of vacant land on the South Side, now marketed as 8080 Lakeshore Drive.","8080 Lakeshore Drive Chicago, IL","8080 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60617, USA","(41.740766, -87.54048829999999, 0.0)",41.740766,-87.54048829999999,0.0,2020

The Shoreline Sightseeing tour boat company has a launch at the site.Zeller Realty Group owned the office tower, retail space and adjacent Apple Store until October 2017, when Chicago-based Walton Street bought all three properties in a $360 million deal just before the store was scheduled to open. Then, in January, Walton Street turned around and sold the laptop-shaped Apple hub to Invesco in a $79 million deal.Apple pays about $125 per square foot in rent, roughly matching other landmark storefronts on the city’s most prominent retail strip, according to a marketing document cited in Crain’s earlier this year. But just one block down the river, at Trump International Hotel & Tower, tax documents show that brokers failed last year to sign tenants at rents below $30 per square foot.The sale is the latest in a year-long selling spree for Walton Street Capital, which was founded in 1994 by JMB Realty Principal Neil Bluhm.

While the development is projected to be a property tax bonus for the city, it could take as long as 20 years to see the pay-off after the suburban government granted Martell a tax increment financing (TIF) deal.In February, Oak Forest established the city’s eighth TIF district including the project site. It will last for the next 23 years unless ended earlier, and allows for reimbursement to the developer by locking in property value baselines for all properties within the district, and taxing only at those levels even as construction projects raise values within the area.Any taxing bodies, such as the city and school districts, will continue to collect taxes tied to that baseline amount and won’t be able to tax new value until the district expires. The developer could be reimbursed for up to $15.6 million in TIF funds for the project. Once the end of the city’s agreement with Martell’s company is reached, the taxing bodies will charge the property owners within the district at full values, including the increases driven by Martell’s development.Logistics Property’s redevelopment agreement with the city states that the developer would be “unable and unwilling” to take on the project without those incentives.Oak Forest officials said the project site is currently worth just over $1 million, and with a completed warehouse its value could rise as high as $35 million, marking a potentially big payoff for the city once it can tax the Logistics Property warehouse at its full value, once completed.The proposed development site is bound by 167th Street to the north, I-57 to the east and south and Cicero Avenue to the west. It’s located across the highway from the developer’s LogiPark 57-80 in Country Club Hills, a development of 1.4 million square feet of warehouses that rose on a site where plans for an outlet mall stalled out after years of dormancy.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","57 and Highway 50, south of 167th Street",James Martell’s, Logistics Property Co. won a tax break from a Chicago suburb after saying it would ditch plans for a $76 million project without incentives from the local government.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/09/29/martell-wins-tax-break-for-76m-oak-forest-warehouse/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">James Martell’s</a> Logistics Property Co. won a tax break from a Chicago suburb after saying it would ditch plans for a $76 million project without incentives from the local government.","57 and Highway 50, south of 167th Street Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2022

The center – a museum, library and community center – was long billed as a transformational project for the South Side in general and the area around Jackson Park in particular. Yet out of town developers haven’t maintained buildings, locals struggle for housing loans and few people trust what the future will bring.In some buildings, trash is accumulating and requests for repairs are ignored, Tonya Trice, executive director of the South Shore Chamber of Commerce, told Crain’s.“Outside investors aren’t maintaining the properties the way they should,” she said. “There are growing concerns around management, upkeep of the buildings and the eviction rate of South Shore residents.”Construction of the center, announced in 2016 and approved by the city in 2018, began last September and is set to be finished in 2025.Pangea Properties, one of the largest landlords in South Shore and Chatham, is among local investors that have also drawn criticism. Pangea CEO Peter Martay told Crain’s the REIT has invested $400 million in the past 13 years on properties in underserved neighborhoods.It’s not just a residential issue. Many stores on 71st Street are empty while landlords collect a state tax break and await higher rents.Some residents are finding ways to redevelop housing stock and maintain affordable rents. Over the past two years Leon Stenneth, a South Side entrepreneur, bought two buildings in Chatham that were previously owned by out-of-town investors and needed repairs. Stenneth, who works as an tech engineer, made the repairs and was still able to make a profit while charging affordable rents.One way to improve the housing stock is to provide access to credit for residents and landlords who need to buy or renovate buildings, Crain’s reported. Money from the American Rescue Plan Act can be allocated to smaller landlords, for example.“We used to build housing for working people, and we don’t do that anymore,” Nick Brunick, an attorney at Applegate & Thorne-Thomsen who specializes in affordable housing, told Crain’s.Housing advocates also recommend shared ownership, in which residents pool their money to buy property, and citywide gentrification protection like those the City Council established in Woodlawn to include affordability requirements for developments built on city-owned land.The South Shore still has plenty of abandoned buildings.\n“Some of the buildings are encumbered with debt,” Chicago Housing Commissioner Marisa Novara said. “It’s not our goal for out-of-town investors to maximize profits on these buildings.”[Crain’s] — Miranda DavisContact Miranda Davis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n Tenant advocates call for rent protections near Obama Center \n Interra realty brokers pair of multifamily deals on Chicago’s south side \n As South Shore booms, local investor seeks a big payout on 4-building portfolioAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",830 million Obama Presidential Center,Speculators who," snapped up real estate in Chicago’s South Side, betting on a rapid increase in property values after completion of the $830 million Obama Presidential Center is complete, are in for a shock: Rents aren’t covering their mortgages.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/04/08/residents-face-challenges-in-rehabbing-the-south-shores-housing-retail-stock/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Speculators who</a> snapped up real estate in Chicago’s South Side, betting on a rapid increase in property values after completion of the $830 million Obama Presidential Center is complete, are in for a shock: Rents aren’t covering their mortgages.","830 million Obama Presidential Center Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2022

The project still needs re-zoning approval and final approval from the City Council.Retail space in the tower will be about one-third cheaper than nearby space, Goodman said, in response to aldermanic concerns that development in the West Loop is pushing out smaller, “mom and pop” businesses.Some 6.6 million square feet of office space is in the works in Fulton Market, including 1.7 million square feet on one block alone from Sterling Bay.Prolific Fulton Market developer Shapack Partners is building a seven-story, 70,000-square-foot office project at 811 West Fulton Street and another office project at 215 North Peoria Street.And Shapack and Focus Development are planning a massive mixed-use project that would span the area between Halsted and Green streets.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",999 W Wayman Street,Mark Goodman &," Associates secured key city approval for its planned 12-story office tower in Fulton Market, one of slew of office projects in the works for the booming neighborhood.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/07/19/mark-goodmans-12-story-office-tower-in-fulton-market-gets-key-city-ok/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Mark Goodman &</a> Associates secured key city approval for its planned 12-story office tower in Fulton Market, one of slew of office projects in the works for the booming neighborhood.","999 W Wayman Street Chicago, IL","999 W Wayman St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8873511, -87.65103460000002, 0.0)",41.8873511,-87.65103460000002,0.0,2018

Lunt Avenue, according to Block Club Chicago. The building is a 100-year-old, historically protected building that was most recently a sober group living home.It’s again being vehemently opposed by the next-door congregation of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness Chicago, which has been based at 1716 W. Lunt Ave. since 1979.“When people get really annoyed or mad, sometimes they make not good decisions and they are actually threatening,” Sapna Patel, a member of the congregation, told Block Club. “We see again and again, people do take the wrong decision and do harm to a community. It would be scary for me and my kids.”The Krishnas are worried their chanting and singing, which starts as early as 4:30 a.m., could cause tension with their neighbors. Their festivals can also last past midnight, Block Club reported.The Krishnas are also concerned their neighbors might have parties or grill meat, which could disturb the vegetarian congregation.“I’m really concerned about this massive increase in density affecting our ability to practice our religious worship,” said Edward Suda, according to Block Club.\nGassman said at a community meeting last week that he is asking for Alderman Maria Hadden’s support on rezoning. Hadden’s office is seeking feedback on the proposal.\nGassman first proposed adding onto the Lunt property in 2017, a year after he bought it from Lutheran Social Services, which ran the sober home.

Sitt and 942-944 W Fulton Market in Chicago (Loopnet, Thor Equities, Getty)Thor Equities’ hammer can’t be swung as hard as the landlord thought against a Chicago marijuana tenant in federal court.A cannabis business, MedMen, is trying to keep Thor’s lawsuit over alleged unpaid rent at a Fulton Market space from moving into a state court, arguing that marijuana’s federally illegal status prevents its landlord from being able to enforce a lease.Thor this week voluntarily dismissed its suit against the tenant in New York federal court after MedMen raised that defense. The landlord stated it planned to refile its case in a state court within a jurisdiction that the weed business is legal and regulated.MedMen is trying to make sure that can’t happen. The tenant filed a new lawsuit against Thor Wednesday in the federal Southern District of New York to prevent the private equity firm from seeking a new venue.The latest lawsuit by MedMen demonstrates the lengths some tenants will go to fight their landlords as the cannabis sector gains greater recognition as an industry while still operating within a patchwork of varying state and federal regulations.In the suit, as in its motion to dismiss the earlier federal case Thor had filed, attorneys for MedMen argue its lease is illegal and thus unenforceable under federal law, as marijuana remains a Schedule I narcotic. The tenant goes on to demand a judgment declaring the lease void.The filing doesn’t dispute that the tenant hasn’t paid rent since before August 2021 and surrendered the premises at 942-944 West Fulton Street to Thor Equities in February. Attorneys representing MedMen and Thor didn’t return requests for comment.Thor sued MedMen earlier this year for almost $1 million in unpaid rent at the property. The cannabis company had leased the space for more than two years. MedMen owed more than $950,000 for failing to pay the base rent of $70,727, operating costs of $2,667 and insurance costs of $556 for 11 months, according to Thor’s initial complaint.The dispensary inked a 15-year lease for the 23,000-square-foot warehouse-style space in August 2019, months before Illinois legalized marijuana on Jan. 1, 2020. The lease provided for an annual rent of $800,000 that will increase each year to $1.2 million in the fifteenth year.This isn’t the first time Thor has sued a cannabis company over unpaid rent. The High Times dispensary had to pay Thor $4.9 million as a result of a lawsuit, though the company never opened in San Francisco.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",944 West Fulton Street,Thor Equities’, hammer can’t be swung as hard as the landlord thought against a Chicago marijuana tenant in federal court.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/10/20/thor-shops-venues-in-lawsuit-as-weed-firm-tries-escaping-unpaid-rent/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Thor Equities’</a> hammer can’t be swung as hard as the landlord thought against a Chicago marijuana tenant in federal court.","944 West Fulton Street Chicago, IL","944 W Fulton St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8869499, -87.6516556, 0.0)",41.8869499,-87.6516556,0.0,2022

Even though the stop-work order is still in place, 45th Ward Ald. Jim Gardiner recently said the order had been lifted.Erroneously ignoring the work stoppage, at a recent meeting with Old Irving Park community members Gardiner said the council was “very excited about the roughly $100 million project and we think it will be a new shot in the arm for the Six Corners community.”The record was set straight when Department of Buildings spokesperson Michael Puccinelli told the outlet that the order “remains in full effect for any renovation and new construction as no building permits for that work have been issued.”The city is also still in the process of reviewing the illegal work that was done this summer to see if it was up to code, Puccinelli said. The work done includes the construction of an additional story as well as steel columns and exterior concrete. The only permits that were issued for the project were for interior demolition.Puccinelli said Novak has been cooperating with the city and is working to secure the necessary permits.The $90 million project will yield 206 apartments ranging in size from studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms.

The property used to bear the name of CNA Financial.DMK is behind restaurants including Ada Street, DMK Burger Bar, Fish Bar, Fort Willow and Marshall’s Landing in the Merchandise Mart. Hayden Hall will be among the largest Chicago food halls. It will feature food stations around a communal seating area, and will also feature pickup, delivery and full-service-dining options, according to the Tribune.CNA left the building last year for John Buck’s new 35-story tower at 151 North Franklin Street, bringing the CNA Center name with it. Facebook last year signed a 263,000-square-foot lease in the 807,000-square-foot building, which also includes law firm Hinshaw & Culbertson as a tenant.To replace CNA at 333 South Wabash, John Buck signed Northern Trust Corporation to a 462,000-square-foot lease that also gives it naming rights to the building sometimes known as “Big Red,” according to the Tribune. Northern Trust is set to move in next year.Hayden Hall joins a growing number of food halls cropping up Downtown. Those include a 13,000-square-foot location from Galley Group owned by McCaffery Interests in Fulton Market and Urbanspace’s location in Blackstone Group’s new addition at the base of the Willis Tower.

A year ago, the firm projected\xa0about 3,000 units would come online in 2019.The expanding job market is driving the demand for housing, and many people are choosing to rent instead of own, Crain’s reported. Plus, young professionals who work in the suburbs can get more for their money in towns like Evanston and Oak Park than they could in Chicago.Additionally, the suburban market is increasingly catering to move-down renters, with developers building lavish, condo-style projects targeted toward empty nesters who sell their single-family homes after their children move out.Suburbs with big downtowns give renters easy access to restaurants and shops, and projects near train stations have been top of mind for developers.Since 2015, the most active suburbs for apartment development have been Evanston, where 1,079 units have been completed, follow up Oak Park with 1,056 units, according to Integra.Though the suburban apartment market has seen a lot of growth in recent years, it’s been fairly slow and steady, especially compared to the Downtown development frenzy. The average rent for a typical 900-square-foot apartment in the suburbs is $1,332 per month, up from $963 at the beginning of 2010.Overbuilding and oversaturation shouldn’t be an issue in suburban Chicago despite the activity given its vastness and adequate spacing between new supply, Crain’s reported.More than 13,000 additional units are in the works in the suburbs, but DeVries expects completions to fall to about 2,500 apartments next year due to rising construction costs, uncertainty surrounding property taxes and Illinois’ precarious fiscal condition, all of which could further curb development.

Plans for a substantially larger building would likely require rezoning approval from the city. The reason for prohibiting another rink seems clear. Moro owns another Johnny’s IceHouse at 2550 West Madison Street.Meanwhile, nearby Fulton Market remains one of the hottest neighborhoods in the city, and in the fall a new 45,000-square-foot building at 1100 West Fulton Market was on track to break a price-per-square-foot record, if it sells for its full asking price. Developed by Fulton St Companies, the property entered the market in October for more than $40 million. That breaks down to about $881 per square foot, which would break the neighborhood’s all-time record.Most of Chicago’s real estate market, however, has been battered by Covid-19. The industrial market was one of the few sectors left relatively unscathed, and residential sales have continued to climb in the past few months, signaling a potential comeback.

J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order, which now runs through April. The governor has said he expects construction to continue, though some companies may choose to halt work.Uber signed a 10-year, 463,000-square-foot lease\xa0 in the massive Old Post Office at 433 West Van Buren Street in August. The company said the new space would enable it to hire more than 2,000 people over the next three years.Uber currently leases about 185,000 square feet between two office buildings at 225 West Randolph Street and 111 North Canal Street.In 2016, New York-based 601W Companies paid $130 million for the long-vacant, 2.5-million-square-foot post office complex.

Should its answer be yes, it will mean even newer properties that fetched premium sales prices a few years ago aren’t enough to compete with the latest development wave without substantial upgrades.“A building like this staring down the barrel of a gigantic vacancy that is effectively a new building, if anything, they will spend some money on even more lavish amenities,” said tenant representative Michael Pink, who leads MAP Real Estate.Irvine didn’t respond to requests for comment.Buildings like 300 North LaSalle still have an edge even without renovations over many other Chicago offices. Moves like Kirkland’s and Boston’s from young properties to the latest development sites will give other tenants a chance to upgrade into something built this century on LaSalle, perhaps spelling trouble for older Loop properties just across the Chicago River.“It’s a chance for [Irvine] to reassess its value proposition and improve the asset to cater to today’s tenant needs,” Cleveland said. “I am very optimistic that building will re-lease after that reassessment. It’s as much of an opportunity from a tenant standpoint as it is a detriment to the market.”He pointed to the turnaround that nearby River North office highrise 321 North Clark underwent in the early 2000s, when it was the same age as the LaSalle building as it lost anchor tenant Quaker Oats and a series of others, and its occupancy dropped to just eight percent from full.Hines and a partner bought it for $147 a square foot in 2001, invested in adding amenities and floor space, and sold it in 2006 for double its purchase price, the developer said. It was 80 percent leased last year when it landed a $296 million loan.After the LaSalle building was completed in 2009, it was bought in 2014 for a then-record price of $850 million by Irvine, and value looks to have been left intact so far, showing how much timing matters.Tenant departures have the potential to impact that, though. It’s still 96 percent occupied with the big tenants in place. Boston’s lease ends in 2024 and Kirkland’s in 2029 with an option to terminate in 2025, and DBRS Morningstar last reported Irvine’s $475 million loan set to mature in 2024 on the LaSalle property remains investment-grade.“There’s no reason the borrower has to worry about defaulting yet, but it’s one everyone has their eye on,” Manus Clancy of Trepp said. “This new partly remote work week will weigh on office values for older stuff and it doesn’t have to be that old. Delinquencies will tick up over time slowly. The market will come back but it will take time in New York and Chicago.”All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",300 North LaSalle Street,A modern Chicago," tower is about to lose its two largest tenants, testing the value of youth in the city’s office market, where newer buildings have better weathered the pandemic that has driven up vacancy rates.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/03/28/river-north-towers-looming-vacancies-show-that-in-chicago-office-market-youth-is-not-always-enough/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A modern Chicago</a> tower is about to lose its two largest tenants, testing the value of youth in the city’s office market, where newer buildings have better weathered the pandemic that has driven up vacancy rates.","300 North LaSalle Street Chicago, IL","300 N La Salle St, Chicago, IL 60601, USA","(41.888245, -87.6330981, 0.0)",41.888245,-87.6330981,0.0,2022

When the company’s sole tenant moved out late last year, R2 began converting the building into a mixed-use office and retail hub, according to leasing director and principal Matt Duhig.With R2 set to make the formal move next week, Duhig expects the remade space — which is already 80 percent leased — to benefit from a wave of new interest stemming from the City Council’s passage of the sweeping North Branch Framework Plan last year.The 160-acre island, bordered by the river to the west and the North Branch Canal to the east, was traditionally dominated by warehouses and manufacturers before it was rezoned to allow for retail and office space. Residential is still prohibited on most of the island.“There’s been a serious uptick in demand since this framework was passed, because there’s only so much space on the river for these retailers and restaurant operators to go,” Duhig said. “It’s destiny for an area that’s a five- or 10-minute Uber ride from Lincoln Park, Bucktown and the West Loop.”The building’s retail component will include a Hero Coffee shop, set to open in September. Hero already operates cafes in the Loop, West Town and the West Loop.R2 lists 23 Chicago properties in its portfolio, eight of which are on or within sight of Goose Island.Across the canal, R2 is building a 40,00-square-foot REI superstore at 1442 North Kingsbury Street. It joins a crop of new development along the “wild mile,” a stretch of waterfront set to include a boardwalk, fishing stations and “vegetative islands” facing Goose Island. And earlier this week, Structured Development announced it had leased a 40,000-square-foot Planet Granite climbing gym for its Shops at Big Deahl complex being built the area.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1200 North North Branch Street,R2 Companies is," moving its Chicago headquarters from the West Loop to a freshly-renovated 55,000-square-foot building on Goose Island, The Real Deal has learned.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/06/15/r2-companies-moving-hq-to-goose-island-bringing-retail/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">R2 Companies is</a> moving its Chicago headquarters from the West Loop to a freshly-renovated 55,000-square-foot building on Goose Island, The Real Deal has learned.","1200 North North Branch Street Chicago, IL","1200 N North Branch St, Chicago, IL 60642, USA","(41.9040302, -87.65641769999999, 0.0)",41.9040302,-87.65641769999999,0.0,2018

Pritzker and Mike Reschke with 115 South LaSalle Street (Getty Images, Matt Haas, LoopNet)Debt against the Loop towers that were a key to paving the way for Google to expand in Chicago sold for a discount of just more than a third from the original loan.Mike Reschke’s Prime Group bought Union Bank’s loan of $191 million on the 1.2-million-square-foot, two-building complex at 115 South LaSalle and 111 West Monroe streets. He paid $120 million, or around $100 per square foot, marking a loss of about $71 million for the lender, according to a person familiar with the deal.Reschke came out on top of competitive bidding for the debt.Union Bank hired JLL to market the debt for sale after the property’s previous owner––a venture of South Korea’s Samsung Life Insurance––lost its two largest tenants, BMO Harris Bank and law firm Chapman & Cutler. Their moves into the newly built BMO Tower at 320 South Canal Street left the LaSalle and Monroe offices almost entirely vacant and prompted Union Bank to swallow the loss on its loan.Union Bank declined to comment.Reschke’s subsequent deal to flip one of the buildings he acquired in assuming the debt––the LaSalle tower––to the State of Illinois for $75 million allowed Google to take the entire Thompson Center to the north at LaSalle and Dearborn streets. The state had previously planned to move back into the Thompson Center, where it has kept various offices for decades, based on Reschke’s plan to put as much as $280 million into renovating the building.Reschke set out to revise that plan when Google came knocking for more office space in Chicago, and said it wanted the entire 1.2 million square feet in the Thompson Center.Reschke and the state obliged once the deal for the buildings on LaSalle and Monroe streets fell into place.The developer called it “a miracle” that the former BMO building became available at a discount just as Google was on the hunt. He agreed to overhaul the Thompson Center as part of a new deal that calls for him to buy it from the state for $105 million and prepare it for a 2026 Google move-in. That required the state to agree to buy a 625,000-square-foot portion of the South LaSalle and Monroe complex from Reschke for $120 per square foot, up from the $100 or so per square foot he paid for the entire property.Reschke’s sale to the state also lowered his basis on the Monroe portion of the property to $45 million, or a little less than $80 per square foot. Such discounts on vintage Loop towers from the more than $200 per square foot recently fetched by others with higher occupancy rates will be necessary for developers such as Reschke who plan conversions of office towers to new uses like apartments.Transforming offices into apartments, for instance, is a pricey proposition. Financial barriers are expected by Chicago’s urban planning experts who have pushed for some of the pandemic-battered Central Loop buildings facing high rates of office vacancy to be turned into apartments.Reschke plans to keep the lower 13 floors of the Monroe portion of the former BMO property as offices and turn the upper 10 floors into as many as 300 apartments.Owners of other Chicago buildings facing financial risk as office tenants cut back on real estate amid the pandemic aren’t dealing with as much vacancy as Samsung was on the former BMO property, and other distressed property sales will likely occur closer to between 10 and 20 percent off the cost of their debt, the person said.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",115 South LaSalle Street,Debt against the, Loop towers that were a key to paving the way for Google to expand in Chicago sold for a discount of just more than a third from the original loan.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/05/reschke-got-loop-towers-at-33-discount-to-clear-google-for-landing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Debt against the</a> Loop towers that were a key to paving the way for Google to expand in Chicago sold for a discount of just more than a third from the original loan.","115 South LaSalle Street Chicago, IL","115 S La Salle St, Chicago, IL 60603, USA","(41.8803896, -87.63194229999999, 0.0)",41.8803896,-87.63194229999999,0.0,2022

The publicly-traded REIT owns 150 hotels around the country, including 10 in the Chicago area.RLJ will use the proceeds of the five-year, floating-rate loan to pay back two other loans, saving it about $2 million in interest payments, according to a press release. The loan was secured by seven hotels.RLJ bought the 306-key Courtyard by Marriott in 2006, part of a 100-hotel portfolio it acquired from Indiana-based White Lodging in a $1.7 billion deal. The firm in 2017 launched a renovation of the building at 165 East Ontario Street, including interior work on 15 floors and a complete re-roofing.The mortgage comes on the heels of a bumpy year for hospitality REITS, whose stock prices flagged then recovered last year only to fall again during December’s stock market sell-off. At $17.89 per share, RLJ is up 9% from its January low point but well below its 2015 peak of $35.62 per share.The Magnificent Mile saw some of the city’s priciest hotel transactions last year, including Denihan Hospitality’s $83 million sale of the 297-key James Chicago Hotel. Marriott also sold the nearby Tremont Chicago Hotel at 100 East Chestnut Street in a $26 million deal.Downtown hotel operators saw huge spikes in revenue and occupancy last year, backed up by the city’s record levels of tourism and its enduring reputation as a convention destination. But the roughly 2,000 new rooms set to come online in the city this year might pressure property owners to keep their room rates flat or shell out for upgrades.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",165 East Ontario Street,A Maryland-based, hotel REIT took out a $200 million loan on a portfolio of properties including a Courtyard by Marriott in River North.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/04/22/hotel-reit-secures-200m-refinancing-on-river-north-marriott-six-other-properties/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A Maryland-based</a> hotel REIT took out a $200 million loan on a portfolio of properties including a Courtyard by Marriott in River North.","165 East Ontario Street Chicago, IL","165 E Ontario St, Chicago, IL 60611, USA","(41.8931546, -87.6230704, 0.0)",41.8931546,-87.6230704,0.0,2019

The couple purchased the home at 2308 W.

Chicago slapped “Windy City Rehab” with stop-work orders for violations of multiple construction codes. Some of those were eased in recent months. Gramenos also dropped Eckhardt and his development company from the show, and said she would finish the remaining episodes and projects on her own.And to tie up another loose end, she has made her offer to buy the Morrisseys’ home, and is seeking to dismiss their lawsuit.“She is interested in buying the house back and she would be glad to join the neighborhood,” Gramenos’ lawyer, Dan Lynch, told the Sun-Times.

Property taxes are mainly used to help fund the city’s public school system.Jordan’s Park City, Utah, home sold in December, a little over a year after it listed. (Zillow)Jordan, a billionaire and majority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats, first listed the home in 2012 at $29 million. The 6-acre spread with No. 23 emblazoned on the entrance gate has gone through a series of price cuts. But for the past few years, the mansion has been offered at $14.85 million. The home at 2700 Point Lane has also failed to sell at auction, and a few marketing tricks have been unsuccessful. Jordan, who built the home during his first marriage, kept it after his divorce and now lives in Florida with his second wife.Because of its price tag, size, proximity to a railroad track and many custom features, the sprawling estate has been unable to seize on the hot suburban market, both in the Chicago area and around the country.But another Jordan-owned home did sell in recent months, this one in Park City, Utah. The 9,500-square-foot mountain retreat sold for $7.5 million in December, after Jordan listed it in October 2019, according to Redfin. He had paid $7.9 million for the five-bedroom, eight-bathroom home at 7495 Purple Sage.

LaSalle Street, Chicago (Loopnet, iStock, Illustration by Kevin Cifuentes for The Real Deal)The value of Chicago’s Field Building at 135 South LaSalle Street dropped by $200 million since 2015, leaving the property owner just above water.A recent appraisal put the 1.3 million-square-foot building’s value at $130 million, a fraction of the $330 million it was appraised for in 2015, before longtime tenant Bank of America moved out of 830,000 square feet last year for its own namesake, 57-story building at 110 North Wacker Drive, Crain’s reported, citing Bloomberg.The new appraisal puts the building at less than 40 percent of its 2015 value, though it doesn’t put New York-based owner AmTrust Realty underwater on its $100 million mortgage.AmTrust refinanced the property in 2015 with the loan, keeping a smaller amount of debt on the building despite its value soaring from the 2008 purchase price of $188 million, a deal financed by AmTrust taking out a $100 million loan at the time to buy the property from Bank of America in a sale-leaseback, Crain’s reported.While AmTrust decided against taking out an even bigger loan while refinancing in 2015, it turned profits from the building as its owner, with the property’s net cash flow nearly $18 million annually, well over the $3.3 million yearly debt service the company paid, Crain’s reported, citing Bloomberg loan data.\nAt 88 years old, the LaSalle Street building, like others in the Loop, may need extensive renovations to compete again in Chicago’s office market, which has seen vacancy near record highs with the rise of remote work amid the pandemic and a preference for newer Class A buildings in Fulton Market among companies needing space.\xa0AmTrust is planning to put $100 million into renovating its six other Chicago office properties, but not 135 South LaSalle, it announced last fall, according to Crain’s.It is unclear if the company plans to hold onto the Field building or if it will surrender its deed to a lender. A person familiar with the company’s plans told Crain’s that would be considered.An adjacent building also is in potential trouble after losing a major bank tenant. A loan for almost $191 million is for sale on the 115 South LaSalle Street property, which is being vacated by BMO Harris Bank and a law firm that have occupied 900,000 square feet there for years, and are moving to BMO’s new namesake tower next to Union Station. The loan is expected to sell for less than that.Mortgage payments have also been missed at other buildings in the Loop, including at 175 Jackson Boulevard and 181 West Madison Street, The Real Deal reported this month.[Crain’s] – Sam LounsberryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",135 S.

The 200,000 square-foot building is now 85 percent leased and construction should be completed next month.Leasing agents Russ Cora and Austin Lusson represented Sterling Bay. Gabrielle Harvey and Eddie Viliunas of Jones Lang LaSalle represented Wellington.Details of the price per square foot were not disclosed.Wellington’s move is set to happen by Q2 of next year and will quadruple its Chicago office footprint after it leaves the much smaller 6,000 square-foot office at 222 West Adams Street in the Loop.Its new Fulton Market office is on the Morgan Street building’s fourth floor. The office will be designed with an open floor plan to accommodate the company’s growth plans to add up to 100 employees over the next few years, according to Crains.The firm joins a wave of others that have relocated from the Loop to Fulton Market as the former industrial neighborhood has become a hip destination. But Wellington is among only a few Chicago businesses that have looked to expand their office space. Crafty, a company that delivers supplies and stocks office pantries, announced plans to relocate to a 12,000-square-foot space in the heart of the Loop, from its 3,500-square-foot headquarters at 917 West Washington Boulevard.In the wake of more companies shifting to remote and hybrid work, Chicago hit a new record-high vacancy rate of 21.2 percent in the city’s central business district — the second-largest in the nation — at the end of March.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",345 North Morgan Street,Fulton Market has, another new non-tech tenant.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/12/financial-firm-moving-to-sterling-bays-new-fulton-market-development/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Fulton Market has</a> another new non-tech tenant.","345 North Morgan Street Chicago, IL","345 N Morgan St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8882076, -87.6518917, 0.0)",41.8882076,-87.6518917,0.0,2022

Michigan Avenue (JLL, Google Maps)The Neiman Marcus building on Chicago’s Magnificent Mile was sold by UBS Realty Investors for an undisclosed price after six months on the market.The buyer, Silvestri Investments, is betting on the revival of Chicago’s famed shopping district at a moment when it’s struggling with a series of pandemic-related challenges: a dropoff in foot traffic as office workers stay home and tourism declines; rising crime in the area; and vacant storefronts.The 195,500-square-foot building at 737 N. Michigan Ave is the department store’s flagship location in Chicago. The company has leased there since it was built in 1983. The four-story building has the largest continuous storefront on Mag Mile at 200 feet.“Neiman Marcus is one of only eight trades on Michigan Avenue within the last decade and was highly sought after by both domestic and international capital due to the rare flagship offering on one of the world’s most renowned and proven high-street corridors,” JLL broker Amy Sands said in a statement.Both the seller and the buyer were represented by JLL, with Sands, Clinton Mitchell, Alex Sharrin and Michael Nieder representing the seller, while Christopher Knight represented the buyer. The real estate firm also arranged a seven-year acquisition loan for the buyer.When the building was listed in October, the Cook County Assessor’s office valued the property at $46 million.Perhaps the most important factor in the sale is the duration of Neiman Marcus’ lease, which was undisclosed. A longer lease will prove more lucrative, and increase what the property is worth to an investor.It was the chain’s second most-profitable location and is expected to post $123 million in sales last year, according to JLL. Sales were up 5 percent in 2021 compared with the same period in 2019, Crain’s reported.UBS bought the Neiman Marcus store and an attached office space in 1998 for $104 million. It wasn’t until 2020 that UBS split up the retail and office space. The offices weren’t part of the sale.Retail on the Mag Mile has suffered during the pandemic. The vacancy rate climbed to 26 percent in 2021 from 15 percent from 2019, Crain’s reported, citing Cushman & Wakefield. Closures have included Forever 21, Uniqlo, Gap and Macy’s.Shopping malls and hotels in Cook County were hit in 2020 as the pandemic battered the entertainment industry.

It also accounts for more than half the $330 million spent on March’s five biggest multifamily sales.March’s second-biggest multifamily deal involved CA Ventures, which sold its newly delivered South Loop complex to Diamond Realty Investments for $117 million. CA Ventures also recorded the priciest multifamily sale of February, when it offloaded its 227-unit Kenect apartment complex to Newcastle Limited for $85.5 million.The $330 million spent on March’s biggest multifamily sales easily eclipses the $239 million spent on the five biggest sales in February and the $115 million spent in January.All information comes from Cook County property records.1. Aqua Tower | $190.5 millionAres Management bought out JPMorgan Asset Management’s majority steak in the rental portion of Jeanne Gang’s futuristic tower in Lakeshore East for $190.5 million. The 86-story tower at 225 North Columbus Drive contains 474 apartments, 224 condos and a 334-key Radison hotel, with each section owned by separate entities. JPMorgan in 2010 paid $182 million for its majority stake in the apartments, but hired JLL in September to market it. Magellan Development Group, which developed the tower, still holds a partial stake in the rentals.2. 1140 South Wabash Avenue | $117 millionA month after selling off its Kenect complex in River West, CA Ventures also shed its South Loop rental building for $117 million. Buying the recently delivered complex is Diamond Realty Investments, which is the real estate arm of car manufacturer Mitsubishi. The deal is Diamond Realty’s first in Chicago. CA delivered the complex known as Eleven40 in 2018 and had it 90 percent leased after four months.3. 551 West North Avenue | $15.5 millionCalifornia-based affordable housing investors Avanath Capital Management paid $15.5 million for the 59-unit Renaissance North complex in Old Town. Developed and sold by Chicago firm Renaissance Companies, the complex has a contract with the Chicago Housing Authority requiring at least 18 units be set aside for public housing tenants. The deal is part of Avanath’s massive expansion in Chicago. Since buying the Old Town building, the firm paid $28.3 million for a 156-unit affordable complex in Uptown.4. 4625 South Drexel Boulevard | $4.2 millionInvestor Raphael Lowenstein picked up this three-story Washington Heights rental complex for $4.2 million. Built in 1927, the building contains 62 units, with 45 of them studios. Selling the property was Jamie Glascott and Brett Summers, principals at NOVO Properties.5. 4911 North Whipple Street | $3.15 millionInvestors Fred Jung and Edward Stern acquired this three-story complex in Ravenswood for $3.15 million.

Schneider kept some real estate he could use to net a larger profit for his firm JMS Capital Group’s suburban Chicago office play as it made a deal to sell part of a business park.The credit union BCU bought two buildings from JMS in Vernon Hills in the northern Lake County suburbs for $41.5 million, according to public records.A Schneider-owned predecessor company to Pennsylvania-based JMS bought the buildings in 2012 as part of a $37 million purchase of four structures in the Continental Executive Parke, which totals 294,000 square feet across the campus.The sale is the latest instance of multi-building campuses in Chicago’s northern suburbs of Lake County commanding some of this year’s priciest office deals.BCU, whose legal name is Baxter Credit Union, has long been a tenant of the campus occupying the 103,000-square-foot building at 340 North Milwaukee Avenue, and Schneider’s company moved on from the building as well as 300 North Milwaukee, a 78,000-square-foot office structure.In 2020, it struck an 11-year, $44 million lease with BCU to remain at the property after a year of negotiation, a JMS news release said at the time. Now BCU decided to buy instead of lease.While it’s already a gain for JMS over its purchase price, the firm still has a couple assets it picked up as part of its 2012 acquisition in the area it could capitalize. It held onto the 46,000-square-foot office building at 400 Lakeview Parkway as well as the 73,000-square-foot building at 560 East Bunker Court within the Continental park.JMS also put capital into renovating and upgrading both the BCU buildings in 2020, though the cost of those projects is unclear. Representatives for JMS and BCU didn’t respond to requests for comment.The price on the BCU purchase is well below the $190 million New York-based Northeast Capital spent to buy the four-building, 1.1-million-square-foot Kemper Lakes campus in Lake County that’s nearly fully leased. That was the priciest suburban office sale since 2005, before the firm Dermody closed on a $232 million deal to buy the former Allstate campus in Glenview, which is set to be converted into a massive, 10-building logistics center.Yet the BCU purchase valued the property across the two buildings involved at about $229 per square foot, a step up from the measure on the Kemper Lakes deal, which yielded seller Apollo Global Management $172 per square foot. The Continental Parke buildings were built between 1999 and 2002.Only select office buildings are trading hands, as shown by the tenant Baxter wanting to control its real estate. Rising interest rates have in most cases forced investors to wait until a more friendly borrowing environment is in place, once inflation is tamed.Earlier this year, Opal Holdings spent $180 million on the 697,000-square-foot Corporate 500 complex in Deerfield, long home to Caterpillar, which later announced it was moving its headquarters out of Illinois and put its entire 116,000-square-foot offices in the campus on the sublease market.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",300 North Milwaukee Avenue,John M.

All of the others returned to work long ago after concessions were made.Unite Here Local 1 spokesman Elliott Mallen told the Sun-Times that the union, which organized the strike, that he doesn’t know why the Cambria name was removed, but he speculates it’s related to lost business and declining standards as a result of the strike.The union estimated in July, almost a year after the strike began, that the strike had cost the hotel $300,000 in bookings.The main issue fueling the ongoing strike is the hotel’s demand for an increase in housekeepers’ daily quota of room responsibilities from 13 to 15, according to Mallen.The hotel is operated by Fillmore Hospitality and owned by the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System.

The project could help the cities move beyond their manufacturing heydays, though the bond issuances and the bet on real estate could be a gamble.In Fort Wayne, Indiana, city officials are issuing $45 million in bonds to help turn a former GE plant into a 30-acre mixed-use complex featuring apartments, retail and office space. Over 20 years, the $440 million development is expected to bring in more than $100 million to local coffers.The Fort Wayne project and others like it seeks to create the trendy live-work-play developments that have come to bigger cities. The hope is the new development can lure young, educated workers who may be priced out of cities like San Francisco and New York, developers told Bloomberg.The strategy has proved successful in some cases.In Allentown, Pennsylvania, the city used tax-exempt bonds to finance a retail, dining and office complex. After the exodus of Bethlehem Steel and Mack Trucks, the development has helped lure some big employers to the downtown, including Bank of America.The Fort Wayne project has already seen a number of employers, including Indiana University, announce plans to move into the development.

While the asking price wasn’t disclosed, the hotel was appraised at almost $80 million, or about $400,000 per room, when it opened two years ago.Fulton Market, the former meatpacking district, is downtown Chicago’s busiest neighborhood.\nA total of 40 commercial and residential projects have either been proposed, approved, or are in construction in the district, according to SVN Chicago Commercial.The sale is a litmus test for how investors weigh the risk of acquiring a downtown hotel as the pandemic-battered hospitality industry struggles to recover from the pandemic.The city’s hotel revenue from business travelers will probably drop by 86 percent, or about $2.2 billion this year compared with 2019, according to the American Hotel & Lodging Association.The average occupancy rate at Hyatt House Chicago was just 22 percent last year, translating into negative net cash flow of about $563,000. This figure is well below the $2.1 million Sterling Bay owed in debt service for that year, which could make it hard for a buyer to justify paying close to the property’s appraised value.Sterling Bay took a net loss when it sold the Talbott Hotel for $55 million this month. Sterling Bay, Geolo Capital and Wanxiang America Real Estate Group acquired the 178-key hotel for $51 million in 2015 and had invested $67 million in the property.[Crain’s] — Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",105 North May Street,Sterling Bay is," unloading Hyatt House Chicago at Fulton Market, hoping it can cash out as new developments come on line.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/10/19/sterling-bay-is-unloading-fulton-markets-hyatt-house-chicago/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Sterling Bay is</a> unloading Hyatt House Chicago at Fulton Market, hoping it can cash out as new developments come on line.","105 North May Street Chicago, IL","105 N May St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8833099, -87.65526170000001, 0.0)",41.8833099,-87.65526170000001,0.0,2021

The plan also called for a 1,600-square-foot courtyard, a rooftop terrace and 56 outdoor parking spaces.Developer Matt Ferrino and investors from the Chicago-based Mavrek Development are also backing Interra’s half of the development, according to Interra managing principal Jon Morgan.The City Council in June approved the group’s requested zoning change from a manufacturing district to a B3-5 community shopping district, effectively blessing the proposal.The new owners took over the deed from Brown Legacy Group last week under the name Southport Stay LLC, simultaneously securing a $22.6 million mortgage from Midfirst Bank.Morgan and Interra’s David Gross brokered the sale.The new owners are “courting a variety of users” including hospitality, co-working companies and fitness centers for the commercial space, Morgan said Tuesday.Based in Moline, Illinois, the Heart of America Group manages at least 20 hotels and restaurants across the Midwest.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",71 North Southport Avenue,A venture of Interra, Realty and the Heart of America Group paid $14 million for a vacant four-story factory and surrounding property a few hundred feet from the future site of Sterling Bay’s Lincoln Yards development.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/08/07/interra-heart-of-america-buy-north-branch-warehouse-for-14m-take-out-23m-loan/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A venture of Interra</a> Realty and the Heart of America Group paid $14 million for a vacant four-story factory and surrounding property a few hundred feet from the future site of Sterling Bay’s Lincoln Yards development.","71 North Southport Avenue Chicago, IL","N Southport Ave, Chicago, IL, USA","(41.9370425, -87.6637215, 0.0)",41.9370425,-87.6637215,0.0,2018

The site could accommodate as much as 1,000 apartments on 1.5 million square feet.The building on the site was once owned by Chicago Tribune parent Tribune Media. In 2018, Riverside and Tribune Media, which has since been bought by Dallas’ Nexstar, won City Council approval to demolish the vacant 115,00-square-foot building and build a four-tower office and residential complex. The companies gave up on those plans in April of last year after the pandemic crushed demand for office space.Onni’s property is a former Tribune advertising insertion plant that closed in 2012. At one point, Bally’s planned to use the site as a temporary casino while building its permanent one. The group now plans to instead use the Medinah Temple at 600 North Wabash Avenue in River North.Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in May that Bally’s bid had been accepted to build a $1.7 billion casino, which will include an entertainment center and hotel, at the 30-acre site just south of the old Tribune building in River West.Chicago developer Shapack Partners has also purchased property near the new casino site. A venture controlled by the firm bought the Salvation Army’s downtown River West campus for $25 million in May. The developer also plans to build a 1,110-unit apartment building and a hotel near the site.Bally’s also has the option to buy the 30-acre printing plant site from Nexstar for an undisclosed amount.Onni is responsible for the Halstead Point development on Goose Island, a project at the site of a former Greyhound bus maintenance facility at 901 North Halstead St. It will include a 300-room hotel and 1,400 parking spaces as well as Goose Island’s first apartments.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",700 West Chicago Avenue,Onni Group paid $45, million for a site at 700 West Chicago Ave. as it seeks to profit from land near the location of Chicago’s first casino.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/06/27/onni-buys-goose-island-site-near-casino-site-for-45m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Onni Group paid $45</a> million for a site at 700 West Chicago Ave. as it seeks to profit from land near the location of Chicago’s first casino.","700 West Chicago Avenue Chicago, IL","700 W Chicago Ave, Chicago, IL 60654, USA","(41.8970891, -87.6461563, 0.0)",41.8970891,-87.6461563,0.0,2022

Niemann (seller) along with 1134 Taylorsport Lane in Winnetka (Getty Images, Forward Space, Zillow)A series of price cuts preceded a $6.3 million deal for a Winnetka mansion atop a bluff overlooking Lake Michigan, epitomizing the Chicago suburb’s typical luxury marketing routine of late.The 7,400-square-foot home at 1134 Taylorsport Lane was first listed by sellers Jennifer and Craig Niemann for $7.5 million in June 2021, before multiple discounts brought the ask down to $6.75 million earlier this summer.It closed for about $470,000 less than that. The 16 percent drop between the original listing and closing prices aligns with the gaps settled on by other sellers in the affluent North Shore suburb this year.Ann Lyon (@properties)Jennifer Niemann is the CEO of Forward Space, an office furniture dealership based in Chicago. Ann Lyon with @properties represented the Niemanns and did not respond to a request for comment on the pricing strategy. Frank Capitanini with Coldwell Banker Realty represented the buyers.Last month, a century-old lakefront Winnetka mansion sold for $12.75 million, though it was originally listed for 20 percent more at $16 million. At that seven-bedroom property on 645 Sheridan Road, the buyers plan to replace it with a new home. Built around 1902, it needs repairs and renovations, according to the buyer’s agent.Back on Taylorsport Lane, the Niemanns’ former five-bedroom, six-bathroom home was built in 1981 and features 100 feet of beachfront on Lake Michigan. It was expanded and renovated over the last four years, according to the public listing.The Niemanns bought the home in 2016 at an even larger cut from the initial asking price for $3.7 million, down from the $5.75 million that its previous owners Roy and Elizabeth Skillicorn sought at the time.Despite the price cut, it’s one of 10 sales of $5 million or more this year in Winnetka, where demand has doubled for such high-end homes compared to the five sales at or above that mark in all of 2021. The suburb’s luxury market surged even as the rest of the Chicago market cooled due to rising interest rates.Winnetka’s other high-end properties also sold for below their initial listing prices, though not always by as much.In August, the former Winnetka home of Arthur Nielsen, founder of the A.C. Nielsen Company, sold for $6.8 million after four months on the market and down from the $6.9 million listing price. Built in 1937, that 17,000-square-foot Tudor-style estate was designed by architect Benjamin Marshall, who designed other notable buildings in Chicago, including the Drake Hotel.Contact Miranda Davis\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n Winnetka home sells for $4.4M \n TV ratings pioneer Arthur Nielsen’s former estate sells for $6.8M \n Lakefront Winnetka mansion to be demolishedAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1134 Taylorsport Lane,A series of price," cuts preceded a $6.3 million deal for a Winnetka mansion atop a bluff overlooking Lake Michigan, epitomizing the Chicago suburb’s typical luxury marketing routine of late.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/09/16/winnetka-home-sells-for-6-3m-in-another-high-priced-north-shore-deal/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A series of price</a> cuts preceded a $6.3 million deal for a Winnetka mansion atop a bluff overlooking Lake Michigan, epitomizing the Chicago suburb’s typical luxury marketing routine of late.","1134 Taylorsport Lane Chicago, IL","1134 Taylorsport Ln, Winnetka, IL 60093, USA","(42.123214, -87.738658, 0.0)",42.123214,-87.738658,0.0,2022

05:57 PM","Chicago gave the go-ahead to a massive, $3.8 billion redevelopment on the lakefront site of the former Michael Reese Hospital, promising economic revival for the predominantly Black neighborhood.","[""(Bronzeville Lakefront)Chicago gave the go-ahead to a massive, $3.8 billion redevelopment on the lakefront site of the former Michael Reese Hospital, promising economic revival for the predominantly Black neighborhood.The City Council overwhelmingly approved Bronzeville Lakefront, a years-in-the-making 7.8 million-square-foot mixed-use project led by Farpoint Development.The city will sell the 48.6-acre site to the Farpoint team for $96.9 million. Aldermen also approved spending $60 million from Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s capital plan for street repair and construction and a two-acre park; and agreed to rezone the property.Over the next two decades, GRIT plans to transform the site, building 4,800 residential units and 15 million square feet of office and retail space. The team includes Draper & Kramer, McLaurin Development Partners, Loop Capital, Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives and the Bronzeville Community Development Partnership.The $600 million first phase will develop the site as a life sciences campus focused on health and biomedical technology. The plan includes a 500,000-square-foot laboratory and office facility housing the first U.S. arm of the Israel-based Sheba Medical Center, often referred to as the Mayo Clinic of the Mideast.Sheba said it will occupy 25 percent of the ARC Innovation Center – for Accelerate, Redesign and Collaboration – that will be managed by Chicago-based Kaleidoscope Health Ventures as a home for innovative researchers and startups. The city has targeted life sciences as an economic engine for future growth.Infrastructure construction is expected to begin this fall on the first phase, which also will include senior housing and the Bronzeville Community Center. It could be completed by 2023.The development is one of three multibillion-dollar projects approved since 2019 but is the only one in a minority community. Supporters of the project say it will create jobs and provide housing for low-income residents in neighborhoods including Englewood, Auburn-Gresham and Chatham that have been marred by unprecedented gun violence in recent years.“As the only multibillion-dollar development being planned for a community of color in Chicago, Bronzeville Lakefront will provide a strategic link between the growing central area and the systemically underinvested neighborhoods to its south,” said Maurice Cox, the city’s planning and development commissioner.The sale also unshackles the city from a money-losing proposition that began when former Mayor Richard M. Daley talked aldermen into purchasing the vacated hospital site in 2009.Convinced that Chicago was going to win its bid for the 2016 Olympics, Daley persuaded the council to take on an $85 million loan to build the Olympic Village. But Chicago failed to win the bid – Rio de Janeiro got it — and the property has sat vacant since, racking up interest payments that taxpayers have been paying.The project’s $3 billion second phase is expected to include more medical research facilities, office, retail and residential units. GRIT has agreed to set aside 20 percent, or roughly 1,000 residential units, at reduced rates for low-income tenants.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",25 percent of the ARC Innovation Center,Chicago gave the go-,"ahead to a massive, $3.8 billion redevelopment on the lakefront site of the former Michael Reese Hospital, promising economic revival for the predominantly Black neighborhood.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/07/21/chicago-approves-4-billion-bronzeville-lakefront-redevelopment/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Chicago gave the go-</a>ahead to a massive, $3.8 billion redevelopment on the lakefront site of the former Michael Reese Hospital, promising economic revival for the predominantly Black neighborhood.","25 percent of the ARC Innovation Center Chicago, IL","16 N May St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.882336, -87.655813, 0.0)",41.882336,-87.655813,0.0,2021

Raisides in front of the Centerpoint Northbrook Business Campus at 4000 Commercial Avenue (LoopNet, TA Realty, Junior Achievement of Georgia, iStock)Boston’s TA Realty picked up a decades-old suburban Chicago office building from Walgreens Boots Alliance for $21 million as the pharmacy company eyes an expansion of its nearby headquarters.The 284,000-square-foot office campus with three buildings on 26 acres at 4000 Commercial Avenue in Northbrook had been known as the Walgreens Innovation Center, a research facility near the company’s Deerfield headquarters. Walgreens is planning a 14,240-square-foot addition to its Deerfield campus to replace the Northbrook property.Built in the 1970s, another company called Panattoni, based in Irvine, California, had proposed demolishing the mostly vacant Northbrook building and redeveloping it as a 400,000-square-foot industrial building. It’s unclear whether TA’s purchase of the building was made in tandem with Panattoni as a partner or if the Boston firm has separate plans for the property. Neither company responded to requests for comment.The site’s possible end as a traditional office building and its potential for redevelopment reflects the suburban Chicago market, which features record-high vacancies of 27.1 percent, according to JLL. Brokers have said the rate is driven upward by offices that are outdated and aren’t in prime locations, and have embraced shifts of some buildings away from office uses.Meanwhile, the industrial real estate market is booming amid the pandemic as vacancies in buildings of 200,000 square feet or more dropped to a record low of 2.6 percent in the Chicago area in the first quarter, and developers race to meet the demand. They put a record high amount of product in the pipeline in the first quarter, with 44 buildings totaling 23.7 million square feet underway, Colliers found.The Northbrook property is easy to access along Interstate 294 and was billed as a “great potential for redevelopment, additional development on the excess land on the site, or continued use as a flexible office or mixed-use building,” in a Cushman & Wakefield listing. About 50,000 square feet of the building is used as a merchandising and warehouse space with tall ceilings and dock doors, while the remaining 235,000 square feet is standard office space.TA Realty has made several other transactions in the suburbs of major U.S. cities lately, including this month’s $58 million purchase of a Whole Foods-anchored shopping center in Connecticut, the March sale of a suburban Miami office building for $25 million and a November purchase of a Safeway store and three other retail buildings for $77 million in Mountain View, California.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",4000 Commercial Avenue,Boston’s TA Realty, picked up a decades-old suburban Chicago office building from Walgreens Boots Alliance for $21 million as the pharmacy company eyes an expansion of its nearby headquarters.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/05/26/ta-realty-buys-suburban-chicago-office-from-walgreens-for-21m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Boston’s TA Realty</a> picked up a decades-old suburban Chicago office building from Walgreens Boots Alliance for $21 million as the pharmacy company eyes an expansion of its nearby headquarters.","4000 Commercial Avenue Chicago, IL","4000 S Commercial Ave, Chicago, IL 60617, USA","(41.7519419, -87.5516286, 0.0)",41.7519419,-87.5516286,0.0,2022

The acquisitions are often made through land banks at bargain prices because no other investor is willing to take the risk.In Springfield, Ohio, the Clark County land Reutilization Corporation bought up the Upper Valley Mall for $3 million. It is now in talks with investors to redevelop it into a mixed-use site with housing, a soccer field and retail component.Memphis, Tennessee, bought the Raleigh Springs Mall then demolished it last year to make way for a $28 million Raleigh Town Center, the Journal reported. It will have a library, police station, skate park and 11-acre lake.Malls have suffered from declining foot traffic and competition from online retailers. Many anchor tenants have vacated spaces or gone out of business entirely, forcing owners to scramble to fill vacancies.The new owners of the Westside Pavilion mall in Los Angeles, Hudson Pacific Properties and Macerich, are converting 500,000 square feet there into an office park.A JLL study found that 21 percent of retail-based co-working spaces nationwide are in malls, including one in Chicago.But big-box properties are hard to redevelop for other uses because of large floor plates and no windows.Disputes over uses can also hold up a redevelopment, according to the Journal. In some cases, malls comprise numerous parcels owned by different entities, which means a local government has to spend the time to buy them all.

FPA paid $75.3 million for it in 2019 and completed a multimillion dollar renovation that addressed maintenance issues.100 George Street in Bensenville (Google Maps)Suburban Chicago median apartment rents rose 17 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier to a record $1.87 per square foot. Occupancy rates surged to 98 percent, the highest since 2003.The increases are helping propel profits. Renew on York’s net operating income rose 28 percent last year to $4.3 million.DRA changed the name of the Bensenville apartment complex to The Bennington. The four-building complex at 100 George Street was built in 1974 and has rents that range from $706 for a studio to $1,556 for a two-bedroom unit.Instead of getting a new loan to finance the purchase, DRA assumed the property’s $60.9 million mortgage. That will probably save the company money, because the mortgage has a rate of 3.58 percent, lower than it would cost to borrow now.While FPA sold its Bensenville property, it still owns the Lex in the South Loop, McClurg Court in Streeterville and the Wheaton Center apartments in Wheaton.— Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",100 George Street,A San Francisco," investor sold an apartment complex near O’Hare International Airport for $106 million, or $186,000 per unit, reflecting strong demand in the suburban multifamily market.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/09/fpa-sells-bensenville-apartment-complex-for-106m/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A San Francisco</a> investor sold an apartment complex near O’Hare International Airport for $106 million, or $186,000 per unit, reflecting strong demand in the suburban multifamily market.","100 George Street Chicago, IL","W George St, Chicago, IL, USA","(41.9334989, -87.7368505, 0.0)",41.9334989,-87.7368505,0.0,2022

Its portfolio covers more than 6 million square feet, according to its website.The sale of the Arlington Heights property is the latest in a string of industrial properties trading for multiples of their previous sale prices across the Chicago suburbs in recent months. Values of asset classes including warehouses, truck yards, data centers and vacant land have soared, fueled by consumers’ growing reliance on e-commerce and a short supply leading to competition for space among tenants.Massachusetts’ High Street Logistics Properties picked up a 252,000-square-foot warehouse in Itasca for $36 million in August, more than four times the property’s value a decade ago. And in September, Hawaii’s James Campbell Company sold a 215,000-square-foot warehouse in Franklin Park for more than $30.3 million, tripling the property’s value.Meanwhile, Chicago industrial developers have never been busier as they build to fill the demand.

It would include one-, two- and three-bedroom units, a rooftop deck and just 29 parking spaces, owing to the city’s transit-oriented development rules that limits vehicle spaces.The building is one of three rental ventures planned for the 1700 block of Western Avenue, just south of the Western CTA Blue Line station.Across the street, MCZ Development landed permits earlier this year for a 25-unit apartment building at 1741 North Western Avenue. And down the block, LG Development broke ground last month on a 109-unit complex at 1750 North Western Avenue, after buying the site from GW properties.All three sites are inside the city’s Milwaukee affordable housing pilot zone, meaning they must rent at least 15 percent of their units below market rate, with no option to opt out of the requirement by paying a fee. Some developers have blamed the rules for snuffing out construction. But Bernshtam is one of more than a dozen developers who has moved forward with construction under the new rules since they were implemented in late 2017.

It was registered in 1992 as a city landmark.The building is in the heart of the South Shore neighborhood, a black middle-class lakeshore community that was hit hard by the 2008 foreclosure crisis and has lost population ever since.

Shay bought the 14,260-square-foot full-floor penthouse for $17 million in 2014 and listed the unit for $30 million in September.The five-bedroom unit features floor-to-ceiling windows, a private access elevator and comes with four penthouse level parking spaces, according to Redfin’s listing. Amenities of the building include a 14,000-square-foot spa and health club and residence outdoor space on the 16th floor.Interior views of the penthouse (Redfin)Shah said he would finish the raw space by 2018 and move in, but he never did, though he put up walls and ceilings.“I hosted quite a few events there, but I never really moved in,” Shay told Elite Street after the sale. “My daughters are grown now. They’ve moved out,” he added.“To have this much square footage on one floor with 20-foot ceilings is very unusual,” Chezi Rafaeli of Coldwell Banker told The Real Deal. Rafaeli represented both Shah and the buyer, whom he declined to identify. “This is the largest penthouse on a single floor in the Western hemisphere.”The buyer’s purchase price is the second-highest that anyone has paid for a single Chicago-area property. Citadel Chief Executive Officer Ken Griffin bought four condo units for more than $58 million in the building at 9 West Walton Street in Gold Coast in 2017, in four separate transactions. Only one of his transactions was priced for more than $20 million, according to the publication.Chicago’s luxury residential market surged during the pandemic coupled with gains in the stock market and people’s demand for more space and privacy. More than 100 homes sold for more than $4 million last year, double the average of 51.5 over the past six years.Chicago’s luxury residential sales will continue their upward trend this year as people want to get in on the market with inflation creeping up along with a potential interest rate hike, Chezi said.“It’s [Chicago’s luxury residential market] basically reaching a similar level as the rest of the country because the rest of the country is doing really well,” he said. “If people are jumping into purchasing places, they’re making multiple bids.”[Chicago Tribune] – Connie KimAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",401 N Wabash Avenue,An 89th-floor, penthouse at Chicago’s Trump International & Tower sold for $20 million in the city’s second priciest condo deal.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/03/08/trump-tower-penthouse-sells-for-20m-in-chicagos-second-priciest-condo-deal/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">An 89th-floor</a> penthouse at Chicago’s Trump International & Tower sold for $20 million in the city’s second priciest condo deal.","401 N Wabash Avenue Chicago, IL","Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago, 401 N Wabash Ave, Chicago, IL 60611, USA","(41.8888012, -87.6263094, 0.0)",41.8888012,-87.6263094,0.0,2022

The duo’s connection dates all the way back to when Reinsdorf formed Balcor Co. in 1973, which he later sold to American Express in 1987.The property is within two blocks of the Bulls’ and Blackhawks’ home, the United Center. The lot was sold by a group of developers with Irish roots who bought it back in February for $3.5 million. The initial plan was to build a handful of homes that would have been expensive for the neighborhood, but not unreasonable for the Chicagoans who are being priced out of the nearby West Loop, where property values are swelling due to a wave of new apartment developments.The former owners were asking for around $250 per square foot on the half-acre site. It proved to be a tough sell at first with a rate that was much higher than other development properties in the neighborhood, according to 21 Century broker Steven Powers.The Reinsdorf-backed group clearly saw an opportunity and moved on it. It paid just $3 per square foot less than the owner’s initial asking price for the parcel.It borders another half-acre vacant parcel for sale along Madison Street. The price on that listing has not been disclosed. It is being marketed by Oxford Real Estate’s George Manos, who did not return a request for comment.“The sellers found a great development opportunity and were met with a much more intriguing flip opportunity,” Powers said. “It just goes to show the development that’s coming to the Near West Side.”It’s unclear what the buyer plans to do with the property or how much it could spend on an assemblage. Tom Meador, also a longtime Reinsdorf partner who led Michigan Avenue, did not return a request for comment.What is clear to Powers, however, is that whatever is developed on the property will be at a larger scale than the few homes his client intended to build there. That’s the only way the selling price makes economic sense, the broker suggested.Just to the east on the same block, Michigan Avenue developed the 52-unit Warren and Ashland apartments, which was completed in 2015, according to Yardi Matrix. In 2020, it expanded even farther west into Chicago’s bordering suburb of Oak Park. In that village’s downtown at 435 to 451 Madison Street, the firm’s project was scaled back at the request of neighbors and officials before gaining a required zoning variance to build 42 apartments, cut from the 48 it first sought for the site.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",21 Century broker St,A firm backed by, Chicago Bulls and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf is setting its sights on the Near West Side.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/18/jerry-reinsdorf-backed-firm-buys-lot-near-united-center/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A firm backed by</a> Chicago Bulls and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf is setting its sights on the Near West Side.","21 Century broker St Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2022

Brookfield is planning a $250 million overhaul of Northbrook Court.Hi-Five Sports Zone is taking 14,000 square feet at mall at 1515 Lake Cook Road, taking over the former Sports Authority space after the big box store closed in 2016.Hi-Five Sports ZoneA Hi-Five spokesperson said the nearly 30-year-old sports program converted the former retail store into recreational space for basketball, football, baseball, floor hockey and soccer. The venue features a basketball court, turf field, event space and a lounge area for parents.As part of the renovations, Brookfield and developer Ryan Companies want to tear down the Macy’s store and replace it with 300 apartments, a grocery store, a food hall, new retail, a plaza for special events and more.The owner of the north suburban mall has asked the village to provide $21.5 million in tax increment financing for the project, and to rebate $5.5 million in sales taxes, according to the Northbrook Star.Changes at Northbrook Court have been in the works since January 2017, when then-owner GGP talked about renovating the mall to include fewer anchors and more non-traditional uses like the Hi-Five facility. Macy’s sold its space at the mall for $25 million in January 2018 to GGP, which was bought out by Brookfield in July for $15 billion.The Northbrook Court proposal follows a blueprint Brookfield laid out this year to repurpose poorly performing malls by adding housing, office space or hotels.Battered by diminishing revenue and rising vacancies — particularly after the demise of large tenants like Sports Authority, Toys “R” Us, Carson’s and potentially Sears — many mall owners nationwide are transforming their assets, turning the hulking properties into offices, housing, co-working spaces and hotels.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",250 million overhaul of Northbrook Court,A youth recreational," sports facility is leasing space in the Brookfield Property Partners-owned Northbrook Court shopping center, the latest example of a mall owner turning to a non-retail use to fill vacant space.

Its square footage wasn’t publicly listed. The private network deal didn’t have a public listing price. The home was built in 2018 by Dano Luxury and designed by New Space Architects, after the Knudsons paid $1.2 million for the lot in 2017, according to public records.The couple founded a learning software firm, NogginLabs, that was bought by Ernst & Young in 2018, and previously sold a Wilmette home built by Dano Luxury: the spec property at 214 Fifth Street. They bought that home in 2013 for $1.68 million before selling in 2018 for $1.85 million, and had previously bought a Sixth Street property for $849,000 in 2004 and sold it for more than $1.04 million in 2013, records show.Amenities at the Greenwood Road property include three front porches, a butler’s pantry, a 135-bottle wine cooler, and a 2.5-car garage addition that cost $30,000, according to the listing. All bedrooms include in-suite bathrooms, and the home has a balcony facing the backyard, an indoor pool, recreation room, a built-in full bar, home theater and home gym.The one-third-acre property is a few blocks from Lake Michigan.Frank Capitanini and Trish Capitanini with Coldwell Banker Realty represented the sellers, who have been parties in previous deals the agents have brokered. Sara Brahm with @properties Christie’s International Real Estate represented the buyers, who are not yet identified in public records.North Shore homes continue to sell for high prices this year, despite taking price cuts to change hands.The Knudsons sale is one of four in the affluent North Shore suburb to break $4 million this year, according to deals recorded by public listing sites. Another Wilmette home — whose price jumped thanks to a renovation — sold for $5.2 million just five days after hitting the market in August.That property, an 8,400-square-foot home at 1222 Chestnut Avenue in East Wilmette, closed on Aug. 5 for $5.18 million. It was listed for sale on June 6 for $5.5 million, and went under on June 11, public records show. Just two Wilmette homes hit the $4 million mark in 2021, a banner year for residential real estate, and three hit it in 2020.Also in August, a century-old lakefront Winnetka mansion sold for $12.75 million, though it was originally listed for 20 percent more at $16 million. At that seven-bedroom property on 645 Sheridan Road, the buyers plan to replace it with a new home. Built around 1902, it needed repairs and renovations, according to the buyer’s agent.In August, the former Winnetka home of Arthur Nielsen, founder of the A.C. Nielsen Company, sold for $6.8 million after four months on the market and down from the $6.9 million listing price. Built in 1937, that 17,000-square-foot Tudor-style estate was designed by architect Benjamin Marshall, who designed other notable buildings in Chicago, including the Drake Hotel.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",808 Greenwood Avenue,Traci and Brian, Knudson have become reliable Wilmette clients of developer Dano Luxury Homes and broker Frank Capitanini.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/10/04/couple-becomes-repeat-wilmette-customers-in-4m-deal/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Traci and Brian</a> Knudson have become reliable Wilmette clients of developer Dano Luxury Homes and broker Frank Capitanini.","808 Greenwood Avenue Chicago, IL","808 S Greenwood Ave, Park Ridge, IL 60068, USA","(42.0012033, -87.8410657, 0.0)",42.0012033,-87.8410657,0.0,2022

(SVN Chicago Commercial, lgdevelopmentgroup.com)LG Development Group is adding nearly 200 more apartments to its proposed Fulton Market project and eliminating the office portion. The change comes as the pandemic continues to drive up office vacancy rates and follows a long-standing ban on most residential construction in the trendy district that was scrapped.LG now wants to build 665 units across two towers at 1143 and 1150 West Lake streets, according to SVN Chicago Commercial.The developer, which recently closed on the $32.2 million property sale, had planned to construct an 11-story office building and a 20-story tower with 479 apartments.Those initial plans, which included 5,000 square feet of ground-floor retail, was filed in July 2019, when the ban on most residential development in the district was still in force. It was lifted in May 2020, with the consent of Alderman Walter Burnett, who had previously opposed the move. He hoped the decision would spur development amid the city’s pandemic-crippled real estate market, Burnett said at the time.LG had agreed to a deal for the property two years ago at around the same price, contingent on winning city approval for the project.Sausage-maker ATK Foods owned the property, which includes a 52,000-square-foot building and a vacant parcel.

Its founders, Anthony Klok and Gene Kornota, manage the LLC that sold the Dana, property records show.Spanish firm Eurostars Hotel Company will manage the hotel, which is undergoing a branding change to Eurostars Magnificent Mile, according to a press release from the firm. The hotel has a spa, fitness center, and rooftop terrace.Ortega, the Spanish billionaire and founder of fashion retailer Zara, is a major real estate investor in Chicago and elsewhere. In 2015, his firm paid $176 million for the Esquire Theater building in the Gold Coast, and in 2007 Ortega paid $350 million in an all-cash deal for the retail property at 730 North Michigan Avenue, according to Crain’s.Ortega also has invested heavily in Miami and New York real estate. In 2015, he paid $370 million for an entire block of retail buildings in Miami Beach, one of Miami-Dade’s largest real estate deals ever at the time. That same year, he dropped $145 million on a landmark office building in Manhattan, and later bought a Manhattan hotel for $67 million.Ortega is investing in a strong hotel market in Chicago.

Completed in 1927, the hybrid Gothic and art deco building has views of a park and lakefront and houses apartments as well as vacant raw space.“With the prime location in Chicago’s East Loop adjacent to Millennium Park, there are endless possibilities for repositioning the assets assuming a successful zoning change,” CBRE said in an email marketing the property.The building is controlled by Chicago landlord Marc Realty, who owns apartments on the 13th through 21st floors that aren’t part of the sale, and Toronto-based businessman Xiao Hua “Edward” Gong, who owns the rest.Months after Gong purchased his portion for $20.8 million in a 2017 bankruptcy auction, authorities in Canada charged him with criminal securities fraud. Prosecutors froze his assets and obtained a restraining order, halting any redevelopment. The city also filed a lawsuit over the building’s deterioration and installed a receiver to oversee the property, leading to a court battle.Gong’s company ultimately pleaded guilty to operating a pyramid scheme in February 2021, after which Canadian prosecutors allowed him to reassume control of the building. The receiver, Courtney Jones, has filed a foreclosure suit, alleging $5 million in unpaid bills.A plan to develop part of the building into a hotel was scuttled after the City Council approved a zoning change in 2016 that effectively banned hotel uses for the property.[Crain’s] – Rachel HerzogAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",55 East Washington St,A downtown Chicago," landmark, the city’s tallest when it opened almost a century ago, is on the market after a tumultuous history that could complicate the sale.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/06/15/east-loop-landmark-with-troubled-past-hits-market/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A downtown Chicago</a> landmark, the city’s tallest when it opened almost a century ago, is on the market after a tumultuous history that could complicate the sale.","55 East Washington St Chicago, IL","Pittsfield Building, 55 E Washington St, Chicago, IL 60602, USA","(41.88305580000001, -87.62577309999999, 0.0)",41.88305580000001,-87.62577309999999,0.0,2022

Accardo, said to have headed the Chicago Outfit syndicate, lived in the five-bedroom ranch for 15 years, among several homes in the neighborhood that included a 22-room home on Franklin Avenue.The 1963 home features distinctive white Roman brick and crab orchard stone walls. It was burglarized in 1977 while Accardo and his wife were on vacation. Shortly thereafter, five suspects turned up dead. No one was ever charged.The FBI searched the home in November 1978 after a longtime friend and house man for Accardo failed to show up at a federal grand jury session two months earlier. Agents found $250,000 in cash, a police scanner and a glass-enclosed gun case. Accardo sold the home in 1979 before moving to another River Forest home and then ultimately Barrington Hills. He died at 86 in 1992.It went into contract less than two weeks after being listed for $1.5 million in September. The most recent buyers paid $1.2 million in 2001.The 4,400-square-foot home has four full baths, two half baths, fireplaces, terrazzo floors and a decorative stone wall. It also has a finished basement with a 1,300-square-foot ballroom, a banquet kitchen and two-room guest suite.

Buck II in front of a rendering of the planned two-tower office building project at 655 West Madison Street (The John Buck Company, Juan Gabriel Moreno Architects, iStock)John Buck Co., one of Chicago’s top developers, decided that two is better than one when it comes to downtown towers.The plans to build a two-tower office building in the West Loop, rather than a single skyscraper, Crain’s reported. It’s a bet on the value of new office properties in a post-pandemic world where fewer large tenants are available to take up leases.The project, at 655 West Madison Street along the Kennedy Expressway, was originally meant to be a single, 1.5 million-square foot tower. Buck struck a deal with the property’s longtime owner to buy the site if the city approves a plan for redevelopment, and has had its eye on it since 2019, according to Crain’s. The site is one of the few remaining full-block surface parking lots in the West Loop.Buck made its name developing full-block skyscrapers in the city’s central business district and downtown. As companies cut back on workspace to cope with the popularity of remote work, the Buck will split the project in two and build one at a time. Downtown office vacancies are at record highs and many companies are trying to offload space amid rising interest rates that could make it more difficult to get financing for the project.CEO John Buck II estimated that he’ll need to pre-lease between 150,000 and 200,000 square feet to launch the first tower, down from the 500,000 square feet he would normally want to lease.“Our feeling is that the office is here to stay, but it is clear that virtually all users are going to reduce their footprints, and maybe in the neighborhood of 30 percent to 50 percent with remote working becoming en vogue,” Buck told the outlet. “But there will be a flight to quality.”[Crain’s] – Rachel HerzogAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",655 West Madison Street,"John Buck Co., one"," of Chicago’s top developers, decided that two is better than one when it comes to downtown towers.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/06/28/john-buck-shifts-to-two-tower-plan-for-west-loop-project/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">John Buck Co., one</a> of Chicago’s top developers, decided that two is better than one when it comes to downtown towers.","655 West Madison Street Chicago, IL","655 W Madison St, Chicago, IL 60661, USA","(41.881682, -87.644815, 0.0)",41.881682,-87.644815,0.0,2022

The buyers were Chicago aircraft leasing executives Brian Hollnagel and Victoria Ricks Hollnagel, according to Crain’s.Simpson bought the now-132-year-old house in 2011 for $5.3 million, according to Cook County records. Listing agent Mary Bennett of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices KoenigRubloff Realty Group said Simpson then gutted the interior and renovated it.Archived listings online show the house has six bedrooms, five full baths and a four-car garage. Simpson first listed it for sale in May 2015 at $7.98 million, then increased the price to $8.2 million the next year. By mid-2017, the price was back down to $7.9 million.While the sale closed in June, the Hollnagels actually took ownership a year ago under a deal to delay the recording of the transfer of ownership with the county until last month.The Chicago area has seen a surge in pricey home sales this year. A stripped-to-the-wires penthouse at the Ritz-Carlton Residences on Michigan Avenue sold for $8 million in June, the seventh Chicago-area deal this year to reach that number.JDL Development’s 9 West Walton condo building has dominated the list of most expensive home sales recently, led by billionaire Ken Griffin’s record-shattering $59 million purchase of a four-story penthouse atop the building in April.Overall, Chicago lags far behind its big-city counterparts in terms of $1 million-plus home sales, standing 18th nationwide of the top 50 largest cities, according to a recent report.The mansion bought by the Hollnagels was rented by billionaire J.B. Pritzker and his wife, M.K. Pritzker about a decade ago, while they rehabbed their Gold Coast mansion on Astor Street, which they bought in 2007 for $14.5 million.J.B. Pritzker is the Democratic nominee for governor in the November election. He is the cousin of Col. Jennifer Pritzker, an active Chicago real estate investor through her Tawani Enterprises.

Dakoff said in an email on Tuesday that Strategic Properties, whose CEO is Klor, has delayed the closing.“Unfortunately, the buyer has recently informed us that due to economic pressures, a portion of their funding has been impacted,” Dakoff said. “The board is currently working with the buyer to determine how this impacts the sale and negotiating acceptable terms for this delay.”Strategic Properties leadership didn’t return requests for comment.While Dakoff didn’t cite rising borrowing costs, rates were far more favorable last fall, when the critical threshold of condo unit owners cumulatively holding at least 85 percent of the property’s value voted to accept the offer after rejecting previous, less pricey proposals.Given today’s higher rates, “I’d be shocked if they close it at that number,” said Michael Dobrov, a real estate investor who has assembled a portfolio of thousands of apartments in the Chicago area through condo deconversions. He isn’t involved in the Ontario Street proposal.Such deals are sanctioned by a process laid out in state law that lets a buyer transform condo properties in which units are owned by individuals into rentals under one owner, as long as offers garner a supermajority of votes. They are somewhat unique to the Chicago area, due in part to the sluggish recovery of its condo market from the Great Recession and the strong performance of apartments. They are also often controversial, as they have the potential to strip ownership from unwilling sellers who get outvoted.Strategic Properties’ deal has been faced with litigation: a California federal judge has yet to decide on a motion to dismiss a complaint against the condo board brought by unit owners Gerald Glazer and Julius Cherry, who want to keep their condos and stop the deal from moving forward, Dakoff said. Earlier lawsuits they filed in Illinois courts were dismissed and Dakoff has said the California case lacks merit as well. It’s unclear whether the litigation played a role in stretching out the closing into a tighter economic environment for borrowers than when Strategic made its offer a year ago. The condo board had anticipated an early July closing.Cherry and Peter F. Samuel, a California lawyer representing Glazer and Cherry, who is the former fire chief of Sacramento, didn’t return requests for comment.Dakoff said Strategic Properties says it will work through the problem and noted its efficiency in completing condo deconversions in Chicago. The firm set a previous record for the city’s priciest deconversion when it bought 1400 Lake Shore Drive and turned it into apartments in 2019 for $107 million.“SPNA is adamant that that funding issue has nothing to do with the lawsuits and they are very confident this funding issue will be resolved,” Dakoff said. “They have closed on 100 percent of the deconversion deals they have done.”Nonetheless, the uncertainty has irked Ontario Place residents. A new closing date hasn’t been set.“Myself and many owners are frustrated not knowing what’s going on,” said one resident, Bill Martinez. “It’s a hell of a way to live.”Klor’s firm is also in the midst of closing a $96 million condo deconversion for a 310-unit Loop building at 200 North Dearborn Street that was accepted by the 85 percent threshold of unit owner voters this summer.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",10 East Ontario Street,Yitzy Klor’s," Strategic Properties of North America has hit a snag in closing what would be a record $190 million condo deconversion, a complication that arose a week after the Federal Reserve delivered its clearest signal yet that it would keep hiking rates.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/08/31/record-190m-condo-deconversion-on-shaky-ground/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Yitzy Klor’s</a> Strategic Properties of North America has hit a snag in closing what would be a record $190 million condo deconversion, a complication that arose a week after the Federal Reserve delivered its clearest signal yet that it would keep hiking rates.","10 East Ontario Street Chicago, IL","10 E Ontario St, Chicago, IL 60611, USA","(41.8934976, -87.6277186, 0.0)",41.8934976,-87.6277186,0.0,2022

Allstate, which employs about 8,000 people in Illinois, hasn’t provided details about when it will be sold or how many workers will be affected.The news of Allstate’s sale came as PricewaterhouseCoopers said that it will let 40,000 employees permanently work remotely from anywhere in the continental U.S. Employees will be required to come into the office up to three times a month for in-person meetings. The company expects 30 to 35 percent of employees will take up the offer.As of Sept. 22, more than a third of office workers in the top 10 U.S. markets were physically back to work, according to Kastle Systems, which aggregates data from its swipe-card access systems. A report from by Cushman & Wakefield says the return-to-office trend around the globe will start to pick up in the first quarter of 2022.Allstate’s decision comes on the heels of another potential move by a Chicago-area institution after half a century.

Kiersey, Jr. (Dermody Properties, Getty)Glenview’s Allstate corporate campus is on the precipice of a total transformation now that its sale has been finalized.Reno, Nev.-based Dermody Properties completed the $232 million purchase of the 232-acre site at 2775 Sanders Road in the northern Chicago suburb, Crain’s reported. The industrial developer can begin construction on its first phase, which will include five warehouses totaling more than 1.2 million square feet that will open within a year.The first phase of the development also involves demolishing the building that served as the insurance company’s longtime headquarters. The project’s final form will see a 10-building, 3.2 million-square-foot logistics park.“This redevelopment project stands at the intersection of two significant and durable trends—work from home and e-commerce,” Dermody President Doug Kiersey said in a statement. He added that the conversion of the dated campus will be put to better use as an industrial park and create sustainable economic value for the community.After Allstate agreed to sell the property to Dermody about a year ago, the village of Glenview also agreed to an incentive package for the developer as the project stands to generate around $135 million in tax revenue.This project joins a record number of Chicago-area industrial developments currently underway. During the third quarter of 2022 some 37.5 million square feet of warehouse space was under construction in and around the Windy City, beating out the previous record of 30.1 million square feet in the second quarter of 2021, according to a Colliers report.Dermody is building the first pieces of the project on spec, similar to around 80 percent of similar projects currently under construction in the Chicago area, per Colliers. This suggests developers in the area are forecasting ample demand for industrial space, which is counter to other U.S. markets.— Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",2775 Sanders Road,Glenview’s Allstate, corporate campus is on the precipice of a total transformation now that its sale has been finalized.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/10/19/dermody-buys-232m-allstate-campus-for-redevelopment/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Glenview’s Allstate</a> corporate campus is on the precipice of a total transformation now that its sale has been finalized.","2775 Sanders Road Chicago, IL","2775 Saunders Rd, Northbrook, IL 60062, USA","(42.1009833, -87.8704727, 0.0)",42.1009833,-87.8704727,0.0,2022

It faces a pond, and includes a pool.\nLuxury sales in the suburbs jumped 40 percent in 2020, and Lake Forest led the way.The city saw the biggest increase in home sales over 2019, with 149 homes sold — a 69 percent jump, according to a recent report.\nThe most expensive Lake Forest property now on the market is an $11 million mansion that overlooks Lake Michigan. Over the past four years, there have been two Lake Forest mansions that have sold for over $6 million, according to Crain’s.\nTiming is everything. In early February 2020, former Boeing CEO James McNerney and his wife, Haity, listed their Lake Forest mansion for $4.8 million. It was a deep discount from the $7.6 million they had paid more than a dozen years earlier. The home at 1291 Elm Tree Road ended up selling in August, for just under $4 million, according to Redfin.

Sales of homes priced at $4 million or more were up 16 percent in the second quarter, according to Re/Max Premier.Gaska declined comment on the listing Thursday morning. Noah could not be reached for comment.The firm is an active developer around the Chicago area and has had luck already with similar Gold Coast gut-rehabs. Lisek and Pryzjemski in 2014 paid $3.2 million for another mansion in the neighborhood that they gutted, rehabbed and eventually sold to a Red Bull heir for $7.5 million, according to Curbed.Noah earlier this year took out an $87 million mortgage on a vacant block in Noble Square with plans to build a row of walk-up condo buildings.

Capital improvements are also planned for 33 West Monroe Street, two towers in the Illinois Center, One East Wacker Drive and 135 South LaSalle.“Our goal for each building is to welcome tenants and employees back to the office with hospitality-driven upgrades to the lobby, while promoting collaboration and social gatherings through newly constructed lounges, common areas and conference facilities,” said AmTrust President Jonathan Bennett.Chicago tenants are signing leases at buildings with updated amenities, especially in Fulton Market, while older buildings struggle.Class A offices accounted for 80 percent of leases signed this year, according to JLL. In contrast to downtown office buildings suffering from high vacancies, Fulton Market completed 785,000 square feet of new space so far this year, making up about 30 percent of new construction in the past 12 months.AmTrust tried to unload the entire Loop portfolio for about $1.3 billion in May 2019 when demand was high for downtown office space.

The company, led by Joseph Sitt, saw net operating income at the hotel drop 20 percent year-over-year in 2019, even before the pandemic hit the hospitality industry. Thor has tried to sell the hotel at least twice in the last six years, asking $575 million in 2015 according to Bloomberg.“The entire hospitality industry has been devastated by the pandemic,” a spokesperson for Thor told the Financial Times this month.

The deal follows the recent trend of big office leasing companies snatching up smaller firms to expand their footprints.Transwestern is set to expand its Chicago portfolio substantially with the acquisition of MBRE, which oversees leasing in Michigan Plaza, 181 West Madison Street and 550 West Washington Boulevard. The properties will join those for which Transwestern already handles leasing, including 77 West Wacker Drive, 191 North Wacker Drive, The National at 125 South Clark Street and the NBC Tower.Similar acquisitions have been steadily made by other major real estate players for years, consolidating the business into the hands of brokerages geared to serve commercial building owners with large, global portfolios such as Chicago-based JLL and Cushman & Wakefield and Dallas-based CBRE. Transwestern is also one of the biggest providers of property management and commercial leasing services across the nation.MBRE formed by the 1998 merger of New York real estate investors Howard and Edward Milstein with Miglin-Beitler Management, a Chicago-based commercial real estate firm started by well-known real estate investors J. Paul Beitler and Lee Miglin, whose development firm built 181 West Madison.Developer John Murphy exited his role as MBRE president and vice chairman at the end of 2019.

Napolitano has been trying to block GlenStar’s plans since a similar project was proposed in 2017, arguing that his constituents were concerned about the stress on public resources that higher density housing would cause.Several other aldermen supported the project and said the need for affordable housing in the city outweighed Napolitano and his constituents’ concerns.“We need projects like this all over the city; we need to break precedent sometimes,” Maria Hadden, alderman for the 49th ward, said during the meeting. While the approval “breaks precedent and decorum in how the city has done things,” she said, “we do need to all work together to solve our bigger problems. We have an affordable housing crisis, we have a housing crisis in general, and we need to walk the walk as well as we talk the talk.”The four-year-long back-and-forth between GlenStar and the city on this project has been contentious. After the zoning committee rejected its initial proposal in 2017, GlenStar sued the city, claiming that the city council violated the developer’s right to due process. Before ultimately dropping the suit in 2019, GlenStar claimed that Napolitano was “stonewalling” the project because he didn’t want the lower-income units in his ward.After dropping the suit, GlenStar said it would try to build an office project on the site instead. However, the developer revisited the residential plan in May with hopes that the need for affordable housing in the city would win over many city leaders.Napolitano continued to argue against the project and said that the approval of something in someone else’s ward against their wishes was “a complete overstep of our office.”“Today it’s a commercial [property] that’s being forced into being changed into residential. Tomorrow may be residential to manufacturing in your ward,” Napolitano said at the meeting. “Today I’m sitting in the hot seat. And you may like me, you may hate me — but your decision will definitely reflect the precedent when you are sitting on the hot seat tomorrow. . . .You may be the next person that has to deal with it.”The latest decision from the city council comes at the same time as a federal inspection of aldermanic privilege in Chicago. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is investigating claims that the practice may be contributing to discrimination against low-income minorities.[CT] — Victoria Pruitt\nContact Victoria Pruitt\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Name*\n\n\n\nEmail Address*\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage*All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",8535 West Higgins Road,Chicago’s long-,standing tradition of Aldermanic privilege just took a hit.,"<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/12/15/apartments-near-ohare-approved-despite-objection-from-the-wards-alderman/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Chicago’s long-</a>standing tradition of Aldermanic privilege just took a hit.","8535 West Higgins Road Chicago, IL","8535 W Higgins Rd, Chicago, IL 60631, USA","(41.9857732, -87.8411265, 0.0)",41.9857732,-87.8411265,0.0,2021

The city council previously rejected a plan from Horizon for a 17-story building on the same site after a three-year effort for approval.Evanston’s downtown needs more development to support local businesses, said Horizon Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Michael, according to the RoundTable. The development would generate $1.5 million in revenue and would include 18 affordable units, an increase of about 20 percent to the downtown’s existing supply, he said.“The simple fact is Evanston needs more residents to support the business district,” he said. “And that’s what The Legacy is going to bring – more than 300 new residents living in the heart of Evanston’s business and shopping district , supporting the local economy every day.”Some community members have voiced opposition to the project, citing the building’s imposing size and local zoning laws that would prohibit it, according to a local condo owner.While the affordable housing aspect of the development “looks pretty strong,” according to Sue Loellbach, advocacy manager for Connections for the Homeless, she pushed for units to be marked down as much as possible.“I would love to see the affordability of those affordable units be as deep as possible,” she said.Horizon must file an application for a planned development which would initiate a public hearing process through several committees, the Round Table reported. The city council would then vote on final approval.[RoundTable] — Harrison ConneryAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",31 Chicago Avenue,Horizon Realty Group," is adding more affordable units to a mixed-use development in the Chicago auburn of Evanston, aiming to gain approval from the city council.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2022/02/08/developer-adds-more-affordable-housing-to-evanston-proposal/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Horizon Realty Group</a> is adding more affordable units to a mixed-use development in the Chicago auburn of Evanston, aiming to gain approval from the city council.","31 Chicago Avenue Chicago, IL","31 W Chicago Ave, Chicago, IL 60654, USA","(41.8966556, -87.63023, 0.0)",41.8966556,-87.63023,0.0,2022

The requested loan would be 60 percent of the property’s total value, which the landlord estimates at $140 million.The document lists CVS Pharmacy among a group of companies that have already announced office leases in the 200,000-square-foot building: Google, construction company Leopardo, venture capital firm S2G Ventures and marketing firm Revolution.The five leases bring the building to about 94 percent occupied, according to the document.Representatives of Sterling Bay and JLL declined to comment on the lease. A spokesperson for CVS did not respond to requests for comment.Sterling Bay last secured financing on the property in August 2017, two months before construction got underway, getting a $60.8 million loan from the Union Labor Life Insurance Company, according to Cook County property records.If the CVS opens on the ground floor of the new building, it would be the only pharmacy operating inside Fulton Market. The building Sterling Bay completed last year at 1035 West Randolph Street, now the global headquarters for McDonald’s, has a Walgreens with no pharmacy.Another CVS Pharmacy already operates at 101 North Clinton Street, about a half mile east of the site.The building at 210 North Carpenter is the latest offering in a cluster of office buildings sprouting near the CTA Morgan station since Sterling Bay built new headquarters for McDonald’s and Google, part of an explosion of new workspaces drawing office demand west from the Loop.Shapack Partners and Focus Development are awaiting final permits to begin building a 17-story office building at 167 North Green Street, Murphy Development is preparing to build a smaller office building at 318 North Carpenter Street, and Tishman Speyer joined a bid by Mark Goodman & Associates to build about 225,000 square feet of office at 310 North Sangamon Street.Sterling Bay also is constructing a 19-story office tower at 333 North Green Street, the first of three planned buildings that would bring a combined 1.7 million square feet of new office space to the former Coyne College campus.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",210 North Carpenter Street,Sterling Bay is," courting financiers for its new Fulton Market office complex at 210 North Carpenter Street with the promise that a CVS Pharmacy will take up the building’s entire 12,000-square-foot retail space.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2019/03/11/sterling-bay-eyes-cvs-pharmacy-for-fulton-market-retail-space/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Sterling Bay is</a> courting financiers for its new Fulton Market office complex at 210 North Carpenter Street with the promise that a CVS Pharmacy will take up the building’s entire 12,000-square-foot retail space.","210 North Carpenter Street Chicago, IL","210 N Carpenter St, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","(41.8858649, -87.65344789999999, 0.0)",41.8858649,-87.65344789999999,0.0,2019

It wasn’t immediately clear whether the family member came into contact with the person diagnosed with coronavirus and the risk was believed to be low, but employees were still asked to work from home as the situation evolved, according to an internal email obtained by Crain’s.PepsiCo later sent an update saying the employee and their family member consulted with doctors and show no symptoms of coronavirus.On Tuesday, local developer and landlord Sterling Bay alerted tenants at its massive two-building Prudential Plaza in the Loop after an employee of real estate developer CA Ventures, which is headquartered there, tested positive for coronavirus.

The developer says a City Council committee has shelved the plan because the local alderman objects to its affordable housing component.GlenStar proposed the project at 8535 West Higgins Road in March 2017, and received a number of approvals. But plans halted when the Council’s zoning committee deferred a vote after Alderman Anthony Napolitano, who represents the 41st Ward, objected, according to Crain’s.In a lawsuit filed this week in Cook County Circuit Court, GlenStar claimed Napolitano initially gave his support to the project but did a flip-flop after another proposal for affordable housing in a neighboring ward came under fire from residents there. The suit said Napolitano opposes the project because of the affordable housing component. The zoning committee’s refusal to consider it for a vote effectively stops the project, according to the suit.With few exceptions, the Council typically defers to the local alderman’s wishes on development and zoning issues. Alderman Tom Tunney, who represents the 44th Ward, was the only member of the Plan Commission to vote against the GlenStar plan, citing Napolitano’s opposition to it.Napolitano has said the size of the project would put a strain on local schools and police and would lead to overcrowding. GlenStar called that opposition “contrived” in the lawsuit, according to Crain’s. Napolitano pulled his support of the project after the separate Jefferson Park affordable housing controversy “because he was concerned about the inclusion of affordable units in the proposed development,” the lawsuit said.Napolitano chief of staff Chris Vittorio told Crain’s that claim was “disingenuous” and meant “to put the alderman in a bad light and say he’s against affordable housing.”\xa0[Crain’s] — John O’BrienAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",8535 West Higgins Road,GlenStar Properties, is suing the city for blocking its plan to build a 299-unit apartment complex on the Northwest Side.

The second condo that was recently purchased is a four-bedroom, five-bathroom unit on the 67th floor that sold for a little more than $7 million.The latest pair of sales add to the growing list of units in the tower that have sold at multimillion dollar prices. Of the 393 units, the St. Regis has sold six for more than $6 million. Recently, Magellan Development CEO David Carlins paid $6.5 million for a four-bedroom, five-bathroom unit on the 68th floor of the luxury condo and hotel skyscraper his firm built.The luxury tower offers units that range in price from $840,000 to $18.5 million. Some of the more expensive units available include the Sky 360 penthouses. The full-floor penthouse units begin on the 71st floor and offer 360-degree views of the Chicago skyline.The tower, which was designed by Jeanne Gang’s architecture firm Studio Gang, features such amenities as an outdoor pool, a fitness center, screening room, children’s activity room and a conference center.According to data from Crain’s, in an average year the city sells about 50 properties for $4 million or more — with the last property usually being sold at the end of the year. However, this year, Chicago has already seen 63 units sell for that price or higher. If luxury sales continue on this trajectory, 2021 could surpass 2018’s record 73 luxury units sold.Out of the top 10 sales for 2021, nine are located in the city — six of which are downtown condos — and the other property was a $7.7 million megamansion in the suburb of Hinsdale.[Crain’s] — Victoria PruittAll rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]","393 units, the St",Buyers have snatched," up two more multimillion-dollar condos in the St. Regis tower in Lakeshore East, as the city’s high-end luxury market heads for a record.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2021/09/30/two-st-regis-condos-sell-for-more-than-6m-as-chicago-set-to-break-luxury-sales-record/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Buyers have snatched</a> up two more multimillion-dollar condos in the St. Regis tower in Lakeshore East, as the city’s high-end luxury market heads for a record.","393 units, the St Chicago, IL","Chicago, IL, USA","(41.8781136, -87.6297982, 0.0)",41.8781136,-87.6297982,0.0,2021

The deal would also include 10,000 square feet of retail space inside the 700,000-square-foot skyscraper.Apple’s rent at the site, its flagship in the city, is well below the $400 to $500 per square foot price typically paid for space along the storied strip.The store opened last October, and made headlines in the winter when ice and snow began sliding off its sloping roof, creating hazards for pedestrians.Apple has called it the company’s “most ambitious”store because of its iconic location, pavilion-like structure overlooking the Chicago River, and its marquee location.

Michael Drew (Credit: Structured Development)Structured Development won a key city OK to build 197 apartments and 150,000 square feet of retail and office space near the three-year-old New City complex it developed on the Near North Side.The Chicago Plan Commission on Thursday gave the Chicago-based firm the go-ahead for its $56 million proposal for The Shops at Big Deahl, a 3-acre complex set to be anchored by a Planet Granite climbing gym at the corner of Dayton Avenue and Blackhawk Street.Minutes later, the commission approved Structured Development’s proposal for a seven-story residential building on the 55,600-square-foot current site of the Menomenee Club, kitty-corner from the Shops at Big Deahl.The nonprofit club turned over its property at 1505 North Dayton Avenue to the developer in exchange for a new 50,000-square-foot facility to be built next door to the retail complex. Structured Development also donated to an endowment club for the fund, and plans to build a 18,000-square-foot park between the retail mall and the new club.The new residential building on the current club site will include one-bedroom, two-bedroom and duplex apartments ranging from 833 to 1,253 square feet. An amenity deck will include a “dog spa” and “dog run,” according to the developer’s presentation.Structured Development will include five affordable units and pay about $1.9 million into the city’s low-income housing trust fund, in accordance with the city’s 2015 affordability ordinance. The property falls inside the city’s Near North pilot zone, which mandates 20 percent affordable units, but it did not need to meet the higher mandate because an earlier version of the planned development was approved before the new rules went into effect.The developer plans to begin construction on the club next spring, aiming to complete the entire array of buildings by 2022.New City was built on the former grounds of the Cabrini-Green public housing community, which was demolished between 1995 and 2011. The new complex includes 199 apartments and 360,000 square feet of retail anchored by a Mariano’s grocery store and an ArcLight movie theater.Earlier this year, Bucksbaum Retail Management signed Strive Logistics to a 20,000-square-foot lease at New City.All rights reserved © 2022 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.The Real Deal's newsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and things to know within the industry.By clicking Subscribe you agree to our Privacy Policy.Round-up top news and topics for each of the following citiesSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive belowSelect the newsletter you'd like to receive below""]",1505 North Dayton Avenue,Structured," Development won a key city OK to build 197 apartments and 150,000 square feet of retail and office space near the three-year-old New City complex it developed on the Near North Side.","<a href=""https://therealdeal.com/chicago/2018/10/18/structured-development-wins-city-ok-for-197-apartments-150k-of-retail-near-north-and-clybourn/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Structured</a> Development won a key city OK to build 197 apartments and 150,000 square feet of retail and office space near the three-year-old New City complex it developed on the Near North Side.","1505 North Dayton Avenue Chicago, IL","1505 N Dayton St, Chicago, IL 60642, USA","(41.9087061, -87.6490712, 0.0)",41.9087061,-87.6490712,0.0,2018

In 2014, Los Angeles-based Oaktree replaced USAA as partner in the property, and together with GlenStar took out a $160.8 million mortgage on it. The venture refinanced the debt in 2017 with a $177.7 million loan, according to Crain’s.The 44-story building serves as the cornerstone of the Financial District, where office landlords are bracing for an uncertain future with the looming departures of Bank of America, BMO Harris and Northern Trust. The three banks’ plans to leave their Financial District offices for newer downtown buildings by 2022 would leave 1.85 million square feet of office space in the area vacant.The older buildings in the Financial District will have to vie for tenants against new, amenity-rich towers in River North, the West Loop and elsewhere, and landlords likely will have to spend to upgrade and compete.The Board of Trade building is 21 percent vacant, well above the Downtown average of 13 percent, but was more than half empty when GlenStar bought it, according to Crain’s.HFF is marketing the building.

The seller is R2 Companies, which gained from the sale after buying the site for $22.2 million four years ago. R2 took out a $12 million mortgage on the property, according to Bisnow.Plans for the WGN property haven’t been undisclosed, but the television station’s lease agreement for the 131,000-square-foot building doesn’t expire for more than five years.The Bradley Business Center at 2500 West Bradley Place, for which Hines agreed to pay about $97.3 million, is zoned for as much as 1.6 million square feet of space, giving an option for Hines to expand the campus to WGN. The four-building, 23-acre industrial and office complex is 96 percent leased with tenants including RCN of Chicago, multiple medical offices and other businesses such as IK Gymnastics.Hines, known for building downtown high rises, is part of a joint venture developing the 60-story Salesforce Tower at 333 West Wolf Point Plaza. The company broke ground on the 820-foot-tall tower in April last year after securing a $500 million-plus construction loan. Hines expects to complete construction at the end of next year.
