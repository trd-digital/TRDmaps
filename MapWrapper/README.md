# GraphicsWrapper
 
## A quick and easy way to upload mutiple maps...or any graphics really...to GitHub to publish on GitHub pages.

This is a simple program that facilites uploading multiple maps/graphics to GitHub. This script was written to help Data Jouranlists rapidly upload content to GitHub and publish via GitHubpages, which can then be referenced on the respective media sites.

It comes with some pre-written CSS to help with responsiveness. (Thank you Will Jarrett!)
